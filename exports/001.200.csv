"Maj. Gen. Harry H. Vaughan, whose actions as confidant and aide-de-camp to President Truman a generation ago led to a series of national uproars, died here yesterday at DeWitt Army Hospital.",3175,1981-05-22 00:00:00,"Maj. Gen. Harry H. Vaughan, whose actions as confidant and aide-de-camp to President Truman a generation ago led to a series of national uproars, died here yesterday at DeWitt Army Hospital. He was 87 years old.

 General Vaughan's reputation ranged from that of White House court jester to national menace, depending on the severity of the storm engulfing him at a particular moment.

 General Vaughan traded barbs with the likes of Drew Pearson, the columnist, and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, who accused the Presidential aide of being an influence-peddling ''5 percenter,'' a term applied to those who offered to get Government contracts for businesses for a fee, usually 5 percent. The general, called to testify about his activities by a Senate committee, was reprimanded for accepting seven home freezers as gifts for himself and highranking friends.

 When Mr. Truman was urged by Mr. Pearson to dismiss General Vaughan after it was disclosed that the general had accepted a medal from the neofascist Argentine Government, the President retorted, ''No S.O.B. is going to tell me who to have on my staff or in my Cabinet.'' The remark touched off a national outburst of tongueclucking.

 Awards for Gallantry

 Yet General Vaughan, who retired from the Army in January 1953, was hardly a summer soldier. He was awarded two Silver Stars for gallantry and the French Croix de Guerre for bravery in World War I, in which he served alongside Mr. Truman.

 The two men from Missouri met at Fort Sill, Okla., in 1917 when both were young lieutenants in the field artillery. Lieutenant Vaughan managed to extricate Lieutenant Truman from a dressing-down given by their brigade commander, and they became friends for life.

 They served in the Army Reserves between the wars and at the outbreak of World War II, with Mr. Truman serving in the United States Senate, Mr. Vaughan returned to active duty as a lieutenant colonel. He was injured in a plane crash in Australia in 1943, and while being treated at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington was transferred to the staff of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee investigating arms procurement that was headed by Senator Truman.

 General Vaughan made many trips to battlefields as an investigator for the committee, whose uncovering of deception by the munitions industry led to national prominence for Senator Truman, and the Senator's eventual selection by President Roosevelt as his running mate in 1944.

 Aide to the Vice President

 After the election the new Vice President named then-Brigadier General Vaughan as his military aide, a rare appointment for a reserve officer. In Mr. Truman's eight years as Vice President and then President, he and General Vaughan were the charter members of a group that met frequently to play poker, swap stories and drink bourbon with branch water.

 Mr. Truman and his aide often had lunch together and followed the meal with a swim in the White House pool. Once admonished for having too much influence over the President, General Vaughan retorted: ''The President and I discuss numerous things, but my influence over him is doubtful. I don't suppose anyone gives him more advice than I do, or has less of it used.''

 General Vaughan was born in Glasgow, Mo., on Nov. 26, 1893, and grew up in St. Louis. He received a bachelor's degree from Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., in 1916.

 General Vaughan, whose wife died in 1975, is survived by a son, a daughter and three grandchildren. Funeral services will be Saturday in Alexandria, Va.","May 22, 1981, Friday, Late City Final Edition  HARRY H. VAUGHAN, MAJOR GENERAL WHO WAS AN AIDE TO TRUMAN,DIES"

"John Merrill Olin, honorary chairman of the Olin Corporation and a noted conservationist, philanthropist and inventor, died Wednesday at his home in East Hampton, L.I.",40294,1982-09-10 00:00:00,"John Merrill Olin, honorary chairman of the Olin Corporation and a noted conservationist, philanthropist and inventor, died Wednesday at his home in East Hampton, L.I. He was 89 years old.

 Mr. Olin was the son of Franklin W. Olin, the founder of one of the companies that became the Olin Corporation, a large, diversified manufacturing concern.

 He had been a director of Olin and its predecessors since 1922. He was named president of Olin Industries when it was formed in 1944 and, when Olin merged with the Mathieson Chemical Corporation in 1954, he was elected chairman of the combined Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation.

 Mr. Olin remained chairman until 1957, then held the posts of chairman of the executive committee and the finance and operating committees. In 1963, he was named honorary chairman of the board.

 Breeder of Horses and Dogs

 But his activities ranged far beyond business, and he achieved notable successes in all of them. He was a breeder of saddle and thoroughbred race horses and one, Cannonade, earned more than $500,000 in purses and won the Kentucky Derby in 1974. He also raised champion-class Labrador retrievers. King Buck, one of his Labradors, was the breed's national champion in 1952 and 1953.

 Mr. Olin was also a tireless promoter of free enterprise and the capitalist system, and in their behalf he founded in 1953 the John M. Olin Foundation, which provided support for the economic, political and philosophical principles on which he believed American capitalism rested. By 1977, the foundation's grants reached $1 million a year.

 ''My greatest ambition now,'' he said in an interview in 1977, ''is to see free enterprise re-established in this country. Business and the public must be awakened to the creeping stranglehold that socialism has gained here since World War II.''

 Also in 1977, Mr. Olin chose former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon to succeed him as president of the foundation ''because his fundamental thinking and philosophy are almost identical with mine.''

 24 Patented Inventions

 Mr. Olin was also the inventor or co-inventor of 24 United States patents in the fields of arms and ammunition manufacture and design. An ardent sportsman, Mr. Olin was also a longtime supporter of nature and wildlife conservation. He was especially noted for his efforts to preserve the Atlantic salmon.

 Mr. Olin was born on Nov. 10, 1892, in East Alton, Ill., the son of Franklin Olin and the former Mary Moulton. He received a B.S. degree from Cornell University in 1913 and then went to work as a chemical engineer for the Western Cartridge Company, which had been founded by his father and his brother, Spencer.

 He was an assistant to the president and then a first vice president and a director of Western Cartridge until he was named president of Olin Industries, a consolidation of Western Cartridge, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company and an earlier Olin Corporation.

 Olin's main products now are chemicals, metals and industrial papers, as well as such consumer products as sporting ammunition and skis and commercial water treatment chemicals.

 Received Many Honors

 Mr. Olin was a trustee emeritus of Cornell and of Johns Hopkins University, a life trustee of Washington University in St. Louis and an honorary director of the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

 In 1968 he was given the Charles F. Kettering award by George Washington University. He was also awarded the Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur by France and the Grand Ufficiale-Ordine al Merito by Italy. He was named to the Hunting Hall of Fame in 1974.

 In addition to his home in East Hampton, Mr. Olin had an apartment in Manhattan, a residence in Ladue, Mo., and a hunting plantation near Albany, Ga.

 Mr. Olin is survived by his wife, the former Evelyn Brown; a daughter, Evelyn Williams, of St. Louis; his brother, Spencer, of St. Louis; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

"James H. Smith Jr., a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and foreign aid administrator under President Eisenhower, died yesterday at a hospital in La Jolla, Calif., after suffering from cancer for two years.",40639,1982-11-25 00:00:00,"James H. Smith Jr., a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and foreign aid administrator under President Eisenhower, died yesterday at a hospital in La Jolla, Calif., after suffering from cancer for two years. He was 72 years old.

 In recent years he had served as a vice chairman and trustee emeritus of the Aspen Institute, an educational conference center. As head of the International Cooperation Agency in the 1950's, Mr. Smith was an energetic advocate of maintaining a strong American foreign aid program, often defending it against critics in Congress.

 ''One thing we are not trying to do and should not do is to buy friends with this program,'' he once said. ''You cannot buy friends with a program of economic assistance. We are trying to strengthen the economies of this uncommitted area of the world so they can be independent of any foreign domination, including even the domination of the United States itself.''

 Early Interest in Aviation

 Mr. Smith was a former Navy pilot and airline executive, and his interest in aviation dated from his teen-age years. On Aug. 12, 1927, he soloed in a Curtiss Jenny, and his instructor was Charles A. Lindbergh, who three months before had flown the first nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic. Mr. Smith was at one time a vice president of Pan American World Airways.

 James Hopkins Smith Jr. was born in New York City on Dec. 15, 1909; his mother was the first woman member of the Republican National Committee. He attended Groton School, was graduated from Harvard in 1931 and then enlisted in the Naval Reserve. A year later he entered Columbia Law School and received a degree, but he never practiced law.

 He served as a Navy pilot from 1933 to 1941, then became manager of operations in Africa for Pan Am. But he returned to active duty in 1943 and retired with the rank of captain 10 years later. In the same period, he moved to Colorado and acquired the North Star Ranch at Aspen.

 He had served as a special assistant to the Secretary of the Navy, and in 1953 President Eisenhower named him Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air.

 Admitted Mistaken Dismissal

 A year later, in a widely publicized move, he publicly admitted an error in discharging a Navy civilian employee as a security risk. When inquiry showed the charges against Abraham Chasanow were unfounded, Mr. Smith called a news conference to apologize for the ''grave injustice,'' pledging that security procedures would be revised.

 After resigning from the naval post in 1956, he took up life as a Colorado rancher but returned to Washington when President Eisenhower named him to the foreign aid agency, which he directed from 1957 until 1959.

 He is survived by his wife, Diane; a son, Morgan Smith, and three daughters, Joy, Dinah and Sandra Smith. A memorial service will be held in Aspen on Wednesday.","November 25, 1982, Thursday, Late City Final Edition  JAMES H. SMITH JR.; LED U.S. AID AGENCY"
"Dr. Robert J. Kibbee, the chancellor of the City University of New York, died at his Manhattan home last night at the age of 60.",19158,1982-06-17 00:00:00,"Dr. Robert J. Kibbee, the chancellor of the City University of New York, died at his Manhattan home last night at the age of 60. His death, after a long illness, came two weeks before he was to retire from the post he had held for more than a decade.

 Dr. Kibbee's tenure as chancellor of the country's third largest university coincided with one of the most painful eras of the institution, which was set up in 1961 through the amalgamation of the city's various publicly supported colleges.

 The second year of the controversial policy of open admissions, under which the City University admitted all city high school graduates who applied, was just beginning as he took over the leadership in 1971 from Dr. Albert H. Bowker, who became chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley.

 Dr. Kibbee, who had acquired most of his experience at selective private institutions, found himself called upon repeatedly to defend the City University from the attacks of critics. They charged that the university's academic quality was being diluted to absorb thousands of freshmen who were inadequately prepared to enroll in an institution that until 1970 had maintained rigorous entrance requirements.

 In his firm support for the university during those days of difficult transition, Dr. Kibbee showed the unflappable exterior that was to help him remain cool during the many crises that followed.

 Doing the Best You Can

 ''You start from the point that you think you know what you are trying to do,'' Dr. Kibbee said in discussing his ability to withstand the pressures of that period. ''You do the best you can and recognize that everything is not going to happen the way you want it to happen. There is always tomorrow and you shouldn't look on every setback as a disaster.''

 The decade proved to be a difficult time for all of American higher education, and Dr. Kibbee ended up having to guide the City University through a series of financial difficulties. He frequently was called upon to use his patient style to arbitrate conflicts over budget reductions.

 A 10 percent cut in the institution's $550 million budget during the 1975-76 academic year set the stage for a lengthy drama. Several campuses of the 20-unit system were threatened with extinction, the institution's suppliers were not paid and the entire university finally closed for two weeks in May, just as final examinations were approaching.

 Reneging on a Commitment

 To Dr. Kibbee, the worst part of the crisis was having to dismiss 2,000 faculty members who had been awarded new contracts just six months earlier. ''We had a commitment to them and then we reneged,'' he said several years later. ''It just wasn't fair, but the financial problem didn't allow any other solution.''

 The price of getting the university reopened was the abandonment of its cherished free-tuition policy. Through it all, Dr. Kibbee was a central figure, successfully resisting proposals for a takeover by the State University of New York and not shying away from political infighting when he thought it necessary.

 This was a portent, and during the middle and late 1970's, Dr. Kibbee found himself increasingly honing skills more characteristic of a politican than of a scholar.

 He was confronted by a Board of Higher Education whose members often appeared, at least to the chancellor's supporters, to subordinate academic needs to political considerations, and he found the appointment of presidents for the university's various campuses to be a matter of keen interest among elected officeholders who were not averse to trying to influence the selection process.

 In April 1981, Dr. Kibbee announced that he would retire from the chancellorship this month, giving the trustees 14 months to find his successor. Although he had undergone cranial surgery several months earlier, he said the state of his health was not a factor in his decision, explaining: ''I'm not as active and agile as when I came here, but I'm 10 years older.''

 The search for Dr. Kibbee's successor, which began when he announced his retirement, was within days of completion at the time of his death.

 More Than Just Academics

 Dr. Kibbee was a pragmatist who resisted efforts to cast his role as chancellor in philosophical terms. ''It's always nice to think of yourself as the academic chieftain of an intellectually oriented body,'' he said. ''But it costs money and takes buildings and equipment to have a university. This is the responsibility of the chief executive, and if you're not willing to accept it, then you should stay out of this business.''

 Opponents were often bemused and frustrated by Dr. Kibbee's seemingly bland approach. The president of one of the university's units theorized that the only signals that the stolid Dr. Kibbee, a rumpled six-footer, ever gave of his perturbance were a few extra puffs from his omnipresent pipe.

 Even when his independence provoked both the Governor and the Mayor to seek his ouster, Dr. Kibbee remained mostly taciturn, accepting criticism in silence or, at most, delivering one of the dry witticisms that were one of his trademarks.

 ''If you can live long enough, you will outlast your critics,'' he said to close associates on several occasions when the university faced adversity.

 A lack of effusiveness, however, did not mean Dr. Kibbee was insensitive. He held fierce loyalties, was quick to voice compassion and was always among the first to commiserate with colleagues suffering personal problems.

 Dr. Kibbee's background may have helped develop his empathy with others. He was born on Aug. 19, 1921, on Staten Island, and his parents separated when he was a small boy. He carried both the blessing and the burden of growing up as the son of a famous father, Guy Kibbee, the actor.

 Served in Antiaircraft Unit

 His mother moved the family to Manhattan's West Side, and the young Bob Kibbee became an inveterate New Yorker. He attended Xavier High School and went on to earn his bachelor's degree at Fordham University, where the show-business connections established through his father won him a reputation for being able to get his friends into concerts by the popular big bands.

 He went into the Army after his graduation from Fordham in 1943 and was serving in an antiaircraft unit in the Phillipines when World War II ended in 1945.

 After his military discharge, Dr. Kibbee attended the University of Chicago, earning a master's degree in 1947 in educational administration. His involvement in a lengthy study of higher education in Arkansas led to an appointment as a dean at Southern State College in that state.

 In 1955, Dr. Kibbee moved to Drake University in Iowa as dean of students. He also resumed his studies at the University of Chicago, earning a doctorate in higher educational administration in 1957.

 Became Adviser in Pakistan

 Dr. Kibbee left Drake the following year to represent the University of Chicago as an educational adviser in Pakistan, a job that expanded to a three-year assignment and included membership on a committee that redesigned the country's educational system.

 He returned to the United States in 1961, joining the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh as assistant to the president, John C. Warner, whom he had known as one of the other consultants in Pakistan. In 1965, Dr. Kibbee was promoted to vice president and continued in a similar position after a merger that created Carnegie-Mellon University.

 Dr. Kibbee was a surprise choice to head the City University, an institution unlike any with which he had been associated during his academic career.

 Despite the public exposure associated with the $69,100-a-year job, he maintained a very private personal life, and few of those who worked closely with him were aware of his interest in the ballet or the enjoyment he derived from an occasional round of golf.

 Making Private Life Public

 Dr. Kibbee himself took the initiative on one of the few occasions when his personal life became public. In 1973, he sent letters to each of the campus presidents in the City University and to the members of the Board of Higher Education telling of his separation from his wife, the former Katherine Kirk.

 He was remarried in the spring of 1980 to Margaret Rockwitz, a faculty member at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn. The marriage took place while Dr. Kibbee was convalescing from cranial surgery for the removal of a tumor that was reportedly nonmalignant. He returned to work that spring, but even a year later still looked drawn and did not appear to have regained his former vigor.

 In a commencement address just last week, Dr. Kibbee counseled the graduating class at Brooklyn College to be humble and compassionate and to ''temper your judgments to the limit of your knowledge.'' He did not appear at the commencement because of his declining health; his address was read to the 2,900 graduates at the Flatbush campus by Jerald Posman, a vice chancellor.

 Dr. Kibbee, stressing to the graduates that the only advantage he had over them was longevity, said that ''what I have learned by living is that there is too much arrogance, simple-mindedness and indifference in the world.''

He was 92 years old.

 Dr. Ham was an associate professor of English literature at Yale University when, in 1936, the Mount Holyoke trustees chose him to replace Mary E. Woolley as president of the college. The school was about to mark its 100th academic year.

 The choice of a man sparked some opposition among alumnae, and Dr. Woolley herself declared that it was a ''blow to the advancement of women.'' But the trustees stuck by their decision, the undergraduate weekly urged all involved to calm down, and Dr. Ham took office in September 1937 to steer the college into an era of expansion.

 Particularly in the years after World War II, Mount Holyoke added to its campus in South Hadley, Mass., and its financial assets. Under Dr. Ham's stewardship, it built new dormitories and other facilities, including a modern chemistry building, a sports complex, a radio studio and a nursery school.

 The college also reaffirmed its dedication to women's eduation, and its student body has remained all-female.

 Son of Gold Rush Miner

 Roswell Gray Ham was born March 11, 1891, in Lemoore, Calif. His father, 69 years old that year, was a gold rush miner. Dr. Ham took his undergraduate studies at the University of California. He started his academic career as an instructor in English at the University of Washington and then went to his alma mater to teach.

 When the United States entered World War I, Dr. Ham joined the Marine Corps. After the war, he went to graduate school at Yale and earned his doctorate in English literature in 1925 while working as an instructor. He was at Yale for 16 years before taking on the presidency of Mount Holyoke.

 Dr. Ham was elected to the Elizabethan Club at Yale in 1926 and, with a Sterling Fellowship, studied 17th century English tragic drama at the British Museum and the libraries of Cambridge and Oxford Universities and the National Library in Paris.

 Classroom Teaching Continued

 He continued to teach regularly as college president. His studies also resulted in numerous articles and books on the classic English dramatists John Dryden, Nathaniel Lee and Thomas Otway.

 After his retirement, Dr. Ham continued his research in 17th century English literature. He lived in Nantucket, Mass., several years before moving to Santa Barbara, where both his sons lived.

 Dr. Ham is survived by his sons, Cornelius Kimball Ham and David Ham, both of Santa Barbara, eight grandchildren and one greatgrandson.

"Bricktop, the legendary singer and entertainer whose cafe society nightclubs in Paris in the 20's and in Mexico City and Rome in the postwar years drew royalty, writers and the fashionably riffraff, died in her sleep early yesterday in her apartment on West 68th Street.",36515,1984-02-01 00:00:00,"Bricktop, the legendary singer and entertainer whose cafe society nightclubs in Paris in the 20's and in Mexico City and Rome in the postwar years drew royalty, writers and the fashionably riffraff, died in her sleep early yesterday in her apartment on West 68th Street. She was 89 years old and had been in fragile health.

 Thousands of her friends on several continents called the once red-haired doyenne of cafe society by the Bricktop nickname, and her fashionable clubs were also called Bricktop. But her real name was more impressive - Ada Beatrice Queen Victoria Louise Virginia Smith.

 Her fame was as widespread as it was legendary. She taught the Prince of Wales and future Duke of Windsor the Black Bottom in her small but ultra-chic bo,ite on Place Pigalle in Paris in the 20's. Cole Porter, whom she taught the Charleston, wrote specially for her a drama-in-song called ''Miss Otis Regrets,'' based on the Frankie-and-Johnny legend.

 Ernest Hemingway, Evelyn Waugh and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald got drunk at Bricktop's, and the carrot- topped entertainer once threw out John Steinbeck for being ''ungentlemanly.'' He got back into her good graces by sending her a taxi loaded with roses.

 'Fascinated by Saloons'

 Brick, or Brickie, as some of her legions of admirers often called her, was born on Aug. 14, 1894. She was a nonstop, stream-of-consciousness talker, and she loved telling her own colorful life story.

 ''I was born in Alderson, West, by God, Virginia,'' she told one interviewer a decade ago. ''My mother was the whitest Negro that ever lived, and she was certainly shanty Irish. I was always fascinated with saloons. As a kid on State Street in Chicago, I was always running under the swinging doors. I was in the chorus of a Negro theater at 15 - don't say 'black,' I hate 'black,' I'm 100 percent American Negro with a trigger Irish temper.''

 In the early 1920's, Bricktop sang in Connie's Inn in Harlem, then moved on to Paris. ''I was sent for to sing in a little nightclub,'' she said. ''Cole Porter brought me to Venice to sing and dance on his barge for his private parties. In those days there was no such thing as the jet set. It was the set. Darling, either you're born in it or you're not. If you were born in the gutter you can get polish, but some day you'll fall back in the gutter.''

 Despite her seeming, occasionally, to put on such airs, Bricktop cultivated a reputation for being everyone's friend in her nightclubs, managing to have pleasant, although usually brief, chats with all her guests. She seldom stayed at a table more than five minutes, however, and, she once insisted, ''I never have a drink with a guest unless they've begged me three or four times.'' Her formula seemed to work, for her guests and customers vied with one another to assure her of their love.

 I'm a Personality'

 ''When I'm alone with anyone,'' she once said, ''I call them 'darling.' Except the Duke of Windsor. I have always called him 'Sire.' ''

 Such a pronouncement was often followed by a more self-effacing observation: ''You know, darling, Cole Porter wrote 'Miss Otis Regrets' for me, but I'm no singer, I'm a personality. Nobody ever came to hear me, they came to see me.''

 Not long before Bricktop returned to New York after the Depression dimmed the City of Light, she hired an unknown English singer named Mabel Mercer, who remained her lifelong friend. Earlier, she had taken another newcomer, Josephine Baker, under her wing, and she also counted as her protege Duke Ellington.

 In her auitobiography, ''Bricktop by Bricktop,'' written with James Haskins and published last year on her 89th birthday, the entertainer told of some hard times in New York in the 1940's. In 1943, she said, her old friend, the heiress Doris Duke, lent her money to set up a club in Mexico City. In 1950, she returned briefly to Paris, but was repelled by postwar anti-Americanism there and moved on to Rome.

 Bricktop's on the Via Veneto was a mecca for American and European tourists, but its owner once told a friend: ''Compared to my little 14-table spot in Paris years ago, this place is a dump.'' She finally gave up the nightspot in 1961. Her departure was noted in one newspaper in these words:

 ''Singing, dancing, cigar-smoking Bricktop, who has reigned as American nightclub queen in Europe for 40 years, announced her abdication today. 'I'm tired, honey, tired of staying up till dawn every day,' the 67-year-old, freckle-faced entertainer said.''

 There were occasional attempts at comebacks in New York over the next few years, but as the entertainer's health worsened, she became less and less active. She never lost interest in charity work, however, particularly for the Roman Catholic Church, to which she was a convert.

 She always took her religion seriously, but Bricktop, who said she ''was married a few years to a saxophone player and a great gentleman,'' Peter Duconge, laughed when her friends teased her about her conversion.

 ''They say I'm a religious fanatic, because I'm always running in and out of church,'' she said. ''For 40 years I was running in and out of bars, and they didn't call me a fanatic.''

Engstrom, a former president of the RCA Corporation and a leader in the development of color television, died Tuesday at the Meadow Lakes Retirement Community in Hightstown, N.J. He was 83 years old.

 Mr. Engstrom was named president of the Radio Corporation of America, which became the RCA Corporation, in 1961 after 31 years with the company, largely in research and development.

 He gave up the title of president in 1965, but remained chief executive officer until 1968 and chairman of the executive committee until his retirement in 1969.

 An Electronic Breakthrough

 Mr. Engstrom became president when color television was in its infancy, and he played a major role in the electronic breakthrough that enabled his company to produce the industry's first color television tube.

 ''This is really a frontier industry,'' he said in an interview then. ''The bulk of our electronic products and services today seems to consist of the improbabilities of yesterday. It would take a gift of prophecy bordering on the supernatural to predict in detail what we may be producing in another 10 years.''

 Mr. Engstrom, a native of Minneapolis, joined the General Electric Company in 1923 in Schenectady, N.Y., after his graduation from the University of Minnesota.

 In 1930, with the transferral of General Electric's radio and engineering activities to RCA, Mr. Engstrom was named the RCA division engineer in charge of developing equipment for sound motion pictures. He later became supervising engineer for developing and producing broadcast receivers.

 He directed RCA's program of television research and development and eventually headed the development of the company's color television system.

 Scholarly and Soft-Spoken

 When RCA's research activities were brought together in Princeton, N.J., Mr. Engstrom was named director of general research. He became senior vice president in 1955 and president in 1961.

 Mr. Engstrom, a scholarly, soft- spoken man, was known at RCA as Dr. Engstrom because of his honorary doctorates from 18 colleges and universities.

 In 1966, he won the Founders Award of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ''for his leadership in management and integration of research and development programs and for his foresighted application of systems engineering concept in bringing television to the public.''

 Mr. Enstrom is survived by his wife, the former Phoebe Leander; a son, William L., of Hightstown; a sister, Bernice Huchthausen of Erwinna, Pa., and a grandchild.

"Michael J. Codd, who as Police Commissioner during New York City's fiscal crisis led a department troubled by thousands of layoffs, died yesterday at his home in Elmhurst, Queens.",57885,1985-08-30 00:00:00,"Michael J. Codd, who as Police Commissioner during New York City's fiscal crisis led a department troubled by thousands of layoffs, died yesterday at his home in Elmhurst, Queens. He was 69 years old.

 A spokesman for the Police Department said Mr. Codd was believed to have suffered a heart attack.

 Mr. Codd rose through the ranks of the department to become Commissioner in 1974 under Mayor Abraham D. Beame.

 Even before taking the post he was known in station houses throughout the city as Chief Straight Arrow - testimony as much to his ramrod-straight military bearing as to his reputation. Six feet tall, 200 pounds, with gray hair, blue eyes and a strong jaw, Mr. Codd looked the part of the old-fashioned, paternal policeman. Whatever the crisis, he kept a gentlemanly calm.

 That calm was sorely tested in the years before he was forced to step aside in December 1977 to allow the incoming Mayor, Edward I. Koch, to name his own Commissioner, Robert McGuire.

 'Held the Department Together'

 By Mr. Codd's own admission, his four-year term in office, which was marked by huge layoffs and forced economies, was ''without parallel in the history of the department.''

 His major contribution during this period, according to his former deputy commissioner for public information, Francis J. McLoughlin, was that ''he held the department together.''

 The current Police Commissioner, Benjamin Ward, himself a former officer, also stressed that theme, praising Mr. Codd as ''an exceptional police professional.''

 Mr. Codd, Commissioner Ward said, ''led the department during its most severe reduction of resources, especially manpower - his competence in that crisis resulted in a continual, uninterrupted, high-caliber police service to the city.''

 'A Guy Who Was Loved'

 Former associates said Mr. Codd was extremely popular with street officers when he was named to head the department, which at the time had 32,000 officers.

 ''Here was a guy who was loved,'' Mr. McLoughlin said yesterday. ''He'd go around to precincts to speak to guys, he got applause and guys came up to shake his hand.''

 But his popularity among officers fell somewhat when he laid off 6,000 officers and froze salaries and promotions.

 The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association talked of a strike, and thousands of officers began street demonstrations during off-duty hours, in part, they said, because they thought Commissioner Codd should have publicly resisted the cutbacks.

 Fined P.B.A. Head

 Mr. Codd threatened severe measures against any police officer who struck, and followed through by putting the P.B.A. head on one-year probation and fined him $7,500 for refusing an assignment and picketing while on duty. Mr. Codd also refused amnesty to police officers for any misconduct during the demonstrations.

 After the heady applause and camaraderie of the early days of his term, the antagonism from some in the department hurt Mr. Codd deeply, Mr. McLoughlin recalled.

 He said Mr. Codd resisted suggestions to demote superior officers to fill depleted patrol ranks because he believed supervisory personnel were even more important in a shrinking department with morale problems.

 Steeped in department lore and concerned about the future, Mr. Codd said, according to Mr. McLoughlin, ''We have to leave the guys after us something that works.''

 Served in the Army

 Mr. Codd was born April 16, 1916, in West Brighton, S.I., one of 10 children of Irish immigrants. After graduating from St. Peter's High School, he worked in a Staten Island grocery store, where he became manager.

 He joined the state police in 1939 and two years later became a probationary New York City patrolman in the 20th Precinct on the West Side.

 He was drafted into the Army less than a year later and served in the military police.

 After the war, he rejoined the Police Department in the 20th Precinct. He rose to sergeant in 1949, lieutenant in 1952, captain in 1959 and deputy inspector in 1961.

 In October 1970, Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy named him chief inspector, bypassing four senior officers, to make him the highest ranking uniformed officer.

 Mr. Codd is survived by his wife, Anne; three daughters, Elizabeth Pigozzi of East Meadow, L.I.; Mary Waldron, of Queens, and Kerry Hannon of Euclid, Ohio; a son, Mark, of Grosse Pointe, Mich.; six brothers, Mark and Bernard, both of Staten Island; John, of Queens; Edward, of Ann Arbor, Mich.; Thomas, of Greenwich, Conn., and Bartholomew of Oakland, N.J.; two sisters, Catherine Breen and Elizabeth O'Connor, both of Staten Island, and seven grandchildren.

"Leonard M.

Ross, a ''whiz kid'' of television quiz shows who became a law professor at Columbia University and an economic adviser to President Carter, was found dead May 1 in a swimming pool in Santa Clara, Calif. He was 39 years old. Lieut. Charles Seymour of the Santa Clara Police Department said yesterday that the death ''appears to be a suicide.''

 ''He was unquestionably a genius,'' said Jesse Choper, the dean of Boalt Hall Law School at the University of California at Berkeley, where Mr. Ross had taught until his resignation last year.

 Mr. Ross attracted national attention as a wunderkind at the age of 7, when he passed a Federal test for a novice ham radio operator's license. At 10, he won $100,000 on a game show called ''The Big Surprise'' with his precocious answers to stock market questions and at 11, he won $64,000 on ''The $64,000 Challenge.''

 He graduated from high school at 14 and earned a degree in economics from the University of California at Los Angeles. He also received a law degree from Yale University and was the editor in chief of The Yale Law Review.

 He was a teaching fellow at the Harvard Law School in the early 1970's, before coming to New York to teach at Columbia law school.

 With Peter Passell, a fellow teacher at Columbia, he wrote ''Retreat from Riches: Affluence and Its Enemies,'' a book that argued that rapid growth as a national policy was the only way to reduce poverty in America.

 He also wrote extensively for The New York Times Magazine, Book Review and the Op-Ed page.

 Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California appointed Mr. Ross to the Public Utilities Commission in 1975, making him one of the youngest members of the commission. He resigned in 1977 to work as a special assistant in economic affairs for the Carter Administration.

Taylor Jr., a former chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and an authority on family planning and cancer research, died Friday in his home in Manhattan. He was 85 years old and had been ill for many months.

 Dr. Taylor was the founding director of the Institute for Human Reproduction at Columbia, the first major scientific institute dedicated solely to research into reproduction and family planning.

 Over the years, his work ranged from studying the relationship between hormones and cancers to the treatment of infertility to world population problems. In 1964, he was one of the first experts to point out a trend in the United States toward voluntary sterilization as a means of birth control.

 Cancer Research

 He also served as the head of several major professional and health organizations, including the American Cancer Society, of which he was the president from 1954 to 1955. In 1959, as chairman of the society's committee on tobacco and cancer, he led an intensified program to alert the public to the dangers of cigarette smoking.

 He was born in New York City in 1900, the son of a prominent gynecologist, and attended Yale University and received his medical degree from Columbia. He began work with the gynecology staff at Roosevelt Hospital in 1928 and was an attending physician there from 1936 to 1946.

 Dr. Taylor was chief of service at Columbia from 1946 through 1965, and a major focus of his work, in addition to the practice of surgery, was clinical research on gynecological cancer. His articles on the physiology of pregnancy and cancer appeared in many journals.

 Family-Planning Research

 In 1965, he was appointed director of the new Human Reproduction Institute, intended to coordinate scientific work on reproduction. ''There is no problem of greater concern to world leaders than the dramatic increase in population,'' he said at the time. ''It's more important in my opinion than conquering heart disease, cancer and stroke.''

 He also served as president of the American Public Health Association and the American Association of Planned Parenthood Physicians, as well as editor in chief of The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

 He is survived by his wife, Caroline; a son, Howard C., of Jericho, Vt.; two daughters, Barbara T. Schoen of Bronxville, N.Y., and Alice T.

"Theodore H. White, the ex-newsboy who became a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist skilled at humanizing events in his ''Making of the President'' books and myriad other writings, died late Thursday night at Lenox Hill Hospital.",20386,1986-05-17 00:00:00,"Theodore H. White, the ex-newsboy who became a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist skilled at humanizing events in his ''Making of the President'' books and myriad other writings, died late Thursday night at Lenox Hill Hospital.

 Mr. White was admitted to the hospital after suffering a stroke last Friday.

 He was 71 years old and lived in a house in Bridgewater, Conn., and a brownstone on the East Side of Manhattan.

 ''A storyteller of elections'' is what the exuberant Mr. White liked to call himself in his later years. ''There is no excitement anywhere in the world, short of war,'' he once wrote, ''to match the excitement of an American Presidential campaign.''

 His excitement was contagious. The British political scientist and author R. H. S. Crossman praised what he called Mr. White's ''brilliant presentation of democracy in action,'' noting that he ''knows the art of creating suspense.''

 Correspondent in China

 Simon Michael Bessie, the editor and publisher of eight of Mr. White's books, beginning with ''The Making of the President 1960,'' at the Atheneum and Harper & Row publishing houses, said: ''Teddy White has made the history and inner working of American politics interesting and intelligible to more people than any other writer of his generation. His gifts as reporter, historian and storyteller have produced books of lasting value.''

 It was after a hardscrabble Depression boyhood and a summa cum laude Harvard degree that Mr. White started out, as a foreign correspondent for Time, covering war and famine in China. He later was co-author of a 1946 book about that country, ''Thunder Out of China,'' which the former New York Times editor Harrison E. Salisbury later called ''indispensable for an understanding of the struggle which brought the Chinese Communists to power.''

 Mr. White also covered the wrenchings of history in India and the spit, polish and drama of the Japanese surrender aboard the the battleship Missouri for Time, finding himself - as he wrote later - ''entranced by power and force during the war years in Asia.''

 Moving on to Europe, he became, as he put it, ''convinced of American virtue during the years of reconstruction'' after World War II. Later, back in the United States, he began seeing American politics ''as an adventure in which men sought their identity.''

 Novel-Writing Techniques

 After working also for The Reporter, Collier's and other publications and writing two works of fiction, he decided, during a quiet weekend on Fire Island, N.Y., in late 1959, to use novel-writing techniques in a book-length chronicle of the next Presidential campaign.

 The upshot was ''The Making of the President 1960,'' which won him national fame and the Pulitzer Prize. Heartened by its success, he went on to write similarly titled works, about the races of 1964, 1968 and 1972, which kept his name on best-seller lists.

 Then came his stinging ''Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon,'' which came out in 1975 and was praised by the Times columnist James Reston as the best of Mr. White's ''superb books on the Presidency.''

 It was followed by Mr. White's stirring and much-praised memoir, ''In Search of History: A Personal Adventure,'' in 1978 and his sweeping and controversial ''America in Search of Itself: The Making of the President 1956-1980'' in 1982.

 'Literature of Reality'

 Summing up himself, as his writings summed up legions of other notable men and women of his time, Mr. White once called himself an author dealing in observed reality - what has come to be called in France ''les choses vues.'' That literary tradition, he said, ''proliferated with my generation.''

 ''The American literature of reality includes John Gunther inside his U.S.A., Edgar Snow following the Red Star over China, John Hersey reporting on Hiroshima,'' Mr. White observed. ''I think I fit in that stream and I'm proud of it.''

 Not only proud, ecstatic. Pounding at his typewriter, peering down through his wire-rimmed glasses at the emerging words, Mr. White used to feel, as he once put it, ''bursts of ecstasy when the hours of writing swept by like minutes, all the words flowing in paragraphs preshaped by unconscious thinking.''

 The joy and success that Mr. White found in his work might have brought serenity to a simpler man. But by late 1975, he wrote in his memoirs, he was angry with himself, mainly because for years he ''had neither paused nor dug deep enough to answer'' the question of what events were ''really all about.''

 Identities and Ideas

 Now it struck him that ''identities in politics were connected far more to ideas than to ego,'' as he wrote then, and that ''at the core of every great political identity lay an idea - an idea imposed on the leader from his past, which the leader absorbed, changed and then imposed on the others outside.''

 Mr. White came to be widely seen as what Robert Sherrill, writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1982, called someone ''who with age and success has turned conservative.'' But Mr. White viewed himself in a different light.

 ''I don't think of myself as a conservative,'' he once said. ''I believe that dogma - and that includes liberal and conservative dogma - must not take precedence over reality. A liberal is a person who believes that water can be made to run uphill. A conservative is someone who believes everybody should pay for his water. I'm somewhere in between: I believe water should be free, but that water flows downhill.''

 Regardless of ideology, Mr. White, who was widely known as Teddy, was an inspired talker, whether at home, in his clubs or in a favorite East Side restaurant.

 ''Teddy was as brilliant a conversationalist as he was a writer; he made history live,'' Julian Bach, his literary agent, observed. ''In his conversation, when he got going, on politics, history or social history or about people in the news, he would lean forward and his whole face would absolutely shine. He would keep everybody glued listening to him.''

 A Depression Boyhood

 Theodore Harold White's early life was more austere, even in some ways bleak. He was born May 6, 1915, in Boston, the first of four children of Mary Winkeller White and David White, a scholarly man, trained as a lawyer, who during the Depression had to collect rents for slumlords to make ends meet.

 The family was poor, Theodore White wrote in ''In Search of History'' - in which he sometimes referred to himself in the third person - so poor that his earliest childhood memory ''was of the sound of his mother crying late one night, crying to his father because there was no money to buy shoes for the children.''

 As a boy, Theodore White rose before dawn to sell newspapers on streetcars. Then, after attending the Boston Latin School, he entered Harvard College on a scholarship awarded to newsboys, majored in history and achieved an early triumph, earning his bachelor's degree summa cum laude in 1938. Later that year a Frederick Sheldon Traveling Fellowship catapulted him to China, which he made his base while he honed his skills reporting for Time.

 He then returned for a time to the United States and wrote his first book, ''Thunder Out of China,'' with Annalee Jacoby as co-author. Then, from 1948 to 1953, Mr. White covered the Marshall Plan, NATO and other aspects of postwar Europe, topics he touched on in his second book, ''Fire in the Ashes,'' which appeared in 1953. Writing in The Times Book Review, Richard Rovere later called it ''superior to anything else to come out of those years of agony and promise.''

 Wrote Two Novels

 When Collier's magazine folded in 1956, Mr. White found himself out of work. He then wrote his first novel, ''The Mountain Road'' (1958), based on his experiences in China, which was subsequently made into a movie with the same title. His second novel, ''The View from the Fortieth Floor'' (1960), was based on his experiences at Collier's.

 After turning in that book to the publisher, Mr. White resolved, as he put it in his memoirs, to ''take the next two years to write a book about how a President is made.''

 ''The idea,'' he continued, ''was to follow a campaign from beginning to end. It would be written as a novel is written, with anticipated surprises as, one by one, early candidates vanish in the primaries until only two final jousters struggle for the prize. Moreover, it should be written as a story of a man in trouble, of the leader under the pressure of circumstances.''

 And so, early in 1960, Mr. White found himself ''waiting in snow-coated Wisconsin for a plane bearing John F. Kennedy,'' then a Senator aspiring to the White House. ''And the Senator, coming off, was saying 'Hi. Hi, Teddy, I heard you were writing a book about the campaign.' ''

 Recalling Kennedy's Tears

 And so, too, on the day after Election Day in 1960, Mr. White found himself watching Mr. Kennedy go before the cameras for the first time as President-elect.

 Mr. Kennedy had tears in his eyes, Mr. White noted in his memoirs, adding, ''I have observed that most men, when elected President and first sensing that they have it all in their hands, break down and wipe tears from their eyes.''

 But minutes later, that particular President-elect was cheerfully taunting Mr. White, saying, ''O.K., Teddy, now you can go ahead and write that book of yours.''

 A week after President Kennedy's assassination, Mr. White, having gained Jacqueline Kennedy's trust, was summoned to the family compound in Hyannisport, Mass. There, after listening to her long and sympathetically, he wrote a Life magazine article which, at her urging, used the word ''Camelot'' to refer to the Kennedy Administration.

 The Sound of Politics

 During the two decades that Mr. White covered Presidential electoral politics, he followed familiar campaign sounds, beginning with, as he wrote in his memoirs, ''the nervous rattle of practicing drums, the shuffle that precedes the parade.''

 ''The sound was almost irresistible,'' he wrote, ''because in American politics it is when the parade is falling in that it is most exciting.''

 And so, he wrote, he followed those sounds ''across the country and back, again and again, and up with the crescendo to the conventions, on through the rallies with pretty girls in shakos and pompons kicking in town squares and crowds yelling in big-city arenas until, suddenly on a November night, there would be a new President.''

 After he won the Pulitzer Prize, for his 1960 ''Making'' book, he got a wry note of congratulation from President Kennedy saying simply: ''It pleases me that I could at least provide a little of the scenario.''

 Responding to Critics

 Though widely praised, the ''Making'' books received some criticism. In 1978, Mr. Rovere called them ''a monument of journalistic enterprise,'' but contended that they were less successful than Mr. White's first two books of reporting, about foreign affairs.

 ''White's respect - love - for the people and institutions he was writing about led him to celebrate some rather shabby characters,'' Mr. Rovere contended.

 Asked about that sort of criticism, Mr. White once replied: ''Look. The only leaders I really hated were Hitler and Stalin. I've tried to see the different sides of people. I've been called anti-Nixon and pro-Nixon. Just say I'm soft on the human race.''

 Mr. White also planned a 1976 ''Making'' book, but the Watergate scandal led him to write ''Breach of Faith'' instead, followed three years later by ''In Search of History.'' That book, Mr. Rovere wrote, had ''all the pace and energy'' of Mr. White's earlier nonfiction works, but ''more insight, more reflection, more candor, more intimacy, more humor, more humility, surer and sharper judgments of those he writes about, including himself.''

 'Lamentation' for America

 But there was some strong criticism of ''America in Search of Itself.'' Mr. Sherrill contended that ''in his zeal to portray the United States as a latter-day crumbling Rome, Mr. White makes some foolish appraisals of our helplessness.''

 ''The chief virtue of this Ecclesiastes-like lamentation,'' Mr. Sherrill said, ''is that it raises some important questions that need to be asked. The chief defect is that it is riddled with so many half-baked assumptions and so many historical details that are sloppily drawn, misleading or just plain wrong.''

 And Susan Bolotin, also writing in The Times, said, ''Mr. White deserves full credit for his talent as a storyteller'' but observed that the book contained an ''underlying bitterness.''

 ''Women get Mr. White's hackles up, and it shows,'' she wrote, adding that ''some blacks might wonder, too,'' at his statement that ''the speeding breakup of black and minority families was putting on the streets young people who were a danger to all.''

 But she noted that ''for more than 20 years'' he had ''worked devilishly hard to hold his position as chief chronicler of America's national electoral process'' and ''more recently, through a combination of experience, longevity and much public exposure, his status has risen to that of quasi statesman.''

 A Partnership Dissolved

 In April 1984, Mr. White was busy covering the prelude to that year's Presidential election when it was announced that his next book, ''The Making of the President 1984,'' would be largely reported and written by Time magazine staff members.

 Mr. White himself was to write three chapters of the book and edit the rest jointly with Ralph Graves, the former editorial director of Time Inc., with whom he had worked in the past.

 But in October of that year, when the book was one third finished, the literary partnership was dissolved. Mr. Bach, Mr. White's literary agent, observed at the time that ''doing a book by committee, as it were, did not prove to be quite the same as doing a book alone.''

 Before he suffered his stroke, Mr. White was writing a second volume of memoirs, to be entitled ''In Search of History, Volume II.'' He had finished about a third of it.

 Won Two Emmy Awards

 Over the years, Mr. White also brought his journalistic skills to television, including documentary television-writing and political commentary, winning Emmy Awards in 1964 and 1967. In addition, he edited the papers of Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, published in 1948, and was the author of a play, ''Caesar at the Rubicon'' (1968).

 In addition, he served as a member of the Board of Overseers of Harvard University, a director of the Encyclopedia Britannica and a trustee of the Asia Society.

 Mr. White married Nancy Ariana Bean in 1947. The marriage ended in divorce in 1971. In 1974 he married Beatrice K. Hofstadter.

 He is survived by his wife; a brother, Robert Mayer White of Bethesda, Md.; a daughter, Ariana Van Der Heyden White, who is known as Heyden, and a son, David Fairbank White, both of Manhattan.

 A memorial service for Mr. White will be held at noon on Tuesday at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The speakers will be Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York; Richard M. Clurman, journalist and close family friend; John King Fairbank, the China scholar who is Francis Lee Higginson Professor of History, Emeritus at Harvard University; Heyden White, and Blair Clark, former editor of The Nation magazine.","May 17, 1986, Saturday, Late City Final Edition  THEODORE H.

 He was a vigorous spokesman for the industry and was often in the public eye. In 1967, he represented the industry in negotiations during a building service strike.

 Opposed Rent Control

 A critic of rent control, Mr. Sulzberger once predicted that ''New York's housing will become a massive and growing slum, if rent control is continued.''

 He was born in a brownstone on East 72d Street. His father, Myron Sulzberger, was a lawyer who served as a Municipal Court judge for 17 years.

 Mr. Sulzberger attended DeWitt Clinton High School and the Dwight School, and graduated in 1929 from Brown University, where he met his wife, the former Maye Dorfman, who attended Pembroke College.

 His first venture after graduation was a baking business. But an allergy to flour sent him into real estate, and by 1942 he was handling 50 buildings.

 Ten years later he acquired the company of Joseph H. Nassoit, changing its name in 1966 to Sulzberger-Rolfe. He joined his own name with that of his business partner and son-in-law, N. Anthony Rolfe, who succeeded him as president this year.

 Served on Housing Panel

 Mr. Sulzberger was appointed in 1982 by President Reagan to the board of directors of the National Corporation for Housing Partnerships. The board was created to increase the participation of private industry in the construction of housing for low- and moderate-income families.

 Mr. Sulzberger was a former president of the Metropolitan Fair Rent Committee and the Association for Government Assisted Housing, honorary chairman of the New York Rent Stabilization Committee and a member of the Realty Foundation of New York.

 He was a trustee of Tougaloo College in Jackson, Miss., and a former trustee of Brown University. He was active in more than 30 civic groups, including the boards of directors of Doctors Hospital, B'nai Brith, the United Jewish Appeal and the Flying Doctors in Kenya. In 1986, he established the Edward Sulzberger Foundation, a philanthropic fund.

 Mr. Sulzberger was an avid golfer and was a member and former president of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club in Scarsdale, N.Y. He also collected handmade figures of soldiers in English and Scottish regiments.

 In addition to his wife, he is survived by their daughter, Susan S. Rolfe, three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

 The cause of death was cancer, his family said.

 Dr. Anderson became Temple's president in 1967 as students on campuses across the nation were protesting the Vietnam War and demonstrating on behalf of civil rights.

 His own inauguration at the Philadelphia campus was disrupted when hundreds of students, many bearing signs, walked out. In 1970 he was criticized by Frank Rizzo, then the city's police commissioner and later its mayor, for offering meeting space at Temple for a national convention of the Black Panthers.

 Dr. Anderson weathered the tumult and was credited with guiding Temple through it. He retired in 1973.

 Teacher and Administrator

 In his career as a professor and administrator, he taught at MacMurray College for Women in Jacksonville, Ill.; Lake Erie College in Painesville, Ohio; Oberlin College in Ohio; American University in Lebanon, and Lawrence College in Appleton, Wis., where he was also a dean.

 In 1945 he was appointed president of the Pennsylvania College for Women, a Pittsburgh institution that was renamed Chatham College in 1955. In 1960 he became vice president for academic affairs at Temple.

 Dr. Anderson served as president of the Pennsylvania Association of Colleges and Universities and the Pennsylvania Foundation of Independent Colleges.

She was 82 and lived in Bellosguardo.

 Summing up her career last week, The Times of London said, ""As a writer, she had an eye for the romantic, the dramatic, the picturesque.""

 Miss Haslip's 1988 book, ""Marie Antoinette,"" about the French queen who was beheaded by revolutionaries in 1793, was praised in the United States as fully recognizing the queen's fascination while coolly detailing her many faults.

 That work was translated into 10 languages, as was Miss Haslip's 1965 book, ""The Lonely Empress: A Biography of Elizabeth of Austria,"" whose beautiful protagonist was assassinated in 1898. That volume was lauded by one American critic as humane and readable, and also vivid ""in conveying the effect of Elizabeth's looks.""

 Recreating Lost Worlds

 In an interview late in her life, Miss Haslip, who also wrote well-received biographies of men, said that in a good work of historical biography, ""a whole vanished world is brought back to life.""

 In that interview, she went on to observe about the writing of a biography, ""The whole venture follows the pattern of a love affair: initial infatuation, experience, disillusion, friendship, in that order!""

 Only one of her books is still in print: ""Madame Du Barry: The Wages of Beauty"" (Grove-Atlantic, 1992). Her other biographies of women included ""Catherine the Great"" (1977), ""Lucrezia Borgia"" (1954) and ""Lady Hester Stanhope"" (1936). And her biographies of men included ""Imperial Adventurer"" (1972), about the 19th-century Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, which was a Book-of-the-Month Club choice, and ""Parnell"" (1937) about Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th-century Irish nationalist leader. She also wrote novels.

 Miss Haslip grew up in England and Florence and was privately educated. She was on the staff of The London Mercury, a literary magazine, from 1929 to 1939 and was an editor at the BBC from 1941 to 1945.

 She was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

He was 87.

 The cause was not immediately made public.

 Mr. Singh, a Sikh from Punjab Province in northwestern India, was Foreign Minister from 1964 to 1966 and from 1970 to 1974.

 In 1971, he, his wife, the former Sardarni Charanjit Kaur, and their four daughters were living quietly in New Delhi. But he was thrust into the diplomatic limelight as spokesman for his country when India's support for East Pakistani secessionist guerrillas led to a brief war between his country and Pakistan, which India won.

 On Dec. 12, 1971, while the war went on, Mr. Singh addressed the United Nations Security Council for an hour and a half. An imposing turbaned figure, he said, over and over, that the root cause of the conflict was the ""brutal repression"" of the populace in East Pakistan by the Pakistani military Government and the forced flight of East Pakistani refugees to India.

 On Dec. 16, 1971, the secessionist leaders of Bangladesh, as they called their country, took over when the West Pakistani troops there surrendered to Indians who had seized the city of Dacca in support of the guerrillas' movement. At the United Nations, Mr. Singh called on the world to recognize ""the reality of Bangladesh.""

 He was a Cabinet minister continuously from 1952, when he joined Prime Minister Jawarharlal Nehru's Government, to 1975, when he left the Government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. As independent India's longest-serving Cabinet minister he held a variety of portfolios, ranging from railways to defense.

 He was born in the village of Shankar in what is now Punjab Province, studied physics and law in the city of Lahore, now in Pakistan, practiced law and then plunged into politics.

"The Rev. Jacob A. O.

Jacob A. O. Preus, whose insistence that the Bible is historical truth led to a schism in the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, died on Saturday in Burnsville, Minn., where he was visiting a daughter. He was 74 and lived in Webster Groves, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis.

 The cause was apparently a heart attack.

 Dr. Preus was president of the denomination, which has more than two million members, from 1969 to 1981. The synod was founded in 1847 by German immigrants. For a time, Dr. Preus (rhymes with ""voice"") was a controversial figure in American Protestantism who was known for his political savvy in carrying out the conservative retrenchment of the church. The split in the synod became an emblem of the broader battle between fundamentalists and liberals.

 Dr. Preus saw Bible stories, including that of Jonah and the whale, as historical truth, while many in the synod, including most of the faculty of Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, the synod's largest, regarded the stories as parables.

 Dr. Preus argued that those who dismissed the story of Jonah might eventually dismiss fundamental Christian tenets like the resurrection of Christ.

 He appointed a committee to investigate what he saw as liberalism at Concordia. In 1973, as a result of the committee's report, the majority of the faculty was accused of false teaching -- in effect, heresy.

 Most of the faculty boycotted classes to protest the removal of the seminary's moderate president. Ultimately, 100,000 members and 500 pastors left the Missouri Synod. The dissidents formed the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, which in 1988 merged with two other Lutheran groups to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

 Jacob Aall Ottensen Preus was born in St. Paul in 1920, a year before his father, Jake, was elected Governor of Minnesota. He graduated from Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, and the Luther Seminary in St. Paul and earned master's and doctoral degrees in the classics at the University of Minnesota.

 While he was president of the synod's Concordia Seminary in Springfield, Ill., in 1969, conservatives, angered by what they called the permissive trends in the synod, helped elect Dr. Preus president of the denomination.

 Dr. Preus is survived by his wife, the former Delpha Mae Hollecue; seven daughters, Patricia Bode of Glencoe, Mo., Delpha Harris of Edina, Minn., Carolin Misner of Mount Pleasant, Mich., Sarah Schwab of St. Charles, Mo., Idella Moberg of St. Cloud, Minn., Mary Churchill of Burnsville and Margaret Jones of Oklahoma City, and a son, the Rev.

 The cause of death was prostate cancer, said Marjorie Jarvis Hewlett, his wife of 51 years.

 In 1954 Dr. Hewlett, who was a pediatrician, became the first black physician on the staff of Jamaica Hospital at a time when blacks were allowed only courtesy privileges at Queens hospitals, said his wife. She said the hospital gave him staff privileges because he was light-skinned and could pass for white. Once on the staff, he successfully argued for other black physicians to gain similar privileges, she said.

 Dr. Hewlett was also the first black resident on the staff of Queens General Hospital and helped open a number of medical clinics in the Jamaica area.

"Senator John C. Stennis, a courtly Mississippi Democrat who served in the Senate longer than all but one other person in history, died today at St. Dominic-Jackson Memorial Hospital in Jackson, Miss.",5575,1995-04-24 00:00:00,"Senator John C. Stennis, a courtly Mississippi Democrat who served in the Senate longer than all but one other person in history, died today at St. Dominic-Jackson Memorial Hospital in Jackson, Miss. He was 93 years old.

 Mr. Stennis died of complications of pneumonia, said Rex Buffington, director of the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service at Mississippi State University in Starkville.

 When he retired on Jan. 3, 1989, Mr. Stennis had been in the Senate 41 years, 1 month and 29 days. Only Carl Hayden of Arizona, who retired in 1969 after 41 years and 10 months in the Senate, served longer.

 Although he was president pro tempore of the Senate, a largely honorary position given to the Senator in the majority party who has the most seniority, and was chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the 100th Congress, his role in his last years on Capitol Hill was largely that of patriarch and teacher to younger senators.

 He no longer dominated legislation as he had in the 1960's and 1970's, when he was the most influential voice in Congress on military affairs and when, widely respected for his integrity, diligence and judgment, he was called upon time and again to investigate touchy political matters, particularly those that had embarrassed the Senate. It became routine to refer to him as the conscience of the entire institution.

 In many respects, John Stennis was the last of the Senate's Southern barons -- Democrats elected from one-party states who gained power through seniority and often wielded it autocratically to block the more liberal initiatives of the senators from the rest of the country. His support for the military was unswerving, and his advocacy of racial segregation was unalloyed for most of his career.

 But in style and temperament, Senator Stennis was cut from a mold different from most of the other Southerners who came to power shortly after World War II. He did not drink, smoke, swear in public or use racial epithets. Perhaps more important, he changed with the times, began supporting some civil rights measures, and, in his last elections, he ran well among black voters.

 His colleagues from outside the South did not fear him so much as they liked and admired him. At the height of one of the battles over civil rights legislation that occupied the Senate in the 1960's, Senator Paul H. Douglas, Democrat of Illinois, a leader of the faction supporting the measure, declared, ""If I were ever to have to go on trial, I would want John Stennis to be my judge.""

 It was his personal qualities that led Senator Stennis's colleagues to choose him so often to head political inquiries. As early as 1954, when he was a junior senator, he was named to the committee that investigated charges against Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican of Wisconsin.

 Eight years later, he was put in charge of an investigation of accusations that the Pentagon was muzzling officers who wanted to speak up against Communism. In 1967, he headed the investigation of Senator Thomas J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, that led to Senator Dodd's censure for misuse of funds and to a new code of ethics for the Senate.

 In 1973, President Richard M. Nixon took advantage of Senator Stennis's reputation for integrity and proposed that, instead of turning over the Watergate tapes to the independent prosecutor, he allow the Senator to listen to them and authenticate summaries prepared by the White House.

 Mr. Stennis at first agreed. But when the prosecutor, Archibald Cox, objected to the suggestion and was discharged for his defiance, the Stennis compromise collapsed.

 Mr. Stennis was chairman of the Armed Services Committee at the height of the Vietnam War, and President Nixon relied on him to defend the Administration against countless end-the-war amendments and efforts to cut the Pentagon's budget. More often than not, Mr. Stennis was successful, despite opposition by most of his fellow Democrats.

 Later, when President Jimmy Carter rejected some of the Pentagon's spending requests, Senator Stennis tried to accommodate him, although, personally, he would have preferred a larger military budget.

 Years later, the Senator said in an interview that he never tried to second-guess a President on foreign policy and military matters.

 ""I lean with the President on our system of government,"" he declared, expressing a view that many modern senators consider old-fashioned. ""Makes no difference who he is. I would back those fellows on a lot of things.""

 While he often counseled young senators and helped them through the parliamentary maze that the Senate, over time, has constructed for itself, Mr. Stennis in his later years seemed to long for the days when junior senators bided their time and held their tongues.

 ""I'm not blaming them,"" he once said of his younger colleagues. ""They come here on the average well-educated. But they don't have the maturity, if I may use that term. They don't have the experience in public affairs that the old-timer had. It takes time to mature.""

 John Cornelius Stennis was born on Aug. 3, 1901, in Kemper County in the red clay hills of eastern Mississippi. He was a member of one of the leading families in the rural county. His father was a farmer, but the Stennises were known as professional people -- doctors, lawyers, teachers and legislators.

 John C. Stennis graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Mississippi State University in 1923 and, four years later, received his law degree at the University of Virginia. A year out of law school, he was elected to the Mississippi Legislature, and that was followed by elections as district prosecuting attorney and circuit judge.

 After 10 years on the bench, he ran in 1947 for the Senate seat vacated by the death of the flamboyant Senator Theodore G. Bilbo and was elected that November over five opponents. ""I want to plow a straight furrow right down to the end of my row,"" Mr. Stennis asserted in that campaign. The philosophy seems to have guided the rest of his political career.

 Until his last campaign, in 1982, he was never seriously challenged for re-election, and even then, facing a 34-year-old Republican, Haley Barbour, who made the Senator's advanced age a major issue, Mr. Stennis won by about 2 to 1.

 In his early days in the Senate, he worked 16 hours a day, staying in the Senate until it adjourned and then studying in the Library of Congress until it closed. He was, as an aide described him, ""a plodder, a guy who would go over something once and then again and then again until he finally understood all the complexities.""

 Asked once what his hobby was, Mr. Stennis said, ""My work is my play and my play is my work."" That work often paid off in the currency of special projects for his constituents. The Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, a massive public works project that opened in Mississippi in 1985, is his pyramid.

 Few other senators had such a commanding presence as Mr. Stennis did in his heyday. When he stood on the floor to speak, he would start by snapping his fingers, making a sound that could be heard in every corner of the chamber, and a page would come scurrying with a glass of water.

 Then, his throat cleared, he would rise behind the lectern on his desk at the rear of the chamber, and a hush would fall over the Senate. His speeches resembled lectures. He would not tolerate interruptions, often pointing his finger and making a ""shush"" sound when another senator tried to speak.

 He paced up and down the center aisle as he talked, with such resonance that, even after microphones were installed in the Senate, he often spoke without one.

 His voice remained clear and his mind sharp as he grew older, but he had serious physical problems. He was shot and seriously wounded by a burglar at his home in 1973, and his left leg was amputated in 1984 because of cancer. But each time, he returned to his Senate work much sooner than expected.

 But the injury and the illness took their toll. After he lost his leg, bars were constructed on his desk in the Senate chamber so he could pull himself out of his wheelchair and stand when he delivered one of his rare speeches on the floor.

 Mr. Stennis's friends said he suffered from extreme loneliness after his wife, the former Coy Hines, whom he called ""Miss Coy,"" died in 1983. They had been married more than 50 years.

 After his retirement, Mr. Stennis moved to the Mississippi State University campus at Starkville, the home of the John C. Stennis Institute of Government and the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service, created by Congress to train young leaders Also named for him is NASA's National Space Technology Laboratory near Bay St. Louis, Miss. The John C. Stennis Space Center tests rocket motors. The nation's newest aircraft carrier was christened the John C. Stennis and is scheduled to be commissioned next December.

 ""I do believe the most important thing I can do now is to help young people understand the past and prepare for the future,"" Mr. Stennis said in a 1990 interview while serving as executive-in-residence at Mississippi State.

 In declining health, Mr. Stennis lived in recent years in a nursing home in Madison, near Jackson. He is survived by two children, Margaret Womble, of Winston-Salem, N.C., and John H. Stennis, of Jackson, Miss.

 Mr. Buffington said Mr. Stennis's body will lie in state at the Old Capitol in Jackson on Tuesday from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M., and then at DeKalb Presbyterian Church in DeKalb from 4 to 6 P.M. Graveside services are to be held at the DeKalb Cemetery on Wednesday at 11 A.M.","April 24, 1995, Monday, Late Edition - Final  John C.

Cheadle, a former Chancellor of the University of California at Santa Barbara whose 15-year tenure was marked by rapid campus growth as well as student unrest, died on Sunday at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara. He was 85.

 Dr. Cheadle, who lived in Santa Barbara, was an internationally known botanist. He was Chancellor from 1962 to 1977. In that time, the number of disciplines taught on the campus rose to 100 from 36, master's programs to 42 from 15, and Ph.D. programs to 27 from 2. Enrollment grew to more than 12,000 from 4,700.

 Student unrest over civil rights, the Vietnam War and a feeling of powerlessness against political and economic institutions swirled around Dr. Cheadle when he was Chancellor. In 1969, members of the Black Students Union occupied a campus building and pressured the administation into creating a black studies program.

 In February 1970, youths battled the police for three nights in Isla Vista, a college town of about 13,000 people, including 9,000 students, adjacent to the Santa Barbara campus. The violence left 1 student dead and more than 100 injured or arrested, and resulted in the destruction of several buildings, including a bank that was burned to the ground. The violence ended after Ronald Reagan, then Governor of California, declared an ""extreme emergency"" and called in the National Guard.

 After his retirement Dr. Cheadle returned to his botany laboratory, where he studied water-conducting cells in higher forms of plant life, like corn and grasses. His specialty was the morphology of vascular plants.

 Vernon Irving Cheadle was born in Salem, S. D., and received a bachelor's degree from Miami University in Ohio in 1932 and a master's degree and Ph.D. in botany from Harvard University.

 He taught at Harvard and Rhode Island State College before joining the University of California at Davis as chairman of the botany department in 1952. He was acting vice chancellor at Davis when Santa Barbara named him as Chancellor.

"Robert H. Finch, who managed Richard Nixon's 1960 Presidential campaign and later served as his Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, died of a heart attack today.",51631,1995-10-11 00:00:00,"Robert H. Finch, who managed Richard Nixon's 1960 Presidential campaign and later served as his Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, died of a heart attack today. He was 70.

 After managing Mr. Nixon's unsuccessful 1960 Presidential campaign, Mr. Finch served from 1967 to 1969 as Lieutenant Governor of California and then became H.E.W. Secretary in the first Nixon cabinet, in 1969.

 Mr. Finch later became Presidential counselor, but he left the Nixon Administration and returned to Southern California to practice law, disappointed that he had been frozen out of Mr. Nixon's inner circle by H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and others who later became central figures in the Watergate scandal.

 Mr. Finch was never implicated in the scandal, but his close association with Mr. Nixon effectively ended his political career. He sought the Republican nomination for the Senate in 1976, but lost the primary to S. I. Hayakawa.

 Mr. Finch ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1952 and 1954. In 1956, he was elected chairman of the Los Angeles County Republican Central Committee.

 In 1958, he became administrative assistant to Mr. Nixon, who was then Vice President, and went on to manage Mr. Nixon's 1960 campaign for President, which he lost to John F. Kennedy.

 Mr. Finch recommended against Mr. Nixon undertaking his ill-fated 1962 campaign for Governor of California, but Mr. Finch was a loyal aide once Mr. Nixon entered the race. In 1964, he directed the actor George Murphy's successful campaign for the United States Senate.

 Two years later, Mr. Finch ran for Lieutenant Governor and was swept into office in the Republican tide led by Ronald Reagan, who won the Governorship.

 A pragmatic middle-of-the-road Republican, Mr. Finch was not close to the conservative Mr. Reagan, and he eagerly accepted Mr. Nixon's bid to join his cabinet in 1969, resigning halfway through his four-year term as Lieutenant Governor.

 His political star started to dim immediately. He was widely criticized as an ineffective H.E.W. Secretary and was eased out of that high-profile post with the appointment as Presidential counselor, where he was overshadowed by Mr. Haldeman and Mr. Ehrlichman.

 Although Mr. Finch was never involved in the Watergate scandal -- having been frozen out of the inner circle before it began -- his reputation was nonetheless tarnished.

 ""I couldn't run for dogcatcher without it turning into a referendum on Watergate,"" he said in a 1974 interview. ""But at least I don't have any trouble sleeping at night.""

 Mr. Finch married the former Carol Crothers in 1946. They had four children, Maureen, Kevin, Priscella and Cathleen.","October 11, 1995, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final  Robert H. Finch, 70, Nixon Aide And Former Cabinet Secretary"
"the Spanish Foreign Minister today as its next secretary general, ending six weeks of wrangling in which the allies publicly quarreled over two other leading candidates.",25887,1995-12-02 00:00:00,"NATO chose the Spanish Foreign Minister today as its next secretary general, ending six weeks of wrangling in which the allies publicly quarreled over two other leading candidates.

 The Spaniard, Javier Solana, a 53-year-old Socialist, is expected to be formally appointed next week and will immediately assume the challenge of having to supervise NATO's impending peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the alliance's largest operation to date, with 60,000 troops.

 In Brussels today, NATO envoys approved sending 2,600 troops to Bosnia to prepare for the larger force.

 Mr. Solana will also oversee the delicate expansion process of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization as it prepares to take in new members from central Europe.

 He will succeed Willy Claes of Belgium, who was forced to resign on Oct. 20 to face charges in an arms-buying scandal while he served in his country's Cabinet.

 Diplomats see the post of NATO secretary general as crucial, requiring a skillful manager and leader who can influence the alliance's direction and debates and act as a consensus builder among bickering and sometimes jealous allies.

 Agreeing on the next secretary general, normally a confidential process, has been particularly public and troublesome.

 The United States last month vetoed the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Ruud Lubbers, even though by then he had the open backing of six nations, including Britain and France. The veto angered his supporters, especially the Dutch, because Mr. Lubbers, while in office, had taken on the highly unpopular task of defending the placement of American missiles on Dutch soil.

 The real reason for the rebuff, diplomats said, was that Washington was annoyed because it felt it had not been properly consulted on his candidacy and refused to accept a fait accompli.

 France, in turn, blocked the candidate acceptable to Washington, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, a former Foreign Minister of Denmark. French officials said that the Danish candidate's knowledge of French -- one of the two official languages -- was not good enough, and, moreover, he had openly criticized French nuclear tests being conducted in the Pacific.

 Mr. Solana was drafted in recent weeks as a compromise. The secretary general's job has traditionally gone to a European and the top military job to an American general.

 Mr. Solana is a physicist who keeps up with solid-state physics in his spare time. Before he became Foreign Minister, he was Minister of Culture and Minister of Education. A militant Socialist in his youth, he opposed the presence of American military bases in Spain and his country's membership in NATO.

 A cordial, outgoing man, he is now a keen believer in the need for a strong Atlantic alliance and has championed a ""European solution"" to the conflict in Bosnia. During a recent conversation, he said he and Secretary of State Warren Christopher had discussed their concern that the special Atlantic relationship should not drift apart.

 Noting that Spain is the only NATO member that confirmed its membership with a national referendum, he said, ""Spain is Europe's most committed member of NATO.""

 Mr. Solana's departure to NATO headquarters in Brussels will deeply affect Spanish politics. A close friend of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, he was believed to be Mr. Gonzalez's likely successor as head of the Socialist Party and its candidate if the Spanish leader decides not to run in elections in March.

 --------------------

 Senators Oppose Appointment

 WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (By The New York Times) -- Just hours after the selection of Foreign Minister Solana as NATO chief, signs of opposition appeared on Capitol Hill today.

 Several Republican Senators -- Bob Dole, Jesse Helms, John McCain, Paul Coverdell, Strom Thurmond and Olympia Snowe -- signed a letter to President Clinton opposing the nomination, calling him ""a dedicated Socialist with an extensive public record in opposition to NATO.""

 The letter added, ""With troops poised to enter Bosnia to enforce the recent peace agreement, NATO can ill afford to be led by a candidate whose credentials are in question.""

 The Senate has no power to block the appointment, but the senators are opposing it as Mr. Clinton is trying to get the maximum support for his troop deployment to Bosnia.","December 2, 1995, Saturday, Late Edition - Final  NATO Picks Spanish Foreign Minister for Secretary General"

 Mr. Pogue completed his epic study in 1987 after 30 years of labor and the review of 3.5 million pages of research material. Viking Press published ""George C.

 A pioneer of oral-history techniques, Mr. Pogue recorded some 40 hours of interviews with Marshall himself and encounters with more than 300 people who had known him, many of them prominent figures themselves.

 Born in Eddyville, Ky., Mr. Pogue graduated from Murray State University at the age of 19 and earned a master's degree at the University of Kentucky and a Ph.D. from Clark University. He joined the Murray State history faculty in 1933.

 In World War II, he served in the Army as a combat historian and accompanied the troops at the D-Day invasion and across much of Europe.

 Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower assigned him to write the official chronicle of the Eisenhower command in Europe, which prompted Mr. Pogue's first book, ""The Supreme Command"" (1954). He wrote numerous articles and essays and contributed to several books, including ""The Meaning of Yalta"" (1956), a collection of essays on that wartime conference.

"Andreas Papandreou, the former Prime Minister of Greece and a maverick who towered over Greek political life for more than two decades, died early today at his home in Athens.",35396,1996-06-23 00:00:00,"Andreas Papandreou, the former Prime Minister of Greece and a maverick who towered over Greek political life for more than two decades, died early today at his home in Athens. He was 77.

 The cause was a heart attack, his doctors said in a statement. Mr. Papandreou had open-heart surgery in 1988, though that did not keep him from winning an election in 1993.

 But during 1995, his failing health prevented him from performing his dutiesm leaving Greece flailing. Yet even as his fiery voice had thinned to a near whisper and he walked with great difficulty, Mr. Papandreou refused to step aside or name a deputy to run the Government.

 Finally, in January, his Socialist Party named Costas Simitis Prime Minister, and Mr. Papandreou had not been seen in public since his release from a hospital on March 21.

 Few other politicians in modern Greece have inspired as much love and loathing at home and as much bewilderment and irritation abroad. The tall figure with bushy eyebrows fascinated Greeks with his compelling oratory and his unpredictable and volatile ways, and he remained hard to fathom even for his friends.

 He was successful at home because he appealed to Greece's thirst for change, and his nationalist polemics appealed to the Greeks' perennial feeling of being misunderstood and unappreciated.

 Abroad, Greece's Western allies were regularly befuddled as the undoctrinaire Socialist took positions diametrically opposed to theirs on issues ranging from Serbian aggression in Bosnia to the role of NATO.

 Above all, the United States loomed large in his life, for that was where he had served in the Navy, graduated from college, worked, married twice and had four children; it was his source of funds and the nation that he first admired and later railed against obsessively.

 The core of his foreign policy was to end Greece's status as ""a client state of the West."" As a result, he refused to condemn the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and variously threatened to pull out of NATO, the United Nations and the European Union, although he accepted the Union's generous funds.

 He blocked European credits for Turkey, Greece's enemy. While others shunned Libya and Yugoslavia, he improved his ties there. In the Bosnian war he supported Serbia, a longtime ally, and opposed sanctions against Serbia. He was reluctant to condemn Serbian atrocities, even in the face of ample evidence.

 Mr. Papandreou thrived on being contrary; he described this as ""tightrope diplomacy."" Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was especially skillful at extracting funds from fearful Western governments that wanted to protect Europe's southeastern flank in the Communist Balkans. But despite his polemics, he remained pro-Western.

 Although he was always passionate about politics, his life was made up of very distinct parts.

 The only son of Sophia and George Papandreou, Andreas George Papandreou was born on Feb. 5, 1919, on Chios, while his father served as governor general of the Aegean Islands. When Andreas was five, his parents divorced. But he stayed in touch with his father, who rose in politics and became a powerful and popular leader, eventually becoming Prime Minister.

 In 1937, when Andreas entered Athens University Law School, Greece was ruled by a right-wing dictator, Gen. Ioannis Metaxas, and his father and other liberals were banished to the island of Andros. Andreas, by now a Trotskyist, joined a resistance group that distributed underground newspapers and pamphlets, for which he was arrested and tortured.

 Shortly before Mussolini's troops entered Greece, Andreas Papandreou left for New York, where he arrived in May 1940 with $14 in his pocket. He enrolled at Columbia University and took odd jobs to support himself. He married a Greek-American, Christine Rassias, in 1941 and earned a doctorate in economics at Harvard University in 1943.

 The marriage ended in divorce a decade later. Dr. Rassias, a psychiatrist, said she often felt bullied by her husband, that he was a ""ruffian"" and ""lied all the time."" She wrote an unpublished autobiography in which she described Mr. Papandreou as cruel and dishonest.

 In an interview last year, Dr. Rassias was asked why the book had not been published. Speaking of Mr. Papandreou, she said: ""He paid me $90,000 not to publish the book because he was running for office then. He was afraid it would damage his political chances."" She accepted. ""I needed the money,"" she said.

 After becoming an American citizen, Mr. Papandreou joined the Navy for two years of wartime service, much of which he spent as a clerk in the Bethesda Naval Hospital. When World War II ended, he started his career as a lecturer in economics, first at Harvard, then at the University of Minnesota and Northwestern University. He eventually became a professor and the chairman of the department of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, until he resigned in 1963.

 Meanwhile he had met Margaret Chant, of Elmhurst, Ill., a former journalism student. After both obtained divorces, they were married in Nevada in 1951. They settled down in Berkeley, raised three sons and a daughter and became actively involved in liberal American politics.

 It was with the help of American funds that Mr. Papandreou returned to Greece. Supported by Guggenheim and Fulbright grants, he spent 1959 studying the Greek economy. He went to Athens again in 1961 to set up the Center for Economic Research, this time with financing from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.

 He handed back his American citizenship in 1964 to run for Parliament under the auspices of his father, the Prime Minister. Later that year his father named him Deputy Minister of Economics.

 But King Constantine, who distrusted both men, dismissed the Prime Minister and his Cabinet. The period of instability that followed led to a right-wing military coup in 1967, and both Papandreous were arrested. The younger man was kept in solitary confinement for eight months.

 Again the United States loomed large. Pressure from influential Americans, including the economist John Kenneth Galbraith, led the military junta to release Andreas Papandreou and other political prisoners in 1967. But from his exile, first in Sweden, then in Canada, Mr. Papandreou organized a coalition of opposition groups and denounced the American Government for ""complicity"" in the military coup. He remained convinced that Washington quietly supported the 1968-74 military dictatorship.

 In a 1972 article in The New York Times, he wrote that the United States approved prime ministers, interfered in elections and in military promotions and ""controlled the Greek Intelligence Service.""

 In 1974, when Greece was traumatized by Turkey's invasion of Northern Cyprus, he and many others were convinced once again that Washington knew about the Turkish military plans and could have stopped them. The belief that in general Washington favored Turkey over Greece in their perennial squabbling fed more anti-Americanism.

 The party he founded in 1974, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or Pasok, changed Greece's political landscape. It brought him -- and the left -- to power in 1981. Describing himself as a ""non-dogmatic Marxist"" he quickly introduced social reforms that benefited low-income groups, promoted workers' councils and farmers' cooperatives, abolished censorship and lowered the voting age to 18; prompted by his American wife, he brought legal equality for women.

 As soon as he took office after the 1981 elections, Mr. Papandreou tweaked the West by opening a Greek Embassy in Cuba and granting diplomatic status to the Palestine Liberation Organization.

 Behind his neutralist gestures, Mr. Papandreou's foreign policy was cautious, almost conservative. He kept Greece in NATO, but refused to take part in some exercises. He preserved Greece's membership in the European Union, thus obtaining important agricultural subsidies. But he also gave Washington what it had not been able to obtain from his right-wing predecessor: a five-year renewable agreement to retain four military bases and a number of smaller installations on Greek soil.

 At home, many Greeks applauded him because he established civil marriage and legalized divorce and abortion. But his economic policy remained so full of contradictions that no one quite knew where he stood, and critics said that he squandered the power and the funds he had to modernize the country.

 For all his calls for change and the generous funds from the European Union, Greece remains the Union's poorest nation. Of the $12 billion the Community lent Mr. Papandreou in the 1980's to modernize, diplomats in Brussels said, 80 percent was spent on consumption and salaries for political featherbedding.

 As opposition leader and as Prime Minister, he lashed out against the corruption of his predecessors, but his own government unraveled in the late 80's in a series of scandals involving fraud and phone-tapping.

 His prestige also suffered because he publicly flaunted his affair with Dimitra Liani, a flight attendant half his age, while he was still married to his wife of 38 years. After humiliating publicity, Margaret Papandreou, the mother of his four adult children, agreed to a divorce in 1989.

 By late 1989, he could no longer withstand the cascade of scandals and he lost the elections. Parliament indicted Mr. Papandreou and ordered him and four of his former ministers to stand trial on charges including bribery and embezzlement. He repeatedly protested his innocence, saying that American agents were trying to ""destabilize"" Greece and that his political opponents were out to destroy him politically.

 Mr. Papandreou was narrowly acquitted in 1992, but two of his ministers were convicted.

 Yet on Oct. 10, 1993, Mr. Papandreou made an astonishing comeback. Even though he had had a heart operation; taken Ms. Liani, his mistress, as his third wife; built a mansion costing more than $1 million, and never quite shaken off corruption charges, he won election for the third time.

 This was perhaps his most remarkable trait, the ability to change position and survive scandal and even indictment without loosing popularity.

 ""He was an amazing politician,"" said Nicholas Gage, author of several books on Greece and a former New York Times correspondent there. ""He made ordinary people feel they mattered. Above all he was a master at tapping the mood of the moment and at adapting his views to that. Basically, he was politically amoral.""

 Behind his charm, there was also a man known for being autocratic and wanting total control.

 Epiminondas Zafiropoulos, an opponent and member of the 1989 parliamentary investigation into Mr. Papandreou's conduct, said the leader was essentially ""an insecure man"" who ""wanted to be the master of all the games.""

 During his 10 years in office, he modernized Greece, but not enough to pull it from the doldrums. Rather than cutting back the country's enormous and rigid bureaucracy, he bloated to capture votes. Although Mr. Papandreou inherited a patronage system where a politician is expected to provide a job for every supporter, many economists agree that he did little to change this; some say he expanded it.

 Some of Mr. Papandreou's supporters believe that his successes and his strong leadership in balancing an unruly society have been unfairly overshadowed by his governments' financial scandals and by troubles involving his wives.

 Although extra-marital affairs are common in Greek politics, Mr. Papandreou broke the rules by publicly displaying his liaison with Ms. Liani. Greek women, in particular, did not pardon this affront to his wife, a strong voice for social reform and women's rights.

 In 1995, he was relentlessly criticized by supporters and opponents for naming his new wife director of his office and giving her much power over access to him. He caused further outcry by saying he would support her if she had political ambitions.

 The fallout was intense. One result was that his longtime ally, George Kouris, publisher of the newspaper Avriani, staged a smear campaign and regularly published nude pictures of a young Ms. Liani, hoping to undermine the Prime Minister and to block Ms. Liani's political career.

 Last year, friends said, even as his health was waning, Mr. Papandreou aspired to become President -- a largely ceremonial post -- when Constantine Karamanlis's term expired in May. But the struggle to succeed Mr. Papandreou as party and Government leader was so fierce that he reportedly feared a breakup of the party and renounced his aspiration.

 Over the years, he published a number of articles and books on economic and political themes, including the succesful ""Democracy at Gunpoint"" and ""Paternalistic Capitalism.""

 In addition to his wife, Ms. Liani, he is survived by his four children from his second marriage, to Margaret Chant: George, who is Greece's Minister of Education, Sophia, Nicholas and Andreas.","June 23, 1996, Sunday, Late Edition - Final  Andreas Papandreou Dies at 77; Fiery, Ambiguous Premier Dominated Greek Politics"

Burt, a thoracic surgeon who was president of the medical staff at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, died on Oct. 4 in Southampton, N.Y. He was 49 and lived in Manhattan.

 He was killed in a motorcycle accident. The police said he apparently lost control of his motorcycle and struck a telephone pole.

 After 12 years at the hospital, Dr. Burt was elected president of the medical staff in April. As president, he represented the staff in policy-making. At the same time, the hospital named him to the Alfred P. Sloan Chair in surgery.

 Earlier in his career, at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., Dr. Burt found ways to use nutrition to starve a tumor while maintaining the body's health.

 Dr. Burt's later research was intended to stop the spread, or metastasis, of cancer in the lung.

 The blood to the lung was isolated from the rest of the body during surgery, and an anticancer drug was given directly to the lung to attack tumor cells there while sparing the body's healthy tissues.

 Dr. Burt was born in Newark, and he received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Rutgers in 1970. He attended Cornell Medical School and received his M.D. from St. Louis University School of Medicine in 1975 and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from George Washington University in 1981.

 He joined the staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering in 1985. He was an associate professor of biochemistry and surgery at Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan.

 Father Burke was ordained a priest in 1941 and began teaching English at St. John's five years later. He stayed at the university for nine years before joining the faculty at Niagara University, for a time serving as chairman of the English department.

 In 1959, he returned to St. John's as dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences in a position that included jurisdiction over University College in Brooklyn. During his tenure as dean, he oversaw the integration of the two campuses.

 In 1961, he became the 13th president at St. John's, taking over at a time when the faculty was beginning to demand a larger role in policy decisions and the students were eager to join in the trend then sweeping the nation's secular and religious campuses toward more autonomy in student publications and other activities.

 Father Burke returned to Niagara in 1965 and taught 19th-century English literature. He was named professor emeritus upon his retirement in August 1985.

 He was a 1936 philosophy graduate of St. Joseph's College in Princeton, N.J., and he received a master's degree and doctorate in English studies from St. John's in 1947 and 1955.

He was 69.

 Radio Trinidad, quoting hospital officials, said Mr. Chambers died of a heart attack.

 He served as Prime Minister for one term between 1981 and 1986 after the death of the country's first Prime Minister, Eric Williams.

 He won the 1981 general election comfortably, coming to the position with a long background in government. He was first elected to Parliament in 1966 and later held various Cabinet portfolios including finance, industry, education and agriculture.

 But he lost public favor as oil prices slumped and the economy contracted and his party, the People's National Movement, was defeated in the 1986 election. Mr. Chambers lost his Parliament seat in that election.

 He was remembered as a quiet, humble man who made difficult economic decisions that laid a foundation for Trinidad's later economic strength.

 ""He was a very private person, but he was always available to anyone who wanted a word of advice,"" Linda Baboolal, chairwoman of the People's National Movement, said.

"Cardboard boxes clutter the floor of Dr. Mary Hibberd's office here, some filled with files to discard and others bulging with mementos to keep.",22006,1997-06-13 00:00:00,"Cardboard boxes clutter the floor of Dr. Mary Hibberd's office here, some filled with files to discard and others bulging with mementos to keep. Her desk is strewn with folders and a hammer and a screwdriver for removing photos from the wood-paneled wall.

 Dr. Hibberd, the Suffolk County Health Commissioner, is making an abrupt and highly publicized career change in a life that has never worked out quite the way she planned.

 Her pattern was set early, when hopes of becoming a naturalist were thwarted by a graduate program's males-only policy. Since then, her zigzag career as a scientist and pediatrician has taken her to a remote Montana Indian reservation, the squalor of Bangladesh and the poorest neighborhoods of Long Island.

 None of it seemed to prepare Dr. Hibberd for the rough and tumble of politics in Suffolk County. She says she was ousted because she would not play patronage games; her detractors disputed her health policies and said she was a poor manager. In any case, by Friday, she will have vacated her office.

 As Dr. Hibberd sorted through her things, she said, ""Look -- here's something."" It was the plaque commemorating her induction in March into the Suffolk County Women's Hall of Fame. Etched at the bottom is the name of County Executive Robert J. Gaffney -- who two months later, without warning, created a committee to search for her successor.

 Dr. Hibberd was in Virginia picking up her daughter from college, and found out when she called her answering machine from a pay phone in a Wendy's and heard urgent messages from reporters.

 ""It was very painful,"" she recalled. ""I was crying and saying it's not fair -- I'm not there to defend myself. We drove back home in this big line of violent thunderstorms. It seemed like the perfect metaphor.""

 Mr. Gaffney said his decision stemmed from a growing rift with Dr. Hibberd over health policies. He also questioned her management skills, saying that her agency had failed to get millions of dollars in state aid, that malpractice expenses were high and that its managed-care system was floundering.

 Dr. Hibberd rebutted his complaints, saying, for example, that Suffolk would get all its state aid after the normal lags in claims, payments and budget cycles. But she also mounted a counterattack, saying that the real reason for her removal was that she blocked attempts at interference by Mr. Gaffney, his top aides, two legislators and others.

 Over the years, she said, those officials had tried to foist unqualified but politically connected job candidates on her agency. She said they also tried to force her agency to spend money advertising in a politically connected newspaper and tried to strong-arm her into backing off on smoking regulations to help their business friends.

 Dr. Hibberd, 50, a divorced mother of two who is given to quoting Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said she would not give in. ""My duty is to protect the public health, not to engage in politics,"" she said.

 Nor did she seem concerned about losing her job. ""I always think God has a plan, even though we don't know it,"" she said.

 Dr. Hibberd has a legion of admirers who see her as a Mother Teresa who championed suburbia's invisible needy, and, in the process, cut Suffolk's infant mortality rate by more than 40 percent.

 ""Mary is credible, and the rest of them aren't,"" said Maxine Postal, a Democrat and chairwoman of the County Legislature's Health Committee. ""That slim woman has a backbone made of tempered steel. From the person who does the maintenance work right up to the top, they say she's the very best we've ever had.""

 Mr. Gaffney and the other officials denied the charges of interference. Mr. Gaffney declined to be interviewed for this article.

 Although some people called for an investigation get to the bottom of the dispute, there appears little chance of that. Instead, Dr. Hibberd will start a new job Monday as a senior executive at Ipro, a health-care consulting firm in Lake Success.

 Growing up in Upper Darby, Pa., Dr. Hibberd never envisioned that she would some day be at the helm of a $275 million-a-year health agency.

 ""It was actually a fluky thing,"" Dr. Hibberd said of her career. Her own requirement was to find something ""that was work I wanted to do and that made a difference."" After being shut out of the naturalists' program, she earned a master's degree in microbial genetics, then another in human genetics, which led her into medicine.

 ""I liked surgery best, but women rarely went into that,"" she said, so she shifted to pediatrics. In nearly five years practicing at the Flathead Indian reservation, she realized the medical toll of social and economic ills. ""I saw a lot of unemployment, alcoholism, fetal alcohol syndrome.""

 Her career was transformed again by 10 months as a volunteer in the Care Medico program in Bangladesh. ""People went blind from lack of vitamin A. There was scurvy, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, TB -- all preventable. You could save thousands.""

 She earned a master's degree in public health and took a residency in community and preventive health at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. A stint at the Suffolk Health Department prompted a job offer, and she became director of reproductive care for six years. County Executive Patrick Halpin named her acting health commissioner in 1991, and Mr. Gaffney made the appointment permanent.

 Many trace her undoing to a dispute four years ago with Suffolk's District Attorney, James Catterson Jr.

 She accused Mr. Catterson of threatening to investigate her agency unless she overturned the failing results of a psychological exam given to a son of a longtime associate of his. The son, an investigator in Mr. Catterson's office, needed to pass for authorization to carry a gun.

 Perhaps emboldened by Dr. Hibberd, other Republican officials also began to speak out, saying that Mr. Catterson had improperly pressured them on various issues. But he denied all the complaints, and a state inquiry ended with no action taken against him.

 ""There's a pattern here of someone who sees things that other people don't,"" Mr. Catterson said in an interview. ""I've never understood her agenda."" He said Dr. Hibberd had been ""canonized"" by the news media, but he conceded, ""She comes across in private as she does in public, as Mother Teresa, and it's very disarming.""

 Her tenacity, however, hardly ingratiated her with Mr. Gaffney. This year she went over his head to the County Legislature to win more funds for her department.

 About the last thing to come down from Dr. Hibberd's office wall was a display of 13 color snapshots of beaming mothers and their babies from Project Hope, in which health workers monitor infants through their critical first year.

 ""This is one of the programs I started and one of the best things in the department,"" she said. ""So I am definitely taking these pictures. It just makes you feel good.""","June 13, 1997, Friday, Late Edition - Final  Bounced Commissioner Practices Her Rebound"

"Vu Van Mau, who was briefly South Vietnam's Prime Minister -- and who called for all Americans to leave Saigon just before it fell to the Communist forces in 1975 -- died on Aug. 20 in a hospital in Paris.",40890,1998-09-14 00:00:00,"Vu Van Mau, who was briefly South Vietnam's Prime Minister -- and who called for all Americans to leave Saigon just before it fell to the Communist forces in 1975 -- died on Aug. 20 in a hospital in Paris. He was 84.

 He emigrated from Vietnam to France in 1988, Le Monde said in reporting his death on Saturday. He died of natural causes, said his son Dung Vu Hoang, according to The Associated Press.

 Vu Van Mau was a Buddhist politician who was an advocate of nonviolence, and president of Forces for Reconciliation, a South Vietnamese pacifist party. He was named Prime Minister by Gen. Duong Van Minh, a South Vietnamese proponent of peace, neutrality and cooperation with the Vietnamese Communists, in the last days before the Communists achieved victory in the Vietnam War.

 General Minh became President after a Vietcong broadcast on April 24 strongly implied that only he was acceptable to them at the head of the Saigon Government.

 At the time of the broadcast, while North Vietnam and the Vietcong had not declared that they would attack Saigon if their demands were not met, there was no doubt among Saigon's residents that the Communists were likely to attack soon -- and military and political leaders expected that the outcome would be shattering. The Vietcong had been calling for the departure of the incumbent South Vietnamese President, Tran Van Huong, along with political associates of his and all ""American troops and military advisers disguised as civilians.""

 In the days after the Vietcong broadcast, the departure of Americans and some South Vietnamese progressed, President Ford ordered the emergency evacuation of all Americans from South Vietnam, Communist attacks continued around Saigon and a rocket barrage hit the city's airport.

 On April 29, General Minh, meeting with an American officer, insisted only on the prompt withdrawal of the staff of the United States Defense Attache's office, Frank Snepp, a former C.I.A. official in Vietnam, wrote in his book ""Decent Interval: An Insider's Account of Saigon's Indecent End"" (1977).

 But not more than an hour later, Mr. Snepp wrote, Saigon Radio broadcast ""an appeal from the new Prime Minister, Vu Van Mau, calling on all Americans to leave Saigon at once."" Mr. Snepp wrote that by means of that broadcast, it seemed, President Minh ""was angling for maximum political advantage with the Communists by closing the door on us all.""

 Late in the day of April 29, the United States put an end to decades of military involvement in Vietnam by evacuating about 1,000 Americans and more than 5,000 South Vietnamese from Saigon. On the following day, North Vietnamese troops marched into the capital.

 North Vietnamese troops were seen leading Mr. Vu Van Mau away on May 3, 1975, but on May 4 Saigon Radio said that he had been released. In 1976, North and South Vietnam were united.

 Mr. Vu Van Mau was born and raised in Hanoi, earned a doctorate in law from the University of Paris, practiced law in Hanoi and moved to Saigon in 1954, after Vietnam's partition, along with his wife -- who died in 1969 -- a daughter and four sons. He went on to become dean of the University of Saigon's faculty of law and later Foreign Minister and then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under South Vietnam's President, Ngo Dinh Diem, from 1955 to 1963.

 In 1963, after South Vietnamese forces attacked Buddhist clergy, Mr. Vu Van Mau resigned his Government post and ""shaved his head like a Buddhist monk as a gesture of protest,"" Stanley Karnow wrote in his book ""Vietnam: a History""(1983, Penguin). At that time, Mr. Karnow said in an interview, ""He was a gentle sort of guy.""

 In the mid 1960's he was South Vietnam's Ambassador to Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. He was a senator from 1970 to 1975.

"Roy P. Benavidez, a former Green Beret sergeant who received the Medal of Honor from President Ronald Reagan for heroism while wounded in the Vietnam War, then fought to keep the Government from cutting off his disability payments, died on Sunday at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio.",49568,1998-12-04 00:00:00,"Roy P. Benavidez, a former Green Beret sergeant who received the Medal of Honor from President Ronald Reagan for heroism while wounded in the Vietnam War, then fought to keep the Government from cutting off his disability payments, died on Sunday at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio. He was 63.

 Mr. Benavidez, who lived in El Campo, Tex., suffered respiratory failure, the hospital said. His right leg was amputated in October because of complications of diabetes.

 On the morning of May 2, 1968, Mr. Benavidez, a staff sergeant with the Army's Special Forces, the Green Berets, heard the cry ""get us out of here"" over his unit's radio while at his base in Loc Ninh, South Vietnam. He also heard ""so much shooting, it sounded like a popcorn machine.""

 The call for aid came from a 12-man Special Forces team -- 3 Green Berets and 9 Montagnard tribesmen -- that had been ambushed by North Vietnamese troops at a jungle site a few miles inside Cambodia.

 Sergeant Benavidez jumped aboard an evacuation helicopter that flew to the scene. ""When I got on that copter, little did I know we were going to spend six hours in hell,"" he later recalled.

 After leaping off the helicopter, Sergeant Benavidez was shot in the face, head and right leg, but he ran toward his fellow troops, finding four dead and the others wounded.

 He dragged survivors aboard the helicopter, but its pilot was killed by enemy fire as he tried to take off, and the helicopter crashed and burned. Sergeant Benavidez got the troops off the helicopter, and over the next six hours, he organized return fire, called in air strikes, administered morphine and recovered classified documents, although he got shot in the stomach and thigh and hit in the back by grenade fragments.

 He was bayoneted by a North Vietnamese soldier, whom he killed with a knife. Finally, he shot two enemy soldiers as he dragged the survivors aboard another evacuation helicopter.

 When he arrived at Loc Ninh, Sergeant Benavidez was unable to move or speak. Just as he was about to be placed into a body bag, he spit into a doctor's face to signal that he was still alive and was evacuated for surgery in Saigon.

 Sergeant Benavidez was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1968, but a subsequent recommendation from his commanding officer that he receive the Medal of Honor, the military's highest award for valor, could not be approved until a witness confirmed his deeds.

 That happened in 1980, when Brian O'Connor, the Green Beret who had radioed the frantic message seeking evacuation, was found in the Fiji Islands. Mr. O'Connor told how Mr. Benavidez had rescued eight members of his patrol despite being wounded repeatedly.

 President Reagan presented the Medal of Honor to Mr. Benavidez at the Pentagon on Feb. 24, 1981.

 Shortly before Memorial Day 1983, Mr. Benavidez came forward to say that the Social Security Administration planned to cut off disability payments he had been receiving since he retired from the Army as a master sergeant in 1976. He still had two pieces of shrapnel in his heart and a punctured lung and was in constant pain from his wounds.

 The Government, as part of a cost-cutting review that had led to the termination of disability assistance to 350,000 people over the preceding two years, had decided that Mr. Benavidez could find employment.

 ""It seems like they want to open up your wounds and pour a little salt in,"" Mr. Benavidez said. ""I don't like to use my Medal of Honor for political purposes or personal gain, but if they can do this to me, what will they do to all the others?""

 A White House spokesman said President Reagan was ""personally concerned"" about Mr. Benavidez's situation, and 10 days later the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Margaret M. Heckler, said the disability reviews would become more ""humane and compassionate.""

 Soon afterward, wearing his Medal of Honor, Mr. Benavidez told the House Select Committee on Aging that ""the Administration that put this medal around my neck is curtailing my benefits.""

 Mr. Benavidez appealed the termination of assistance to an administrative law judge, who ruled in July 1983 that he should continue receiving payments.

 When President Reagan presented Mr. Benavidez with the Medal of Honor, he asked the former sergeant to speak to young people. Mr. Benavidez did, visiting schools to stress the need for the education he never had.

 Born in South Texas, the son of a sharecopper, Mr. Benavidez was orphaned as a youngster. He went to live with an uncle, but dropped out of middle school because he was needed to pick sugar beets and cotton. He joined the Army at 19, went to airborne school, then was injured by a land mine in South Vietnam in 1964. Doctors feared he would never walk again, but he recovered and became a Green Beret. He was on his second Vietnam tour when he carried out his rescue mission.

 Mr. Benavidez is survived by his wife, Hilaria; a son, Noel; two daughters, Yvette Garcia and Denise Prochazka; a brother, Roger; five stepbrothers, Mike, Eugene, Frank, Nick and Juquin Benavidez; four sisters, Mary Martinez, Lupe Chavez, Helene Vallejo and Eva Campos, and three grandchildren.

 Over the years, fellow Texans paid tribute to Mr. Benavidez. Several schools, a National Guard armory and an Army Reserve center were named for him.

 But he did not regard himself as someone special.

"Joseph P. Merlino, a rough-hewn Democrat who was a powerful figure in New Jersey politics for years, serving two terms as State Senate president and helping enact key legislation, died on Wednesday at the Forrestal Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Princeton, N.J., where he had been for a week.",41004,1998-10-09 00:00:00,"Joseph P. Merlino, a rough-hewn Democrat who was a powerful figure in New Jersey politics for years, serving two terms as State Senate president and helping enact key legislation, died on Wednesday at the Forrestal Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Princeton, N.J., where he had been for a week. He was 76 and a lifelong resident of Trenton.

 The cause was heart disease and diabetes, said his daughter, Kate Merlino.

 At the time of his death, he was affiliated with the law firm of Joseph Mooney in Trenton. The capital city, long a Democratic stronghold, was his political power base during his 14 years as a state legislator.

 Those years began in 1968, with two terms in the State Assembly, and then 10 years in the State Senate, where he rose to be president from 1978 to 1981. He won that post after two years of pushing the programs of Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, a fellow Democrat. Mr. Byrne was an old friend and political ally who was known to sit in the Merlino kitchen and eat fried hot peppers.

 ""Joe was a natural-born leader,"" Mr. Byrne, who was Governor from 1974 to 1982, said in an interview yesterday. ""He was forceful and committed, one of the last of the true liberals."" Mr. Byrne said Mr. Merlino played a critically important role ""at a time when New Jersey had to do a lot of things like preserve the Pinelands and reform the tax system,"" an era of ""major policy decisions which had to be implemented.""

 As Senate president, Mr. Merlino sponsored the Pinelands Protection Act, which was enacted in 1979, backing up a building moratorium in New Jersey's Pinelands that Governor Byrne had already imposed. The act put the New Jersey authorities in charge of protecting almost 20 percent of the state's land area.

 ""Joe and I shared an emotional commitment to the Pinelands,"" Mr. Byrne said, ""but we had a lot of people against us, and it wasn't an issue that immediately caught the public fancy."" The act received its final legislative approval in the State Assembly by 48 votes to 16. Mr. Byrne, when asked how he and Mr. Merlino prevailed on the issue, said crisply, ""Leadership.""

 But the burly, cigar-loving Mr. Merlino was modest about his skills. ""I was the best D student to graduate from Trenton High School,"" he claimed in a widely quoted interview two decades ago. ""Even my guidance counselor advised me to get a job with the W.P.A.""

 Be that as it may, Mr. Byrne said that while Mr. Merlino was Senate president, ""he was the gatekeeper for a lot of legislation -- it didn't go anywhere unless he wanted it to."" More than a hundred pieces of legislation that were considered ""his bills"" were passed.

 Mr. Byrne said ""a turning point in New Jersey history"" came in 1976 with the passage of the state's graduated income tax after effective backing from Mr. Merlino, who Mr. Byrne said was ""a pretty subtle arm-twister."" Other legislation that Mr. Merlino helped get passed included a program to aid elderly people in paying for prescription medications.

 Born in Trenton, he was the son of Pasquale Merlino and the former Margarita Fuccello. He served in the Army, mainly in the Mediterranean area, and received a bachelor's degree in 1948 from Seton Hall and his law degree in 1951 from Fordham.

 From 1956 to 1989, he was the senior partner in the Trenton law firm of Merlino, Rottkamp & Flacks and its predecessors. In 1989, he retired from the firm.

 Among other posts that he held over the years were assistant prosecutor for Mercer County, N.J., which includes Trenton, and Trenton city attorney.

"Alicia Parla, a sinuous Cuban-born beauty who had a brief but incandescent run as the international Queen of the Rumba, died of cancer on Tuesday at her home in Miami.",41010,1998-10-11 00:00:00,"Alicia Parla, a sinuous Cuban-born beauty who had a brief but incandescent run as the international Queen of the Rumba, died of cancer on Tuesday at her home in Miami. She was 84 and was recalled as the teen-age sensation who became the toast of New York and Paris, captivated crowned heads of Europe and taught the rumba to the Prince of Wales, Josephine Baker and a generation of Depression-weary revelers.

 O.K., it wasn't the rumba. As purists never tire of pointing out, the dance by that name that swept America and Europe in the 1930's and became an Arthur Murray staple was such a tame, watered-down version of the Afro-Cuban original that it was closer to a dance the Cubans call the son.

 Never mind. The authentic street rumba of Havana, whose extravagant, explicit gestures seem more suggestive of mating than of a mating dance, is not something one would have actually wanted to do on a dance floor before the 1980's, or ever on stage.

 Whatever its pedigree, in Miss Parla's hands, or rather hips, the dance the world came to know as the rumba was such an appealing sight that she and it became overnight sensations.

 For Miss Parla, at least, it took some doing. A native of Havana, where her father was a prominent doctor, she attended a convent school in Key West, Fla., then moved to New York with her mother during a period of political instability in Cuba in the 1920's.

 Fortunately, as she pointed out in a 1995 interview with John Dorschner of The Miami Herald, her father, a man so strict that he would never have countenanced dancing as a career, stayed behind in Havana.

 Not that her mother was not strict, too. From the time she was 9, Miss Parla recalled, her mother warned her almost daily that if she did not remain a virgin she would never find a man to marry her.

 It was advice that Miss Parla seems to have taken to heart, in part, perhaps, because her admitted teen-age ambition was to marry a millionaire.

 Her father had other ideas, insisting that his daughter obtain a measure of self-sufficiency by learning to type, ""until a millionaire comes along, as he put it.""

 A dutiful daughter, Miss Parla obliged, but since she was a little girl her real passion had been dancing, and when a man who ran a dance studio in her apartment building marveled at her skill, she began to get the notion that she might actually become a professional.

 She got her chance in 1931 after she began working as a 17-year-old cigarette girl at a Greenwich Village nightclub, a job she was able to take over her mother's objections only after promising never to let her father know, agreeing to let her mother serve as on-the-job chaperone and threatening suicide, something Miss Parla did with alarming regularity throughout her life.

 Then came the inevitable night that the club's Spanish dancer became ill. Miss Parla volunteered to take her place, and, well, she was such a hit and gained such confidence that when the celebrated Cuban band leader Don Azpiazu issued a call for a rumba dancer for a gig at the Paramount a few weeks later, Miss Parla tried out, along with 150 other hopefuls, and got the job.

 During rehearsals she was paired with a man, but she found him so clumsy and the whole experience so embarrassing that she persuaded Mr. Azpiazu to let her dance alone, as she did from then on. ""The rumba is very sexual,"" she explained, ""and I didn't like doing it with a partner.""

 The decision may well have been crucial in allowing the rumba's eventual acceptance by a puritanical world, since for all Miss Parla's sensuous gyrations, the sight of a woman dancing alone was simply not as sexually suggestive as a couple dancing together.

 It was the Paramount engagement that helped make the Azpiazu recording of ""El Manisero"" (""The Peanut Vendor"") a national hit and the foundation of the rumba craze of the 1930's.

 After touring the United States with the Azpiazu orchestra (a musician's wife serving as her chaperone), then dancing with another orchestra at the Tavern on the Green in Central Park, Miss Parla (and her mother) joined Mr. Azpiazu for a European tour in 1932.

 It was during an engagement in Monte Carlo that Miss Parla caught the eye of two future kings of England, Edward, the Prince of Wales, and his brother Albert, the Duke of York, who later became King George VI. The next day Edward summoned Miss Parla to his villa to teach him the rumba, as she did (with her mother tagging along). ""He got it,"" she said. ""He was very good.""

 When another of her Monte Carlo conquests, Maurice Chevalier, asked her to go to Nice with him for the night, Miss Parla declined, saying, as she recalled, ""Oh, Mr. Chevalier, I'm so sorry. I'm a virgin.""

 For all her triumph in Monte Carlo, Miss Parla was hardly prepared for what happened when she opened in Paris that July. When she made her entrance walking down a grand staircase wearing a slave scarf and a costume decorated in red, white and blue, the colors of the Cuban flag, the crowd went wild, she recalled, and began shouting ""Vive La France.""

 Miss Parla later learned that it was Bastille Day and that the crowd had taken it as a tribute to France when she appeared wearing the colors of the French flag. The next day, she was hailed by critics as ""the Cuban Mariana,"" (the French Uncle Sam, she was told) and the name stuck. Within weeks, ""Mariana scarfs,"" copied from her costume, were on sale in chic French shops, Miss Parla had taught Josephine Baker to rumba and had made a side trip to Brussels, where King Leopold was so enchanted he gave her a box of chocolates so big she danced on it for him.

 After a triumphant return to the United States aboard the Ile de France in 1933, Miss Parla spent a year dancing at Mon Paris nightclub, where she was hailed by Walter Winchell as ""that lovely Havana torso flipper."" Finally bowing to her father's wishes, she returned to Havana at the end of 1934 and married a few months later. She was not yet 21, but her reign as the Queen of the Rumba was over.

 After her first husband, the playboy son of a wealthy rancher, discovered he couldn't keep her down on the finca after she'd seen Paree, Miss Parla obtained a divorce and later married Guillermo Amuchastegui, a celebrated jai alai player who took her all over the world, and she hobnobbed with the likes of Orson Welles and Esther Williams (when she wasn't in Cuba hobnobbing with Ernest Hemingway).

 When Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Miss Parla, by then married to a Batista government official, fled to the United States and settled in Miami. To make ends meet the former Queen of the Rumba, her father's daughter to the end, spent 20 years working as a typist.

 Miss Parla is survived by a daughter, Ileana Comas, and a sister, Zilia Navarete, both of Miami, and two grandsons.","October 11, 1998, Sunday, Late Edition - Final  Alicia Parla, 84, Dies; Showed the World How to Rumba"
"Shafik al-Wazzan, Prime Minister of Lebanon during the tumultuous 1980's, died yesterday at his home in Beirut.",32941,1999-07-09 00:00:00,"Shafik al-Wazzan, Prime Minister of Lebanon during the tumultuous 1980's, died yesterday at his home in Beirut. He was 74.

 The cause was a heart attack, the Beirut radio reported.

 Mr. Wazzan was a lawyer, a moderate Sunni Muslim and a former Minister of Justice when he became a compromise choice as Prime Minister in 1980, while the country was racked by a civil war that had begun in 1975 between Muslims, Christians and Palestinians.

 He was plagued, as Prime Minister, by Lebanon's strife-embittered politics, but he managed to form two cabinets before being forced to step down in 1984.

 During those years, the civil war continued, and in 1982 his country was shaken further by an Israeli invasion and by the massacre of almost 900 civilians in two Palestinian refugee camps by Christian Phalangist forces.

 In 1983, as Thomas L. Friedman, now a columnist for The New York Times, wrote in his book ""From Beirut to Jerusalem"" (Farrar Straus Giroux, 1989), the United States brokered a peace treaty between the Lebanese Government, led by President Amin Gemayel, and Israel, which was ""a lopsided -- if impracticable -- agreement favoring Israel that deepened Lebanese Muslim resentment.""

 Mr. Wazzan warned that the resentment was rising, and in May 1983, when the pact was agreed upon, he is said to have told Secretary of State George P. Shultz: ""This is not an honorable agreement. I don't believe America has done its best"" in curbing Israel's demands.

 The accord was not put into effect. In October 1983 a truck filled with explosives killed 241 Americanservicemen in their barracks in Beirut. Mr. Friedman wrote that Washington's ""not curtailing Israel's demands for a peace treaty with Beirut"" had helped fuel the violence.

 Mr. Wazzan was born in Beirut and received his law degree from St. Joseph's University there.

 He is survived by his wife, Wajiha; a son, Wassim, and a daughter, Sawsan.

"William Whitelaw, a key aide to his fellow Conservative Margaret Thatcher while she was Britain's Prime Minister, died in his sleep overnight, his family said yesterday.",32907,1999-07-02 00:00:00,"William Whitelaw, a key aide to his fellow Conservative Margaret Thatcher while she was Britain's Prime Minister, died in his sleep overnight, his family said yesterday. He was 81 and was long associated with the town of Penrith in northwestern England.

 Lord Whitelaw had been ill for several months, the Press Association, a British news agency, reported without saying where he died and where he resided at the time of his death.

 Known for most of his career as William Whitelaw, and often called Willie, he was awarded a hereditary peerage in 1983 by Queen Elizabeth II and became the first Viscount Whitelaw of Penrith in Cumbria.

 Prime Minister Tony Blair, a Laborite, said yesterday: ""He was a politician who commanded enormous respect from friend and foe alike.""

 Lord Whitelaw was renowned as a political fixer on Mrs. Thatcher's behalf. Also, as he put it once, ""I'm never an accelerator, but I'm the best brake she has.""

 He was a skilled political tactician and served as deputy leader of the Conservative Party for 16 years. He was sometimes called the last of the Conservative Party's grandees and the person to whom Mrs. Thatcher always turned when a crisis loomed.

 In 1972 and 1973 he was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under another Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath.

 Mr. Whitelaw managed to get a power-sharing pact put in place that was meant to provide Northern Ireland's Roman Catholic minority a role in its governance. But the project crumbled after a general strike by Protestants.

 Despite the earthy aspects of Mr. Whitelaw's work, he had elite credentials: He was born in Edinburgh into a well-known Scottish family and was an alumnus of the boarding school Winchester and of Cambridge University. And he won a high decoration, the Military Cross, for his prowess as an army major commanding tanks in World War II. But he liked to describe himself as a farmer and a landowner.

 Mr. Whitelaw was a Member of Parliament for a constituency including Penrith, from 1955 to 1983 and was prominent in the House of Parliament for a quarter century.

 William Hague, the Conservative Party leader, expressed a widely held view yesterday when he said that Lord Whitelaw was ""one of the towering figures of British politics.""

 Under Mr. Heath he was also leader of the House of Commons. Under Mrs. Thatcher he was Home Secretary, Deputy Prime Minister and, from 1983 to 1988, leader of the governing Conservative Party in the House of Lords.

 In 1988, after a slight stroke, he resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and from his leadership post in the House of Lords. Mrs. Thatcher said at the time that she had a ""great sense of loss"" and ""because your well-being comes first, sadly I have no choice but to accept your resignation.""

 Political analysts said then that the lack of Lord Whitelaw's skill at conciliating and compromising would be a grave loss for the Thatcher Government. And indeed, Mrs. Thatcher was ousted from the prime ministership two years later by an uprising among Conservative members of Parliament.

 Lord Whitelaw's survivors include his wife, the former Cecelia Doriel, whom he married in 1943; and four daughters. There is no heir to the viscountcy.

Cashel Jr., the former chairman of Campbell Soup and the chief financial officer of AT&T during its deregulation, died on Tuesday at his home in Amelia Island, Fla. He was 80.

 The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his wife, Marie, said.

 Mr. Cashel spent most of his career with American Telephone and Telegraph, rising to the position of vice chairman and chief financial officer in 1977. The government ordered the reorganization of the company in 1982, which required it to divest itself of 22 local telephone companies, while retaining its long-distance service; the Western Electric Company, its manufacturing arm; and Bell Laboratories, its research operation. Mr. Cashel led a group of executives from all parts of the company charged with devising an equitable breakup that would meet the government mandate and assure the financial viability of all of the new companies.

 The team came up with a plan for dividing more than $80 billion in assets, everything from physical equipment like the cables that brought service to businesses and homes to accounts receivable. When Mr. Cashel left AT&T in 1983, the final plan had been submitted to the company chairman, Charles L. Brown. The breakup was completed in 1984.

 Mr. Cashel was named chairman of Campbell Soup in 1984; he had been on the company's board since 1976. He served as chairman for four years, and retired in 1990.

 Mr. Cashel graduated from Dartmouth College in 1941 with a bachelor's degree. During World War II, he served with the Marines.

 In 1946, he joined the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, one of the local telephone companies within AT&T, as an engineer. During the next 31 years, Mr. Cashel held several positions with AT&T units, including general manager at the Diamond State Telephone Company in Wilmington, Del., and president of the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia from 1970 to 1977, before he became chief financial officer of the parent company.

 In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, William III, of Pasadena, Calif.; Robert, of Summit, N.J.; and Peter, of Harrodsburg, Ky.; a daughter, Christine, of Stillwater, Okla.; and seven grandchildren.

"Brian MacRae, who for 15 years was the Queen of England's personal bagpiper, died on Sept. 3.",6180,2000-10-01 00:00:00,"Brian MacRae, who for 15 years was the Queen of England's personal bagpiper, died on Sept. 3. He was 58.

 The cause was a heart attack while he was on vacation in France, The Times of London said.

 Pipe-Major MacRae's principal duty, starting at precisely 9 a.m., was to play for 15 minutes under the window of Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle or Balmoral Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Scotland. Tradition required that he march up and down four times as he brought forth his instrument's eerie, inimitable sound.

 He also piped at the queen's dinner table, and was responsible for the 12 pipers who played around the table at state banquets.

 His daily duties did not end with the morning serenade. His next duty was to escort the queen from her private quarters to her first appointment of the day. He also served as page of the presence, responsible for meeting and escorting the queen's visitors, including the prime minister and ambassadors, to the Grand Entrance of Buckingham Palace.

 ""His expert playing, composing skills and cheerfulness earned him his coveted post,"" The Daily Mail newspaper reported. ""Once, as a birthday treat, he woke the queen on the Royal Train with one of his familiar medleys.""

 Brian MacRae was born in Aberdeen on March 27, 1942. His grandfather and father played the pipes, and he began to play at 6. The Times of London reported that his father insisted that he learn a trade so he apprenticed as a yacht builder and cabinetmaker.

 He joined the army at 18, serving with the Royal Engineers. He transferred to the Gordon Highlanders two years later. He rose from piper to pipe-major in nine years on the strength of his virtuosity and skill at composing. But his duties extended beyond music: he commanded his drummers and pipers as a rifle platoon in Northern Ireland in 1976.

 He was selected to be the queen's piper in 1980. He was the ninth person to fill the position since Queen Victoria first heard bagpipes when she and Prince Albert visited the Scottish Highlands for the first time in 1842 and the queen declared, in a letter to her mother: ""I must have a piper.""

 Pipe-Major MacRae became particularly known as a composer for the bagpipe. His ""Cannongate"" strathspey, a Scottish dance a bit slower than the reel, won the Scottish Division competition in 1976. When Prince Charles visited the Gordons as their colonel in chief in 1978, he was greeted by ""Prince Charles March,"" composed by Pipe-Major MacRae.

 A reel he wrote the same year, called ""The Tache"" and dedicated to his commander, was said to be ""probably the best new reel since the war"" by the piper and critic Archie Kenneth, according to The Times.

 He retired as the queen's piper at 52, because of Army retirement policies, and played at weddings and funerals afterward. He is survived by his wife, Joan, and daughters, Fiona and Helen.

 At a private observance at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle that preceded his private funeral, The Mail reported, a band of pipers struck up ""Lord Lovat's Lament"" as his coffin was carried to the hearse.

 In his long political career, he was deputy prime minister, ambassador to East Germany and vice chairman of the Standing Committee of China's Fifth National People's Congress and held senior posts in the Chinese Communist Party.

 Mr. Ji, deputy foreign minister from 1955 to 1972, was foreign minister from 1972 to 1974.

Watson Webb Jr., the former president and chairman of the Shelburne Museum in Vermont, whose family was among the country's pre-eminent art collectors, died on Saturday in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 84 and had homes in Los Angeles and Shelburne.

 Born into the wealth and society of the grand American industrialists, Mr. Webb was raised in New York and Shelburne. His parents owned Shelburne Farms, a vast estate built beside Lake Champlain by his paternal grandparents, Dr. William Seward Webb and Lila Osgood Vanderbilt, a daughter of William Henry Vanderbilt, the railroad tycoon.

 In New York, Mr. Webb's parents and maternal grandparents, Louisine and Henry Havemeyer, the sugar refiner, had adjoining Fifth Avenue town houses, where he recalled as a child gazing at the seven Rembrandts on the walls of his grandparents' library. The Havemeyers were avid collectors and on her death in 1929, his grandmother left nearly 2,000 artworks to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, many of them by Degas and Manet.

 His mother, Electra Havemeyer Webb, had inherited her parents' passion for art but channeled it in a new direction by founding the Shelburne Museum in 1947 with a collection of Americana.

 Mr. Webb is largely credited with completing the museum and its collection -- some 80,000 objects housed in 37 historic buildings on 45 acres -- after becoming the museum's president when his mother died in 1960. He held the position until 1977, when he became chairman of the board.

 In 1996, Mr. Webb resigned to protest the board's decision to sell an estimated $25 million worth of art, with proceeds allocated for a collections care endowment, as it tried to handle financial difficulties. He said plans to sell Impressionist works his mother had given to the museum violated the code of ethics of the American Association of Museums, which forbids selling artworks for purposes other than acquiring more art. The works were sold at Sotheby's in late 1996 for $32.8 million.

 Mr. Webb attended the Groton School and then Yale, from which he graduated in 1938. He moved to California in 1946, where he was hired by 20th Century-Fox as an apprentice film cutter. In 1949, after a meeting with Darryl F. Zanuck, he was promoted to assistant film cutter. He eventually became Zanuck's head film cutter, editing such works as ""The Razor's Edge,"" which starred Tyrone Power, and founding the American Cinema Editors.

He was 89.

 Mr. Thomson's long struggle with Parkinson's disease and heart disease had slowed him in recent years but did not diminish his political zeal or stature in the Republican right wing, friends said.

 Long after Mr. Thomson left the Governor's Mansion in 1979, after three two-year terms, his maple sugar farm was a requisite stop for Republican candidates seeking traction in the New Hampshire presidential primary. Some of that influence derived from his alliance with William Loeb, the publisher of the Manchester Union Leader, who died in 1981.

 ""They were virtually indistinguishable,"" said Donald R. Dwight, a former Republican official from Massachusetts whose family owns a smaller, rival newspaper, The Concord Monitor.

 Mr. Thomson became a columnist for The Union Leader, the state's dominant newspaper, after leaving office.

 Though born in Pittsburgh and reared in the South, Mr. Thomson became closely identified with the prickly independence of New Hampshire, where he settled with his wife, Gale, in 1954. His political campaigns relied on a series of well-remembered slogans, among them ""Ax the Tax"" and ""Keep Your Guns,"" and he cared so passionately about the state's ""Live Free or Die"" motto that he fought a resident all the way to the Supreme Court over the man's decision to cover up those words on his license plate.

 Such advocacy infuriated civil libertarians, environmentalists and gay and women's rights advocates, who accused the governor of riding roughshod over Constitutional protections. Mr. Thomson, who frequently ran afoul of the courts, fought for the voluntary recitation of the Lord's Prayer in public schools, threatened to revoke the charter of a state college that held a conference on prison reform in 1973 and ordered that the title ""Ms."" not be used in official communications.

 With a fervent but courtly public demeanor and a drawl still evident a half-century after he left the South, he seemed to revel in such controversies.

 Mr. Thomson, who once said he had become a Republican after reading a biography of Abraham Lincoln, anticipated a kindred spirit, Ronald Reagan, who rose on the national stage just as Mr. Thomson was leaving office. In New Hampshire, which has no personal income or general sales tax, Mr. Thomson fought against the primacy of the federal government over states' rights.

 When his critics derided Mr. Thomson for espousing beliefs from the 19th century, the governor replied with characteristic confidence. ""They are wrong,"" he said. ""My beliefs are rooted in the values of the 17th century, and I'm proud of it.""

 Mr. Thomson's confrontational approach extended even to neighboring states. A disagreement over fishing rights in 1973 left New Hampshire and Maine on the verge of a ""lobster war,"" as patrol boats dispatched by Mr. Thomson and Gov. Kenneth M. Curtis of Maine challenged each other repeatedly in disputed waters.

 Born in 1912 to a mother from Boston and a father with roots in Georgia, Mr. Thomson once recalled growing up in a family as ""poor as church mice"" in numerous cities in South, where his father worked as a civil engineer.

 He attended the University of Miami and Mercer University in Macon, Ga., where his Republican leanings were unusual, then graduated with a law degree from the University of Georgia.

 After leaving a legal practice in Florida, Mr. Thomson founded a legal publishing firm in Brooklyn. He met his wife of 62 years, the former Gale Kelly, at the company, where she worked as a secretary. He is survived by his wife and their six children: Peter, David, Thomas, Marion Gale, Janet and Rob.

 In 1954, the couple moved to New Hampshire, where they established the Equity Publishing Company, which was later managed by their sons.

 Mr. Thomson became chairman of the school board in Orford, then promptly plunged into his signature issue. He helped found a political group called the Taxfighters, and along with nine other towns in the state, Orford became famous for rejecting federal funds intended for a remedial reading program.

 Mr. Thomson lost two primary bids to run for governor, in 1968 and 1970. After his second loss, he dismayed some Republicans by running in the general election on the American Independent Party ticket of Gov. George Wallace of Alabama.

 Then, in 1972, he defeated Roger J. Crowley, the incumbent Democrat, with a strong antitax message. Despite that, Mr. Thomson was quickly embroiled in a tax controversy when he instructed an aide to look through the returns of a dozen businesses, some of which were identified with his critics. The State Supreme Court ruled months later that the search had been illegal, while acknowledging that there was little that could be done about it.

 Mr. Thomson, who never explained what he had been seeking in the records, replied with a refrain that grew to become familiar. The court was entitled to its interpretation of the law, he said, and he was entitled to his.","The New York Times                               April 20, 2001 Friday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Meldrim Thomson, 89, Dies; Governed New Hampshire"

"Lord Hartwell, a lifelong newspaperman who as chairman and editor in chief of The Daily Telegraph for 33 years, was one of the last of the Fleet Street press barons, died on Tuesday in a hospital here.",58363,2001-04-05 00:00:00,"Lord Hartwell, a lifelong newspaperman who as chairman and editor in chief of The Daily Telegraph for 33 years, was one of the last of the Fleet Street press barons, died on Tuesday in a hospital here. He was 89.

 Taking over the paper from his father in 1954 after having worked on family papers in Scotland, he increased circulation, to 1.4 million from 1 million. In 1960, Lord Hartwell created what he called his proudest achievement, The Sunday Telegraph, to compete with the dominant newspaper at that time, The Sunday Times.

 Shy and dignified in his personal manner, he believed in unadorned news reporting. ""You don't want a lot of highfalutin waffle before you get to the point,"" he said. ""If you read the whole of the first paragraph of a story and still don't know what it's about, it's no good.""

 The straightforward formula and the paper's faithfulness to Conservative principles made it a popular choice for readers in the highly competitive British news market at a time when incomes were rising and labor disruptions were few.

 But Lord Hartwell's attention to the business side of the enterprise never matched his obsession with its journalism, and its growing economic problems suffered from front office neglect and ended up obliging him to sell a majority of the shares in 1985 to its current owner, Conrad Black, the Canadian newspaper publisher who heads Hollinger Inc.

 William Michael Berry was born on May 18, 1911, the son of Viscount Camrose, who had been part of a partnership that acquired The Daily Telegraph in 1927 and became its outright owner in 1937. Mr. Berry, as he was called until becoming Lord Hartwell on taking a life peerage in 1968, was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, and received his early journalism training in newsrooms in Glasgow and Aberdeen before joining the wartime Army and becoming a lieutenant colonel.

 He married Lady Pamela Smith, a zesty figure in prewar society who made up for his reclusiveness with her dinner parties and gossip. The couple had two sons and two daughters, who all survive. Lady Pamela died in 1982.

 Though he was the indisputable boss at the newspaper, his employees felt his presence by orders passed to editors and scribbled directives rather than through personal contact. According to the paper's obituary of him today, subordinates would speak of him only in the passive mode, saying not that ""Lord Hartwell wants such and such a story"" but, ""This is a wanted story.""

 When he arrived at the office, an elevator was cleared, and he made his way alone to his clubby fifth-floor paneled suite with its maps of the world as it had been in 1914, silver and porcelain collection, roof garden, view of St. Paul's and two black-suited butlers in attendance.

 It was there that, following the routine laid down by his father, he met the managing editor of news in the morning and the editor of the editorial pages in the evening. He saw galley proofs of all articles and made suggestions that, though modestly delivered, were treated on the newsroom floor as dicta.

 It was said that the first time he ventured inside the King and Keys, the Telegraph's Fleet Street pub, was the night in 1987 when the paper left its longtime home and moved out to the Docklands area of East London that has become the home for many newspapers. If that occurred, it would have been a melancholy moment for Lord Hartwell, because the journey to the new glass wall headquarters was one that he would not make.

 The technology in the new plant was essential to the survival of the paper. But Lord Hartwell had failed to anticipate its need and great cost, developments that forced him to relinquish control.

 Commenting on how he let the finances get away from him, he said: ""I was always terribly shocked when other people ran their newspapers like biscuit factories, just to make money. What I was trying to do was to make The Telegraph an institution which was respected and admired and which would leave the world the poorer if it were not there. It sounds awfully boring, but I regarded it as my life's work. That's all.""

 Lord Hartwell remained a newspaperman until the end. His family reported that he had died with a copy of The Daily Telegraph in his hands.","The New York Times                               April 5, 2001 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Lord Hartwell, 89, a Last Fleet Street Baron"

"F. Kenneth Iverson, the former chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, who revolutionized the steel industry and turned his steel mini-mill into the nation's largest steel producer, died on Sunday in Charlotte, N.C..",56516,2002-04-17 00:00:00,"F. Kenneth Iverson, the former chief executive of the Nucor Corporation, who revolutionized the steel industry and turned his steel mini-mill into the nation's largest steel producer, died on Sunday in Charlotte, N.C.. He was 76.

 Daniel R. DiMicco, Nucor's chief executive, declined to disclose a specific cause but said Mr. Iverson had been in failing health.

 In an industry awash with bankruptcies, outmoded technologies and a history of labor turmoil, Mr. Iverson outdid the competition by recycling steel scrap into products through the smaller, cheaper and more cost-efficient mini-mills. Once on the fringes of a steel industry dominated by expensive blast-furnace technology, Mr. Iverson bucked industry trends and turned his company into a survivor while others fell by the wayside.

 Today, mini-mills produce more than half the steel made in the United States, with Nucor being the largest and most profitable. Nucor also stood apart from the steel industry under Mr. Iverson, who kept his labor force largely nonunion and who did not participate in the perennial industry cries for protection from foreign competition.

 Born in Downers Grove, Ill., a rural town west of Chicago, Mr. Iverson attended Northwestern University from 1943 to 1944 but left to serve in the Navy in World War II, reaching the rank of lieutenant. In 1946, he finished his studies at Cornell, where he earned a degree in aeronautical engineering. That was followed, in 1947, by a master's degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue.

 After several engineering jobs, Mr. Iverson joined the Nuclear Corporation of America's Vulcraft unit, which was based in Phoenix and made steel products. In three years, he made his steel division a success while the rest of the company headed for bankruptcy. In 1965, he was named president of Nuclear. In short order, Mr. Iverson shed the company's money-losing businesses, moved operations to Charlotte and focused exclusively on making steel using new mini-mill technology.

 In 1972, the company changed its name to Nucor and set out on a path that turned Mr. Iverson into an innovator, not only in making steel but also in corporate management. His philosophy was one that stressed having a small corporate staff -- Nucor has only about 50 headquarters employees, one of the smallest for a Fortune 500 company.

 He tied employee pay to corporate performance, put his plants in rural areas where labor costs were low and eschewed corporate perquisites like executive dining rooms, parking spaces and company cars.

 A popular speaker on the corporate lecture circuit, Mr. Iverson distilled his business philosophy into a book, ""Plain Talk: Lessons From a Business Maverick."" One of his often-quoted maxims was that mistakes were as much part of his job as successes. ""My goal is to make the right decision 60 percent of the time,"" he said.

 At the beginning, mini-mills were little threat to big steel, which turned iron ore into steel. But by continually improving the technology of recycling, Nucor was able to turn scrap into an increasingly sophisticated product line and is now one of the biggest makers of steel for construction projects. While anti-Japanese sentiment was running high in the American steel industry in the mid-1980's, Nucor formed a joint venture with a Japanese steel maker that now dominates the market for construction beams.

 Mr. Iverson stepped down as Nucor's chief executive in 1996 and retired as Nucor chairman in 1998.

 He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Martha; a daughter, Claudia Sturges; and a son, Marc Miller, both of Charlotte.","The New York Times                              April 17, 2002 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  F.

 Family members said Mr. di Tella, a former ambassador to the United States, had suffered a stroke at his country home and died at a Buenos Aires hospital.

 He was foreign minister under President Carlos Saul Menem in the 1990's, when Argentina and Britain reconciled after the war over the Falkland Islands, a British possession off the Argentine coast.

 His diplomacy was credited with bringing about Mr. Menem's emotional 1998 visit to Britain, the first by an Argentine leader after the war.

 The 75-day Falkland war ended when the British drove Argentine forces off the wind-swept archipelago in a decisive victory.

 Under Mr. Menem, Mr. di Tella also built warm relations with the United States.

 Mr. di Tella studied industrial engineering and received a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the 1970's he began an association with the dominant Peronist party and rose steadily through the ranks.

"Winton M. Blount, the last postmaster general to serve in a president's cabinet and the first chairman of the Postal Service, which he helped create, died on Thursday at his second home in Highlands, N.C.",37091,2002-10-26 00:00:00,"Winton M. Blount, the last postmaster general to serve in a president's cabinet and the first chairman of the Postal Service, which he helped create, died on Thursday at his second home in Highlands, N.C. He was 81.

 The cause was a long illness, said Joe McInnes, the executive director of the Blount Foundation, Mr. Blount's philanthropy.

 As President Richard M. Nixon's postmaster general, Mr. Blount (pronounced blunt) was the architect of a sweeping reorganization of the Post Office Department, calling for removal of the postmaster general from the cabinet and the creation of a self-supporting postal corporation owned by the federal government.

 He was also an active philanthropist and art collector who played an important role in Alabama Republican politics for about 50 years.

 A successful construction executive, Mr. Blount was serving as president of the United States Chamber of Commerce in 1969, when Mr. Nixon asked him to join the cabinet. He was given the task of modernizing the postal service and making it more efficient.

 In May 1969, Mr. Blount offered four basic reforms: adequate financial authority; removal of the system from politics, assuring continuity of management; collective bargaining between postal management and employees; and the power to set postal rates after hearings before an impartial panel.

 The ideas became the main elements of the nation's most comprehensive postal legislation, which Mr. Nixon signed into law on Aug. 12, 1970. The new Postal Service, an independent institution in the executive branch, began operating on July 1, 1971, with Mr. Blount as chairman of its board.

 Mr. Blount called the reorganization a triumph of persistence and determination. In his 1996 autobiography, ""Doing It My Way,"" he wrote: ""Congress isn't used to dealing with someone who never gives up. When they knock someone down, he usually goes away. I didn't.""

 But a few months after the reorganization, he resigned and returned to Alabama to run for the Senate, a campaign in which George W. Bush worked as an aide. Mr. Blount was defeated by the incumbent, John J. Sparkman, a veteran Democrat.

 Mr. Blount's family said he became active in Republican politics in 1952, when he supported Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's bid for president. He worked on Mr. Nixon's campaign for president in 1960.

 Mr. Blount once said he had politics ""in my blood."" A wall in his home was lined with photographs of him with several presidents, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Gerald R. Ford and the first President Bush.

 In June 1963, when Gov. George Wallace tried to block the enrollment of two black students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, by standing in a doorway of the University of Alabama, Mr. Blount, a longtime trustee at the university, said he called Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general, at his home to try to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

 Mr. Blount, in his autobiography, said Mr. Kennedy proposed letting the governor read his speech, in which he contended the federal government had overstepped its powers, if Mr. Wallace would then step aside. Mr. Wallace's staged anti-integration protest played out before millions of Americans on televisions across the country.

 Born in Union Springs, Ala., on Feb. 1, 1921, Winton Malcolm Blount Jr. attended the Staunton Military Academy in Staunton, Va., and the University of Alabama.

 He served from 1942 to 1945 in the Army Air Forces as a B-29 pilot, ending his service as a first lieutenant.

 After World War II, Mr. Blount and his brother, Houston, formed Blount Brothers Construction with four war-surplus tractors they bought for $28,000. The company, which grew throughout the 1970's and 1980's, eventually becoming Blount International Inc., built a launching complex at Cape Canaveral, the Superdome in New Orleans and the $2-billion King Saud University in Saudi Arabia.

 Mr. Blount is survived by his wife, Carolyn; a daughter, Kay B. Miles of Birmingham, Ala.; four sons, Winton III, of Montgomery, Ala., Thomas, of Los Angeles, Samuel, of Birmingham, and Joseph, of Southampton, N.Y.; and two stepchildren, Dr. Robert E. Varner Jr. of Birmingham and Carolyn Stuart Varner King of Lillian, Ala. He is also survived by his brother, 14 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren.

 Mr. Blount's first marriage, to Mary K. Archibald, ended in divorce in 1981.

 In 1988, Mr. Blount donated 42 paintings, valued at about $15 million, to the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts. Through his foundation, he also spent $22 million to build a theater for the Alabama Shakespeare Festival on 250 acres next to his home in Montgomery, and $20 million on the Blount Cultural Park there.

 Mr. Blount also contributed $10 million to the Smithsonian National Postal Museum here, $5 million to Rhodes College in Memphis, $5 million to Huntingdon College in Montgomery and more than $8 million to the University of Alabama.","The New York Times                             October 26, 2002 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Winton Blount, 81, a Founder Of the New Postal Service"
"Murray Baron, a labor lawyer and consultant and former Liberal Party leader who became the president of the conservative journalism criticism group Accuracy in Media, died on Monday in Greenwich, Conn.",36965,2002-09-26 00:00:00,"Murray Baron, a labor lawyer and consultant and former Liberal Party leader who became the president of the conservative journalism criticism group Accuracy in Media, died on Monday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 94.

 In a long career in labor in which his personal politics gradually veered to the right, he struggled to keep unions honest and free of undue influence from either communism or criminals. He worked closely with Robert F. Kennedy in his investigation of James Hoffa, the Teamsters leader, said Mr. Baron's wife, Claire.

 His labor interests led him into politics. He joined the Socialist Party, in part because of its opposition to communism, and later became a founder of the New York Liberal Party, whose Senate nomination he once sought.

 Murray Baron was born in Brooklyn on June 28, 1908. His parents, Eastern European socialists, lived in France and left for New York from England. His father was a cigar maker and his mother a union organizer. He graduated from Columbia University and Brooklyn Law School and began working for unions, particularly the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the International Pocketbook and Luggage Workers Union.

 He joined the wage and hours division of the Labor Department. In the late 30's, he won what was then a large back-pay settlement for 10,000 knitted-goods workers, a quarter of a million dollars.

 He joined the Socialist Party, then headed by Norman Thomas, and worked as a party organizer in the South. He met Claire Librescot, his wife of 68 years, in the party. He is also survived by their daughter, Lynn Baron Henson of Philadelphia.

 In 1936, he ran as a socialist for president of the New York City Board of Aldermen, but lost.

 In his political thinking, however, Mr. Baron gradually became one of what he called ""one of the most ignored groups in the country -- anti-Communist liberals."" He was a founder of the Liberal Party in New York State in 1944 and was one of the first members of Americans for Democratic Action, founded in 1947.

 He was the Manhattan Liberal Party leader, and in 1968 challenged Senator Jacob K. Javits for the Liberal Party's nomination to the United States Senate. His argument was that Mr. Javits, while a good man, was also still a Republican allied with Richard M. Nixon and other Republican leaders.

 Mr. Baron lost by more than 2 to 1, an outcome his wife said he not only expected but welcomed. ""He said, 'I couldn't do it if I wasn't positive I was going to lose,' "" she said.

 Reed Irvine, chairman of Accuracy in Media, said that Mr. Baron joined the group in 1972, three years after its founding. He became president in 1976.

 As president of Accuracy in Media, Mr. Baron joined Mr. Irvine in constant and vocal criticism of what they saw as a leftist political tilt in newspapers and television. Their weapons were speeches, letters, meetings with executives and attendance at publishing companies' annual meetings by virtue of having bought some of their stock. One frequent target of Mr. Baron's criticism was The New York Times, the paper he said he had read and often memorized since childhood.

 In a notable encounter in 1992, at the CBS shareholders' meeting, Mr. Baron took on Dan Rather, the anchor of ""The CBS Evening News,"" for criticizing greed. He suggested Mr. Rather's next contract negotiations be taped and shown in prime time so that viewers could see ""how greed manifests itself even in the networks.""","The New York Times                            September 26, 2002 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Murray Baron, 94, Labor Lawyer And Head of Accuracy in Media"
"Geraldine of Albania, who as the wife of King Zog was for one year her adopted country's first and only queen and the only member of European royalty with American blood, died on Tuesday in Tirana, Albania's capital.",37092,2002-10-27 00:00:00,"Geraldine of Albania, who as the wife of King Zog was for one year her adopted country's first and only queen and the only member of European royalty with American blood, died on Tuesday in Tirana, Albania's capital. She was 87.

 Her story reads as if it were a Hollywood fantasy. Though she was a countess, her family's fortunes had plunged so far that at 20 she was selling postcards in the Budapest National Museum. Then King Zog, who had been desperately seeking a bride, saw her picture. They met on New Year's Day 1938, and 10 days later were engaged.

 The wedding was triumphant. Her veil trailed from a high diadem of orange blossoms and her white satin gown was embroidered with pearls. Fifty thousand children in native costumes applauded, and enemy clans shared wine. The wedding gifts included a Mercedes from Hitler.

 The plot turned. Just a year later, Italy invaded Albania, and Geraldine, still bleeding after giving birth, fled with her infant son in an ambulance over tortuous mountain roads to Greece. The king and 115 members of his court, carrying 10 heavy cases of valuables, followed.

 Geraldine's dreams of founding a dynasty were dead. The tall, graceful queen turned down an offer to be in movies. The couple began the long country-to-country odyssey -- this month a chateau at Versailles, next month a palace in Egypt -- so drearily familiar to banished royalty.

 At the time of his escape, King Zog was believed to have made his situation easier by adding Albania's gold reserve to his large personal fortune, previously deposited in Swiss and English banks. His last act before fleeing was to broadcast an appeal to his people ""to fight to the last drop of blood for Albanian independence.""

 Geraldine Apponyi was born a countess in Budapest on Aug. 6, 1915. Her father was the Hungarian nobleman Count Gyula Apponyi de Nagy-Appony and her mother was the former Gladys Virginia Stewart, a member of an old Virginia family. Geraldine's grandfather had been a high official of the Hapsburg Court.

 But Central European royalty had lost thrones, money and prestige after World War I. Geraldine's father died in 1924, and her mother remarried a French officer. The family insisted that Geraldine and her two sisters be educated in Hungary.

 Circumstances dictated that the young women learn shorthand and typing, but they still went to balls. When she was 17, Geraldine's photograph was taken several times at a ball given by Hungarian monarchists. One of those pictures would change her life.

 Meanwhile, King Zog, who had advanced from tribal chief to prime minister to president to Albania's first monarch and who was sometimes called the Balkan Napoleon, was miserable. He barely escaped assassination in 1931 as he left the Vienna Opera House, and his mother kept watch over the royal kitchen to make sure his food was not poisoned.

 It said he offered a ""handsome fee"" to a marriage broker to find him an attractive bride with an income of $1 million a year. Then he saw the photo. The Muslim king fell in love with a penniless Roman Catholic.

 He invited her to Albania, and she arrived after Christmas in 1937. She was made a princess after accepting his New Year's Day proposal.

 Geraldine charmed the Albanians. When the country's vice president gave her a velvet pocketbook containing the equivalent of $500,000, she directed that it be given to the National Albanian Charities, The New York American reported.

 Geraldine remained a Catholic and was wed in a civil ceremony on April 27, 1938. The circumstances of the wedding hinted at the scheming politics that would abruptly end Geraldine's fairy tale in a year's time. The New York Herald Tribune observed that Geraldine, then 22, ""seems to be marrying the Rome-Berlin axis as well as her king."" It added that she was ""certainly marrying Mussolini's foreign policy.""

 But in April 1939, Italian troops invaded and the king and queen fled. Count Galeazzo Ciano, the Italian foreign minister, who had been King Zog's best man, arrived in a bomber. The immediate pretext for the invasion was the Italian accusation that the king was misusing Italian money, but many suggested that Mussolini was jealous of Hitler's conquests and that Albania was nearby.

 The crown passed to King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, and the couple's wandering began. They passed through Greece, Turkey, Romania, Poland, the Baltic states, Sweden, Belgium and France before landing at the Ritz Hotel in London. Then they moved to Egypt, where King Farouk welcomed exiled royalty.

 When Farouk was overthrown in 1952, they moved to Paris, where King Zog, who had survived numerous assassination attempts, died in 1961. Geraldine then lived in Spain and South Africa before returning to Albania at the invitation of Parliament four months ago.

 She is survived by her son, Leka, who returned to try to take the Albanian throne in 1997, but was rejected 2 to 1 in a referendum.","The New York Times                              October 27, 2002 Sunday                               Late Edition - Final  Geraldine of Albania, 87, Queen With U.S. Ties, Is Dead"
"Roy A. Anderson, who as chairman and chief executive of the Lockheed Corporation steadied and rebuilt the floundering company in the late 1970's and early 1980's, died on Saturday at his home in California.",42813,2003-10-23 00:00:00,"Roy A. Anderson, who as chairman and chief executive of the Lockheed Corporation steadied and rebuilt the floundering company in the late 1970's and early 1980's, died on Saturday at his home in California. He was 82.

 Mr. Anderson had been in failing health for several years, said Barbara Reinike, the director for community relations at Lockheed Martin, the successor to Lockheed.

 Mr. Anderson began his career as an accountant at Lockheed and was named chairman and chief executive in 1977, when the company was mired in political and financial scandals that threatened its future. The company had already been forced to negotiate a federal loan guarantee, something with little precedent at the time. A company poll showed that the public associated it more with financial mismanagement than with any of the airplanes or military hardware that rolled off its assembly lines.

 But by the time Mr. Anderson retired as chief executive in 1985, Lockheed was reporting steady profit growth and had resumed paying dividends after a 15-year hiatus. The federal loan guarantee had been retired because Lockheed could obtain credit without the government's help. At the last annual meeting over which he presided, Mr. Anderson was able to describe winning more than $500 million in contracts for the federal government's Strategic Defense Initiative program, known as Star Wars, and was to predict that more than twice that amount was in the offing.

 He continued as a director until 1990 and was named chairman emeritus in 1987.

 Mr. Anderson became chief executive after several years of turbulence at Lockheed, much of it caused by reports that its senior executives had bribed government officials in at least 15 foreign countries. In Japan, the accusations of bribery eventually led to the ouster of the prime minister, Kakuei Tanaka.

 Lockheed had also earned a reputation for overrunning, by millions of dollars, the cost of building the C-5A cargo plane. In addition, its attempt to enter the commercial aircraft business, with the three-engine L1011 Tristar jet, foundered after Rolls Royce, the manufacturer of the jet engines, went bankrupt.

 As chief executive, Mr. Anderson eventually halted production of the jet, a crucial decision that took Lockheed out of the commercial aircraft business. Focusing on military hardware proved prescient after Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980 and began a military buildup. Lockheed soon regained stature as a top Pentagon contractor, winning contracts for satellites, nuclear missiles, cargo jets, space shuttle maintenance and work on the stealth aircraft.

 After he retired, Mr. Anderson remained active in civic groups and causes, including the Los Angeles Music Center, the Salvation Army and various initiatives to strengthen police, schools and other public services in Los Angeles. When the Los Angeles-area United Way became embroiled in a financial scandal in 1986, he took over as its unpaid acting president and called for a more active board and greater diligence by the outside auditors.

 Mr. Anderson was also a trustee of Stanford University and Occidental College. With his wife, who survives, he established the Roy and Betty Anderson professorship in economics at Stanford. In 1994, he became chairman of the Weingart Foundation.

 Mr. Anderson was born in 1920 in Ripon, Calif., and served in the Navy during World War II and the Korean War. He studied accounting and economics at Stanford and earned a master's degree in business administration. He joined Lockheed in 1956 and became chief financial officer in 1971.

 In addition to his wife, who lives in La Canada, Calif., he is survived by two sons, Ross and Jim; two daughters, Karyn Anderson and Debra White; two brothers, Eugene and Howard; two sisters, Elizabeth and Eleanor; and five grandchildren.","The New York Times                             October 23, 2003 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Roy A.

"David Bar-Illan, a concert pianist, editor and media critic who served as chief spokesman for the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, died yesterday in Jerusalem.",42868,2003-11-05 00:00:00,"David Bar-Illan, a concert pianist, editor and media critic who served as chief spokesman for the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, died yesterday in Jerusalem. He was 73.

 Mr. Bar-Illan died from complications of a heart attack he suffered in February 2000, according to The Jerusalem Post, the newspaper he led as executive editor from 1992 to 1996.

 A native of Haifa, Israel, who spent many years as a young man in the United States, Mr. Bar-Illan won international acclaim as a concert pianist. After graduating from the Juilliard School of Music in 1950, he was a soloist with orchestras in Europe, the United States, Latin America and elsewhere.

 He was perhaps most admired for his performances of work by Liszt. In a review of one recording of work by Liszt and Weber, Bernard Holland wrote in The New York Times in 1982 that Mr. Bar-Illan was ""fleet, powerful and above all, energetic in all this music.""

 But Mr. Bar-Illan's interests extended beyond music to embrace passionate views on politics, which frequency allied him with the Israeli right wing. In one example of his advocacy, he warned of the risks of direct negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, in a 1989 Op-Ed article in The Times.

 ""When used as a ruse, talks, like the Washington negotiations with the Japanese in December 1941, can lead to a Pearl Harbor,"" he wrote.

 Mr. Bar-Illan became editorial page editor of The Jerusalem Post in 1990, and was appointed editor in chief in 1992. He became widely known for his weekly column ""Eye on the Media,"" in which he was a harsh critic of United States news outlets' coverage of Israel and the Middle East.

 He was then selected to serve as Mr. Netanyahu's chief spokesman, and in that role emerged as a tough and sometimes acerbic advocate of Israeli policies.

 ""David Bar-Illan was an Israeli Zionist patriot in his whole being,"" Mr. Netanyahu said last night in a statement to The Jerusalem Post. ""He was an outstanding artist who sacrificed years of wonderful musical creativity to engage in journalistic and public activity to help his land and his people.""

 ""He was a Renaissance man with an international education and an amazing writer whose power was in his deep faith in the righteousness of our people.""

 Mr. Bar-Illan's role as spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu was not without controversy. In one embarrassing episode, widely reported in the United States and Israel, Mr. Bar-Illan was quoted in a 1998 article in The New Yorker making unflattering comments about his boss's wife, Sara Netanyahu.

 He was quoted as describing her as ""not the most stable woman in the world."" In the article, he was also quoted as commenting on infidelities by Mr. Netanyahu.

 ""One thing is to have an affair with a shiksa,"" a derogatory Yiddish term for a non-Jewish woman, ""but a married woman!"" the article quoted Mr. Bar-Illan as saying. He later said he had been misquoted, while The New Yorker said its quotes were accurate.

 Mr. Bar-Illan is survived by his wife, Beverly; three children, Kim, Daniela and Jeremy; and two stepsons, Anthony and Brian.","The New York Times                             November 5, 2003 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  David Bar-Illan, Ex-Israeli Aide, Dies at 73"
"Ralph Francis Salerno, a highly decorated New York City policeman and an authority on organized crime, died last Wednesday in Scranton, Pa. A former resident of Woodside, Queens, he was 78 and had lived in Lake Ariel, Pa., since 1988.",42806,2003-10-21 00:00:00,"Ralph Francis Salerno, a highly decorated New York City policeman and an authority on organized crime, died last Wednesday in Scranton, Pa. A former resident of Woodside, Queens, he was 78 and had lived in Lake Ariel, Pa., since 1988.

 The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.

 When Detective Sgt. Ralph Salerno retired from the Police Department in 1967, he took with him the reputation of knowing more about the Mafia in America than anybody not sworn into it, according to news accounts at the time. He spent more than 20 years in the department's intelligence branch and left as supervisor of detectives in the central investigations division.

 He was regularly summoned to testify as an expert witness on loan-sharking and sundry other criminal activities before both houses of Congress and in the federal and state courts.

 After his first retirement, he formally became a consultant to the Department of Justice in Washington and to the National Council on Crime and Delinquency.

 In 1970, Mayor John V. Lindsay and the city's Off-Track Betting Corporation picked him as special adviser to the corporation amid signs that criminal elements were trying to infiltrate or wreck legalized betting. Three years later, Mr. Salerno joined the Queens district attorney's office upon the election of Nicholas Ferraro, who chose him as his chief rackets investigator.

 Over the years, Mr. Salerno sat on presidential commissions, spoke frequently at public forums and lectured at universities across the United States and Canada. He contributed articles to magazines and wrote a book, ""The Crime Confederation"" (Doubleday, 1969).

 He retired from public service in 1975, after which he worked as a consultant in the private sector.

 Ralph Salerno was born in the Bronx to immigrants from the Naples area of Italy, the youngest of 11 children. He told of the family's flight from the Italian ghetto of East Harlem, on 109th Street, where gangsters had exacted tribute from storekeepers and enforced omerta -- the code of silence -- on residents.

 ""The story I remember best,"" he said of that era, ""is how two thugs came from the fire escape one evening as the family sat at dinner. They were fleeing from the police on the roof. The intruders whistled for silence. Then one looked into the hallway, which was clear, and the pair of them went out that way. My folks were too scared to do anything.

 ""The next time my father went to the barber shop, the barber handed him a package and said: 'A fellow left it for you. He said you'd know why.' It had a new razor, a brush and a mug ornamented in gold with the emblem of my father's union in the Sanitation Department. That's how well they knew everybody's business.""

 Such memories prompted him to become a policeman in 1946, determined to fight criminal associations that could cow a community with fear and small gifts. He was appointed a detective in 1950 and a sergeant 10 years later. Although he kept that rank, he became supervisor of detectives in the growing investigations bureau, with a lieutenant's pay.

 Mr. Salerno's wife of 50 years, Frances McKnight Salerno, died in 1997. He is survived by three sons, James G. of Woodside, Francis D. of Eugene, Ore., and Ralph P. of Glen Head, N.Y.; two brothers, Michael, of Utica, N.Y., and John, of Ballston Spa, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.

 In his police career, he was close to the investigations of some of the mob's most notorious figures. His unit used informants and surveillance as well as court-authorized wiretaps, which he considered indispensable.

 Such eavesdropping, he said, could tell investigators whether a missing mobster had made himself scarce or had been killed, merely by the tenses used in a conversation.

 Mr. Salerno's work led to the arrest of many criminals with Italian names. In an interview in The New York Times when he was near retirement as a policeman, he recalled a murder trial when a defendant's brother reproached him for hurting his own kind.

 ""I told him, 'I'm not your kind, and you're not my kind,' "" Mr. Salerno said. "" 'My manner, morals and mores are not yours. The only thing we have in common is that we both spring from an Italian heritage and culture -- and you are the traitor to that heritage and culture, which I am proud to be part of.'

"Richard C. Lee, the former mayor of New Haven whose urban renewal programs in the 1950's and 1960's earned national recognition and created a template for decades of future city revitalization projects, died on Sunday.",25506,2003-02-04 00:00:00,"Richard C. Lee, the former mayor of New Haven whose urban renewal programs in the 1950's and 1960's earned national recognition and created a template for decades of future city revitalization projects, died on Sunday. He was 86.

 Mr. Lee had suffered from diabetes and heart disease and was living most recently in a continuing care center near here.

 Mr. Lee, whose formal schooling ended when he graduated from Hillhouse High School in New Haven in 1934, was an intuitive, street-smart politician with a keen eye for public relations. He became the driving force behind many of the city's largest building projects.

 As mayor from 1954 to 1970, Mr. Lee, a Democrat, leveraged hundreds of millions of dollars from the state and federal governments to raze blighted city neighborhoods, feats documented in national magazines and newspapers.

 Under his leadership, a shopping center and a sports and music coliseum were built downtown, and a path was cleared for the construction of the Interstate highways that put his city at the crossroads of southern New England.

 ""More than any American mayor in that era, he made the best possible use of the federal and state laws that were then available for rebuilding a center city and improving the lives of its people,"" said Joel Cogen, executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, an organization that Mr. Lee founded in 1966.

 ""He had the vision to see that there were many things that the cities and towns could do better together than they could do separately,"" Mr. Cogen added. ""He had the leadership skills to bring them together and make it happen.""

 Richard Charles Lee was born on March, 12, 1916. He grew up in a cold-water apartment in the working-class Newhallville neighborhood. His father, Frederick, worked at the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.

 After high school, Mr. Lee took a job as a reporter with The New Haven Journal-Courier after bluffing his way through an interview.

 ""The newspaper editor asked Lee if he could type,"" said Raymond Wolfinger, a political science professor at the University of California at Berkeley who spent a year working at City Hall near Mayor Lee in 1957 and 1958. ""He said yes, which was a complete lie. But that was a Friday, and between Friday and Monday he borrowed a typewriter and taught himself typing.""

 At 21 he became a member of the Democratic Party. Soon he was elected an alderman and helped draft the first budget for the city's Planning Commission. After winning three more terms and, in 1943, after a medical discharge from the Army because of ulcers, Mr. Lee was hired by Yale University, first to handle its wartime news digest and later to head its public relations bureau. It was there that he learned to connect with people from every walk of life.

 ""Dick was always perfectly comfortable with people who had greater educations than he,"" said Robert A. Dahl, a Sterling professor of political science emeritus at Yale and author of a 1963 book, ""Who Governs? Democracy and Power in the American City,"" which documented the changes Mr. Lee was making in New Haven. ""You never felt that he was manipulating you. He was, probably, but he was always listening.""

 Mr. Lee is survived by his wife, Ellen Griffin Lee; two daughters, Sarah A. Lee and Tara Lee Croke; and a son, David Lee.

 After two failed mayoral campaigns -- the second of which he lost by two votes -- Mr. Lee beat the Republican mayor in 1954 and kept the job for 16 years, still a New Haven record. But New Haven was a city that was losing its industrial job base and whose inner city was expanding because of an influx of Southern blacks.

 One of his first actions was to convene a committee of residents to come up with ways to reinvent New Haven, a northeastern city that despite Mr. Lee's emphasis on redevelopment has continued to struggle with more than its share of poverty and unemployment.

 ""We are taking the town out of the 18th century and projecting it into the 21st,"" he once told his constituents. And if Mayor Lee was anything, his friends said, he was a pragmatist who knew who to get to know and how to get things done.

 In 1957, John F. Kennedy, then in the Senate, traveled to New Haven to campaign for Mr. Lee. To shore up New Haven's large Italian electorate, the mayor brought in Rocky Marciano, the boxer. He won that election by a two-to-one margin.

 By the end of the 1950's, New Haven was receiving far more federal aid per capita than any other city in in the county, Professor Wolfinger said.","The New York Times                              February 4, 2003 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Richard C.

"Earl King, the New Orleans rhythm-and-blues guitarist and singer who wrote songs that became Mardi Gras standards, died on Thursday in New Orleans, his lawyer said.",29820,2003-04-20 00:00:00,"Earl King, the New Orleans rhythm-and-blues guitarist and singer who wrote songs that became Mardi Gras standards, died on Thursday in New Orleans, his lawyer said. He was 69.

 The cause was complications related to diabetes, according to the lawyer, Greg Eveline..

 Mr. King, who lived in New Orleans, was a flamboyant performer, singing with bluesy ease and playing guitar solos that curled and sliced across the rolling New Orleans beat. He recorded hundreds of songs that were rooted in both the 12-bar blues and New Orleans lore, with lyrics that could tell wry, compressed stories or come up with wild-eyed imagery. ""Whatever gymnastics jump through my head, I write about it,"" he once said.

 While Mr. King performed widely, his songs also traveled by way of other musicians: Jimi Hendrix, who recorded Mr. King's ""Come On"" as ""Let the Good Times Roll"" on ""Electric Ladyland""; the Meters and Robert Palmer, who recorded Mr. King's ""Trick Bag;"" and Professor Longhair, who played piano and had the performer credit on the original 1964 version of Mr. King's ""Big Chief,"" although it featured Mr. King's vocals and whistling. The Professor Longhair recording and remakes of ""Big Chief"" by performers including Allen Toussaint and Dr. John are still heard every year at Mardi Gras time.

 Mr. King was born Earl Silas Johnson IV in New Orleans in 1934. He started performing as a gospel singer, but then turned to the blues, at first singing with the band led by Huey (Piano) Smith. He made his first single as Earl Johnson in the early 1950's, playing guitar in a style strongly influenced by Guitar Slim (Eddie Jones). When he signed to Specialty Records, the label's owner, Art Rupe, convinced him to bill himself as King Earl, but the typesetter reversed the names. As Earl King he had a regional hit, ""A Mother's Love,"" and then, after he moved to Ace Records, a national one with ""Those Lonely, Lonely Nights,"" which sold a reported 250,000 copies. His own recording of ""Trick Bag"" was a Top 20 rhythm-and-blues hit in 1962.

 Mr. King was signed to Motown Records in the early 1960's, but Motown never released any of his recordings.

 Back in New Orleans, he revived the career of Professor Longhair, a revered New Orleans pianist, with ""Big Chief"" in 1964, and his songs were also recorded by other New Orleans musicians including Lee Dorsey, Fats Domino and the Dixie Cups. Hendrix recorded ""Let the Good Times Roll"" for the 1968 ""Electric Ladyland,"" which provided significant royalties through the years for Mr. King; Stevie Ray Vaughan also recorded the song.

 During the 1980's and 90's, Mr. King made albums for Black Top Records, including a 1986 collaboration with the band Roomful of Blues, ""Glazed,"" which was named because he made a Tastee Donuts shop his regular office and hangout. ""Glazed"" was nominated for a Grammy Award. Mr. King followed it with ""Sexual Telepathy"" in 1990, ""Hard River to Cross"" in 1993 and ""New Orleans Street Talkin""' in 1997. Although declining health limited his performing in recent years, collections of his songs were released on Westside, Fuel 2000 and Charly Records.","The New York Times                               April 20, 2003 Sunday                               Late Edition - Final  Earl King, a Blues Guitarist Of New Orleans, Is Dead at 69"

 He died after a bout of pneumonia and had had several illnesses, including emphysema, cancer and congestive heart failure, said his son Steve Smylie, a state representative.

 Robert Smylie, who was first elected governor in 1954, helped moderate Republicans regroup after the defeat of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. Before his failed re-election bid in 1966, Mr. Smylie was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential nominee in 1968.

 It was Mr. Smylie's decision to support a 3-cent state sales tax in 1965 that helped round up the votes needed for it. In his autobiography, he wrote that his support for the tax was probably a major factor in his upset in the Republican primary in 1966.

 Still, he called the tax the most important legislative act in the state's first century, creating what policy makers called Idaho's three-legged stool of income, property and sales taxes.

 Mr. Smylie was born in Marcus, Iowa, in 1914 and saw Idaho for the first time as a student at the College of Idaho in Caldwell. He graduated in 1938 and earned a law degree at George Washington University in Washington.

 He spent the World War II years in the Coast Guard and married before returning to Idaho in 1947 to work as a deputy to Attorney General Robert Ailshie. He was appointed to replace Mr. Ailshie when Mr. Ailshie died that year. He was elected to a full four-year term in 1950 and was elected governor four years later.

Duryea, a Montauk lobsterman who became a commanding figure in New York politics during the 1960's and 1970's, ultimately losing the 1978 race for governor, died on Sunday at Southampton Hospital. He was 82.

 His son, Perry Duryea III, said Mr. Duryea died about 4:30 p.m. from injuries he suffered in a car accident near his Montauk home last Tuesday.

 Mr. Duryea, a Republican, was first elected to the State Assembly in 1960 and, with a family history in state politics, swiftly rose to the upper echelon of leadership and held on.

 He became the Assembly minority leader in 1966. He would remain a prominent figure in the Assembly until 1978, using his command positions to influence the pace and contents of legislation, keeping the ranks in line and doling out assignments and appointments.

 He was speaker from 1969 through 1973, and minority leader again from 1974 to 1978. (He reverted to minority leadership after the Watergate scandal deprived the Republicans of their majority in the Assembly.)

 Ruddy, silver-haired and standing 6-foot-2, Perry Belmont Duryea Jr. -- he dropped the junior after his father's death -- was born in Montauk. His was a family of lobstermen who controlled Perry Duryea & Son, a Montauk company of seafood wholesalers. Throughout his years in elective office, he remained a familiar figure in Montauk, often returning home to tend to the family concern, the well-tailored model of a successful businessman.

 It was a business that was acquired by his father in the early 1920's. Father and son shared an interest in politics, since the senior Mr. Duryea was a state senator.

 The younger Mr. Duryea forged close relations in Albany with Robert Moses and Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, and pushed through legislation that expanded state parks and the state university system. Mr. Duryea also headed the Long Island State Park Commission and championed construction of the Long Island Expressway and the Sunrise Highway extension.

 ""I never thought that the political life was supposed to be easy,"" he said in a 1977 interview, the year before running unsuccessfully for governor against Hugh L. Carey, the incumbent Democrat.

 ""Little in life is simple, especially politics, with its crosscurrents, reactions and personalities,"" he said.

 Mr. Duryea's political ascendancy was not without setbacks. He was indicted by a grand jury in 1973 for election law violations.

 The charges were later dropped, and Mr. Duryea received unusual support among his colleagues, with both Republican and Democratic legislators rising to his defense. But the episode helped sidetrack whatever aspirations he nursed at the time to succeed a fellow Republican, Mr. Rockefeller, in the governor's mansion in 1974.

 Instead, Mr. Rockefeller anointed his lieutenant governor, Malcolm Wilson, when he moved to Washington as Gerald Ford's vice president, and Mr. Wilson lost the governorship to Mr. Carey, the Democratic candidate that year in the aftermath of Watergate.

 Mr. Duryea was considered a conservative, but one with a mixed legislative record. He worked hard for environmental measures, a long-standing concern of his, even though he seldom came out in front on such issues.

 He wound up casting the tie-breaking vote to legalize abortion in New York, a risky move for a Republican at the time. On the other hand, he remained highly skeptical of the efforts made by others, like Mr. Rockefeller, to stave off bankruptcy for New York City in the 1970's.

 He left office after losing the 1978 election to Mr. Carey. But Mr. Carey, who had a home on the eastern end of Long Island, maintained a long friendship with Mr. Duryea.

 Mr. Duryea graduated from Colgate University and served in the United States Naval Transport Service as a plane commander during World War II, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander.

 Mr. Duryea's son said in a 1997 interview that his father ""never left Montauk again"" after the losing the race for governor. Once out of politics, he remained active in the family's lobster business and restaurant, as well as in Long Island banking.

 Besides his son, Mr. Duryea is survived by his wife, Marie Therese Duryea of Montauk; a daughter, Lynn Duryea of Huntsville, Tex.; and two grandchildren.

 The six-story State Office Building in Hauppauge, built in 1970, was rededicated to bear his name in October.

He was 81.

 General Sein Lwin had a reputation for being the brutal henchman of U Ne Win, the military dictator, and was best known for suppressing antigovernment activities. He led a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in 1988. Unconfirmed reports said hundreds of protesters were killed during his short time in office.

 An obituary in Myanma Ahlin did not give the cause of death. Family members said he was recently treated in Singapore for a stomach ailment, and returned Friday to Myanmar, formerly Burma, where he died the same day.

 General Sein Lwin, who retired from the army with the rank of brigadier general, made a name for himself in 1950 when he commanded the unit that killed the leader of a rebellion by the ethnic Karen minority.

 He ran various violent operations to stifle dissent, including the army unit that killed university students protesting General Ne Win's rule in 1962.

 He became president on July 27, 1988, but the pro-democracy protests grew. Instead of negotiating, he tried to end the protests by force.

 But he failed, and he resigned on Aug. 12, 1988.

 He is survived by his wife and seven children.","The New York Times                               April 12, 2004 Monday                               Late Edition - Final  U Sein Lwin, 81, Former Burmese Leader"
"Rambling Rudy Phillips, who spent his teenage years hopping freight trains to everywhere and nowhere and lived to become one of America's last and best-known Depression-era hobos, died on Jan. 9 in Harrisburg, Ill.",16394,2004-01-25 00:00:00,"Rambling Rudy Phillips, who spent his teenage years hopping freight trains to everywhere and nowhere and lived to become one of America's last and best-known Depression-era hobos, died on Jan. 9 in Harrisburg, Ill.

 He was 92 when he caught ""the westbound to heaven,"" in the time-honored hobo saying, his son Rudy said. He lived in a nursing home in Eldorado, Ill.

 In 1986, Mr. Phillips was crowned King of the Hobos at the National Hobo Convention in Britt, Iowa, an event that began in 1900 when a group of hobos from Chicago who called themselves Tourists Union No. 63 began convening there.

 Since 1933, the Britt Chamber of Commerce has sponsored what became an almost annual event as an allure to tourists. Rambling Rudy, like 44 kings before him and 17 after, was crowned with an empty coffee can.

 ""It was a great life,"" Mr. Phillips told the crowd in a speech that told of his confinement in 27 jails as he traveled the rails in 48 states for seven years, beginning when he was 14. ""I'd do it all over again.""

 Mr. Phillips seems to have convinced many that he was the last of the Depression-era hobos, but that was probably something of a stretch. When a third of America was out of work, historians have estimated, about four million people crisscrossed the country on freight trains in search of food, work or adventure. Some 250,000 of them were teenagers, a number of whom are undoubtedly still alive.

 When Lexy Lovell and Michael Uys started making their 1997 documentary film, ""Riding the Rails,"" they solicited responses from the former ""road kids,"" and said they received 3,000 answers from across the United States.

 But Mr. Phillips sought and received exceptional attention for his long-ago exploits by maintaining a free hobo museum in a shed in the backyard of his home in Shawneetown, Ill., and by making speeches and giving interviews. He was good at telling stories, for example his account of arriving at one of the country's largest hobo encampments, or jungles.

 ""I got there about sundown, half-starved, and, before my eyes on the American River, I could see thousands of campfires,"" he said in an interview with The Evansville Courier and Press in 1999. ""I went to the nearest hobo jungle and smelled something cooking.""

 In his later life, he passed out cards defining a hobo as a man who travels to work; a tramp as a man who travels and won't work, and a bum as a man who won't work. Those are definitions that most hobos accept, but the derivation of the word hobo is murkier. Many etymologists trace it back to the days after the Civil War when traveling men carried hoes with them, and hence were called ""hoe boys.""

 What is clear is that the romance of jumping freights digs deep into the American psyche, a rolling romance nourished by a number of writers, including Mark Twain, Zane Grey and John Steinbeck, who called hobos ""the last free men.""

 Rudolph W. Phillips was born in East Prairie, Mo., on Aug. 28, 1911, and had early memories of his mother giving meals to hobos.

 In 1925, when he was 14, Rudy decided on the first day of eighth grade that he had had enough of school. He tried working in a mill, but the job lasted only half a day when he became sick from chewing tobacco. He told his parents he was going to St. Louis to look for work.

 He first hitchhiked, whizzing through St. Louis, but soon came to prefer trains. His father wrote a note, either to keep him out of jail or make sure he was not sent home.

 ""He is not running away,"" the note said. ""He is just seeing the world.""

 Rudy saw plenty. He learned to drink coffee from rusty lard cans and did jobs from picking fruit to ""pearl-diving,"" the hobos' term for washing dishes. He listened to the wail of a harmonica in a swaying boxcar. He ran from ""bulls,"" as the dreaded railroad detectives were known; carried a Hoover blanket, or newspaper, in his back pocket; and, all things considered, spent less time in jail than he might have.

 ""I had a smooth line of talk,"" he said in an interview with The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 1989, ""and the police said I had an honest face.""

 Mr. Phillips left the road in 1932 and set up a sandwich stand that became Rudy's Barbecue. He operated it until his retirement in 1987. He was married seven times, experiences he described to The Post-Dispatch as shipwrecks on the Sea of Matrimony.

 ""He once told me that he went to the bank in Shawneetown and told the banker he needed $4,000 to pay off wife No. 3, divorce wife No. 4 and marry wife No. 5,"" his son said.

 He was married to his last wife, Hazel, for more than 30 years, until her recent death. Besides his son Rudy, who lives in Harrisburg, Mr. Phillips is survived by four other sons, Glenn of Shawneetown; Rudy Joe, of Rudement, Ill., Ed, of Harrisburg, and Bruce, of Fairdealing, Mo., as well as five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

 For all his clowning with the old-time hobos in Britt, Rambling Rudy did not sugarcoat his memories.

 ""For every mile of beautiful scenery and warm sunshine, there are hundreds of miles of cold, dark nights, no food and no one to care whether I live or die,"" he wrote in his 1988 book, ""Hobo King.""","The New York Times                              January 25, 2004 Sunday                               Late Edition - Final  Rambling Rudy Phillips, 92, Onetime King of Hobos"

Shaker, a former chairman and chief executive of the Arbitron Ratings Company, died on Wednesday in New Canaan, Conn. He was 83 and lived in Darien, Conn.

 The cause was complications of a fractured hip, his family said; he also had Parkinson's disease.

 Mr. Shaker worked for two decades in network television before becoming chief executive of Arbitron, a television and radio ratings company, in 1971. The company was then called the American Research Bureau, but Mr. Shaker changed the name after hearing that it could alienate minorities, said Thom Mocarsky, a spokesman for Arbitron. Mr. Shaker made representing the opinions of blacks and Hispanics a priority at Arbitron, Mr. Mocarsky said.

 During Mr. Shaker's 17 years at Arbitron, the company grew from revenue of $10 million a year to $150 million a year, Mr. Mocarsky said. One of Mr. Shaker's projects in the 1980's, ScanAmerica, which sought to link consumers' purchases with the advertisements they saw, has resurfaced this year in a pilot program called Project Apollo at Arbitron, Mr. Mocarsky said.

 ''The technology wasn't up to the task, but the concept has come back here at Arbitron,'' he said.

 Mr. Shaker worked for CBS in the 1950's and for ABC in the 1960's, eventually overseeing the film, international, spot sales and television station divisions as group vice president.

 His death was announced by Gordon E. Michalson Jr., the college's current president.

 Mr. Baughman, a former treasurer of New York University, returned to his native Florida in 1961 to help establish New College in Sarasota as a privately financed school of liberal arts and sciences. It was intended to attract gifted students by setting high standards, and its waterfront campus was intended to bridge the cultures of North America and Latin America.

 Mr. Baughman and the trustees built the school on the former Charles Ringling estate, raising money for land, buildings and scholarship endowments. Mr. Baughman oversaw the transformation of the 115-acre estate into a campus after I.M. Pei won an architectural competition over rivals like Louis I. Kahn and Eero Saarinen Associates.

 Mr. Baughman recruited much of the faculty so the first class could enter in 1964. He put into effect the original curriculum, characterized by a high degree of student responsibility for passing muster in faculty evaluations and based somewhat on the Oxford model.

 Mr. Baughman served as president until 1965, after which he headed the New College Foundation for several years before moving to Gainesville. The college merged with the state university system in 1975 and became affiliated with the University of South Florida, retaining its autonomy and academic standards.

 George Baughman was born in Tampa and received a bachelor's degree in science in 1937 and a law degree in 1939 from the University of Florida. He studied at the American Institute of Banking in Washington, received an M.A. degree at George Washington University and returned to the University of Florida as an associate professor in 1941.

 In World War II he was commissioned into the Navy and traveled widely overseas for the Lend-Lease program. He remained in the Naval Reserve and eventually retired with the rank of rear admiral.

 After the war, he was appointed vice president for business affairs at the University of Florida, a post he held until 1955, when he was named business manager by N.Y.U. There he rose to treasurer and vice president for business affairs.

"William O. Baker, a prominent scientist and a former head of Bell Laboratories who advised five presidents on scientific affairs, died on Monday in Chatham, N.J.",37910,2005-11-03 00:00:00,"William O. Baker, a prominent scientist and a former head of Bell Laboratories who advised five presidents on scientific affairs, died on Monday in Chatham, N.J. He was 90 and had lived in Morristown, N.J., for many years.

 The cause was heart failure, his son, Joseph, said.

 Trained as a physical chemist, Mr. Baker was president of Bell Labs from 1973 to 1979; he retired in 1980 as chairman of the board. Based in Murray Hill, N.J., Bell Labs is now the research and development arm of Lucent Technologies.

 During Mr. Baker's tenure as president, Bell Labs scientists twice won the Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1977 Phillip W. Anderson shared the prize with two other scientists for research into the electronic structure of glass and magnetic materials. The next year Arno A. Penzias and Robert W. Wilson shared the prize with a third scientist for discovering background radiation in space believed to have been left over from the Big Bang.

 William Oliver Baker was born on July 15, 1915, in Chestertown, Md., and grew up on his family's 400-acre farm on the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay. His mother raised turkeys -- her Baker's Bronze Beauties were a famous local brand -- and her adroit use of chemicals to combat parasites may have set her son on his professional course.

 Mr. Baker earned a bachelor's degree in physical chemistry from Washington College in Chestertown in 1935 and a Ph.D. from Princeton in 1938. The next year he joined Bell Labs, then Bell Telephone Laboratories, as a research scientist. In World War II, his work there contributed to the development of synthetic rubber.

 In 1948 Mr. Baker was named the head of polymer research and development at the laboratory. He was later assistant director of chemical and metallurgical research and director of physical sciences research there. He was the lab's vice president of research from 1955 to 1973.

 As an adviser to Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Reagan, Mr. Baker was consulted on a variety of scientific issues, including the technology of information gathering. He was for many years a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and the Federal Emergency Management Advisory Board.

 He received 11 patents for his own research, which focused on the crystalline molecular structure of various materials, including plastics and natural rubber. He also received the National Medal of Science in 1988.

Mr. Reeves, widely considered one of the premier equestrian artists in the world, was 85 and made his home in Greenport.

 Mr. Reeves's daughter, Nina Stone Reeves, confirmed the death.

 Commissioned by leading owners and breeders around the world, Mr. Reeves painted more than a thousand of the finest thoroughbreds in a career that began in the late 1940's. His roster of subjects read like a Who's Who of horseflesh: Affirmed, Buckpasser, Cigar, Dark Star, Forego, Genuine Risk, John Henry, Kelso, Nijinsky II, Northern Dancer, Ruffian, Seattle Slew, Secretariat, Spectacular Bid.

 His list of patrons, equally impressive, included W. Averell Harriman, Paul Mellon, Allaire duPont, Harry Guggenheim and the Aga Khan. In 1982 President Ronald Reagan presented Queen Elizabeth II with a special edition of Mr. Reeves's book ''Decade of Champions'' (1980), which included a commissioned watercolor by him of the queen's champion racehorse Dunfermline.

 Done in oil on canvas, Mr. Reeves's paintings were neo-Romantic in style, setting sleek-coated muscular horses against pastoral backgrounds. Sometimes he included the jockey in his gleaming silks, and over the course of his career Mr. Reeves captured some of the best riders in the world, among them Ron Turcotte, Lester Piggott and Bill Shoemaker.

 Mostly in private hands, Mr. Reeves's work is part of the permanent collection of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and was widely reproduced in newspapers and magazines. He declined to disclose his fees publicly, but in 1997, Town & Country magazine reported that his paintings started at $25,000.

 Richard Stone Reeves was born in Manhattan on Nov. 6, 1919. He had a strong pedigree: his father, Matthew Sully Reeves, was a descendant of the 19th-century American portraitist Thomas Sully. His mother, the former Edna Simonson, kept standardbred horses. Richard was raised in Garden City, on Long Island, conveniently near Belmont Park.

 Mr. Reeves earned a bachelor's degree in art from Syracuse University in 1941, and during World War II was a naval intelligence officer in China. One of his superior officers there noticed him sketching and, learning of Mr. Reeves's passion for horses, offered to help him out when the war was over. He introduced himself as Bob Johnson, president of Roosevelt Raceway.

 ''I thought he had seen too much war and was suffering from battle fatigue,'' Mr. Reeves told The New York Times in 1972. ''But after the war I looked him up, and he was president of Roosevelt Raceway.''

 Among Mr. Reeves's early works was a portrait of Armed, the 1947 horse of the year. After the painting was featured in Life magazine in 1948, commissions poured in. A longtime resident of Oldwick, N.J., Mr. Reeves maintained his studio in a converted barn on his property there, traveling the world to make preliminary drawings of his subjects in their natural surroundings.

 Besides his daughter, of Manhattan, Mr. Reeves is survived by his wife, the former Martha Seymour; a son, Tony, of Basking Ridge, N.J.; and a brother, Robert L., of Olympia, Wash.","The New York Times                             October 12, 2005 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  Richard Stone Reeves, Painter Of Racehorses, Is Dead at 85"
"Bernard Kilbourn, New York's first Republican state chairman in the fractious post-Rockefeller era, died on June 29 at his home in Port Jervis, N. Y.",48945,2005-07-07 00:00:00,"Bernard Kilbourn, New York's first Republican state chairman in the fractious post-Rockefeller era, died on June 29 at his home in Port Jervis, N. Y. He was 81.

 His death was announced by the Gray-Parker Funeral Home in Port Jervis.

 Dr. Kilbourn, a dentist by profession in Chadwicks, N.Y., at the time, was elected party chairman in 1977, after many years in which the state party had been dominated by Nelson A. Rockefeller, governor of New York from 1959 to 1973.

 A former Oneida County chairman, Dr. Kilbourn was an effective organizer, soft-spoken and methodical, who scolded New York Republicans for having ''developed bad habits'' by becoming dependent on Mr. Rockefeller's financial support and letting its organization become lax. His remedy was to carve the party into regions with vice chairmen who would actively get out the vote and raise money.

 He gave up his dental practice to work full time for the party. But Mr. Rockefeller's departure from the scene, and the defeat of his successor as governor, Malcolm Wilson, had splintered the party, and in the 1978 elections, Hugh L. Carey became the first Democratic governor to win re-election in 40 years.

 In 1979, Dr. Kilbourn organized an ambitious fund-raising effort. As New York Republican support for Ronald Reagan grew in the 1980 campaign, Dr. Kilbourn hoped to keep the state delegation to the national convention uncommitted, but he failed, and the delegation went to the convention with 91 of its members committed to Mr. Reagan. He helped run the state campaign for Mr. Reagan, however, and was re-elected to the state chairmanship in September 1980.

 After the Reagan victory, Dr. Kilbourn was named regional director of the Department of Health and Human Services for New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, a post he held from 1981 to 1989.

 Bernard Mason Kilbourn was born in Sauquoit, N.Y., on Feb. 13, 1924. He served in the Army in World War II and in the Korean War. After World War II, he graduated from Hamilton College and went to the New York University Dental School. He practiced dentistry in Chadwicks, N.Y., from 1953 until 1977.

 Dr. Kilbourn is survived by his wife, Dorothy Stevens Kilbourn; four sons, Mason, of Staunton, Va.; Wayne, of Denver; Bruce, of Nashville; and Charles Strong of Utica; five daughters, Denise Eagan of Schenectady, N.

"Red Auerbach, who built the Boston Celtics into one of the greatest dynasties in sports, presiding over 16 National Basketball Association championship teams as a coach, general manager and club president, died yesterday in the Washington area.",55854,2006-10-29 00:00:00,"Red Auerbach, who built the Boston Celtics into one of the greatest dynasties in sports, presiding over 16 National Basketball Association championship teams as a coach, general manager and club president, died yesterday in the Washington area. He was 89.

 His death was announced by the Celtics. The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.

 Auerbach had a relentless will to win and he was a supreme judge of talent. He was a combative figure who always sought an edge, whether taunting his foes by lighting premature victory cigars on the bench or going jaw to jaw with the referees. He was a presence in pro basketball for 60 years, his coaching career stretching back to the birth of the N.B.A.

 Auerbach coached the Celtics to nine N.B.A. championships, eight of them consecutively from 1959 to 1966. He built another six championship teams as the Celtics' general manager and oversaw a final one, in 1986, as the team's president, a position he held at the time of his death.

 When Auerbach turned over the Celtics' coaching position to his star center Bill Russell in 1966, after 20 seasons as an N.B.A. coach and 16 of them in Boston, he was No. 1 in career victories with a record of 938-479. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969 and he was named the greatest coach in N.B.A. history by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980. His nine championships as a coach have been equaled only by Phil Jackson, who won three with the Los Angeles Lakers and six with the Chicago Bulls.

 Auerbach was also a pioneer in race relations. In 1950, his first season coaching the Celtics, he chose Chuck Cooper of Duquesne University as the first black player selected in an N.B.A. draft. In the 1963-64 season, the Celtics became the first N.B.A. team to start a game with an all-black lineup: Russell, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones, Tom Sanders and Willie Naulls.

 When Auerbach named Russell as his coaching successor, it was the first time a black had become coach of a major American pro sports team.

 A Brooklyn native, Auerbach took his place among the historic figures of New England on his 68th birthday, when a life-size statue of him was unveiled in Boston's Faneuil Hall. Auerbach's book ''Basketball for the Player, the Fan and the Coach,'' written in the early 1950s, has been widely translated.

 Auerbach was consumed by a quest to excel on the basketball court. It brought him something of a lonely existence. Because his wife, Dorothy, and their two daughters remained at the Auerbachs' home in Washington during the long basketball winters, family life seldom encroached on his single-minded devotion to the sport.

 ''The game was my livelihood, my whole guts,'' he said in ''Red Auerbach: An Autobiography,'' written with Joe Fitzgerald. As he put it: ''I had to win. I wanted to be good in whatever I did. I wanted to be the very best teacher I possibly could be. I wanted to be the very best player I could possibly be. And I wanted to be the very best coach I could possibly be. Could I be a good coach and lose? To me, that's like asking if a guy can be a good doctor even though his patients keep dying.''

 Auerbach was often crusty and left no question as to who was the boss, although he considered his players' suggestions on strategy. Insisting on team play over individual goals, he created an aura around the Celtics perhaps matched in American sports only by the Yankee mystique.

 ''He wanted everybody to know that when they put on a Celtics uniform, they were part of a tradition, something that was worth working for,'' Wayne Embry, a former Celtics center and later an N.B.A. coach and executive, once told The Chicago Tribune. ''He'd bark and growl at his players, but there was always a reason for it, and they got the message. On the Celtics, you accepted your role and took pride in being the best.''

 Arnold Jacob Auerbach was born Sept. 20, 1917, in Brooklyn. His father was an immigrant from Russia who ran a dry-cleaning business. Everyone called him Red from the days when he helped in the family business. A 5-foot-10 guard, he played basketball at Eastern District High School, then played for George Washington University.

 His college coach, Bill Reinhart, who taught a fast-break style that few teams used in those days, proved to be a major influence on his tactics. Auerbach was soon teaching the game, coaching high school basketball in Washington.

 After serving in the Navy during World War II, Auerbach made his pro coaching debut with the 1946-47 Washington Capitols in the inaugural season of the Basketball Association of America, the forerunner of the N.B.A. He coached the Capitols to the Eastern Division title with a 49-11 regular-season record, although the Philadelphia Warriors won the league championship. After three seasons with the Capitols, Auerbach coached the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, a team based in Illinois, for a season.

 In 1950, Walter Brown, the founder and owner of the Celtics, an original N.B.A. franchise but a floundering team with little fan support, hired Auerbach as coach and gave him full authority over the basketball operations. Boston was a baseball and a hockey town, the Red Sox and the Bruins dominating the sports scene at a time when pro basketball was a poor relation to the college game.

 Auerbach got off to a shaky start with the Boston news media and many local college basketball fans when he passed up a chance to select Bob Cousy, a star guard at Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., in the 1950 draft. He dismissed Cousy as a ''local yokel'' whose ball-handling brilliance clashed with his concepts of team play.

 But Cousy became a Celtic when his Chicago Stags team folded before the season and Auerbach had to take him in a dispersal arrangement. Auerbach's basketball acumen now began to pay off. He helped Cousy harness his talents, developing him into the rookie of the year. Cousy soon became a fan attraction rivaling only George Mikan, the Minneapolis Lakers center.

 Auerbach picked up Ed Macauley, a fine frontcourt shooter, and he molded teams that went to the playoffs for six straight seasons. He had turned the Celtics' fortunes around, but the team lacked one key ingredient -- a center who could snare rebounds to touch off fast breaks while frustrating opposing shooters with stifling defense.

 Auerbach got his man when he worked a deal with the St. Louis Hawks to enable him to draft Russell in 1956 out of the University of San Francisco. Russell's athleticism at a position formerly dominated by slow, plodding types complemented Cousy's passing and shooting and the offensive skills of guard Bill Sharman, propelling the Celtics into a dynasty.

 The Celtics won their first championship in 1957. Then, after losing to the Hawks in the 1958 finals, they won eight championships in a row.

 ''Well, there was a lot of luck involved,'' Cousy told Jeff Greenfield in ''The World's Greatest Team: A Portrait of the Boston Celtics, 1957-69.''

 Cousy, among the few people who referred to Auerbach as anything but Red, added: ''But Arnold directed that luck. I give him much more credit for what he did after he won the first few championships than before. At the start of every year, the guys, particularly those who had been through the losing years, knew what it meant to win. And each year, they wanted it again and again.''

 Russell paid tribute to Auerbach's ability to handle his players as individuals while blending them into a speedy and defensively aggressive team. ''Red had the greatest of ears,'' Russell told USA Today in 2004. ''After he talked to a player four times, he knew how to communicate with him. And that's important. And you can't treat everybody the same. If you treated everybody the same, they'd all get the same salary.

 ''Each year after I got in shape, Red didn't have me scrimmage anymore. He said he's not going to play me 46 minutes a game and wear me out in practice, too. So when we started scrimmaging, I'd go sit on the scorer's table and drink tea.''

 As John Havlicek put it in his foreword to Auerbach's autobiography: ''His greatest talent was knowing how to handle men, and how to react to any game situation. He would curse us, coddle us, maybe even enrage us. Anything he thought would make us perform better.''

 Auerbach's combativeness bedeviled the referees. Game program in hand, he would harangue officials like Sid Borgia and Mendy Rudolph. In a 1963 Celtics-Knicks matchup, Rudolph slapped three technical fouls on Auerbach and threw him out. Auerbach retaliated by ordering his team off the floor for a while. And that was in an exhibition game.

 Before a game in the 1957 finals in St. Louis, Auerbach angered the Hawks' owner, Ben Kerner, who charged at him when the Celtics measured the height of the baskets to make sure they were within regulations. Auerbach won that dust-up by punching Kerner in the mouth.

 Auerbach relished enraging opposing owners, coaches and players by lighting up his victory cigar in the closing moments of a game the Celtics had put away. Cousy once remembered how ''Paul Seymour and Alex Hannum used to tell me they didn't care about the N.B.A. championship; they just wanted to squash Arnold's cigar.''

 With Auerbach concentrating solely on his general manager's role, the Celtics won N.B.A. championships in 1968, '69, '74, '76, '81 and '84. One of his greatest coups was exploiting a loophole to draft Larry Bird in 1978, when Bird was a junior at Indiana State, still a year away from the N.B.A. His last championship team as general manager featured Bird, Robert Parish and Kevin McHale.

 Auerbach relinquished day-to-day control of the Celtics before the 1984-85 season, turning the general manager's role over to his assistant, Jan Volk, but retaining the club presidency he had held for the previous decade and a half. The Celtics captured the N.B.A. championship in 1986, but they have not won a league title since.

 Auerbach is survived by his daughters, Nancy Auerbach Collins and Randy Auerbach, a granddaughter and three great-grandchildren. His wife, Dorothy, died in 2000.

 In January 1985, Auerbach was honored at Boston Garden. Some 40 Celtics from four decades of Auerbach teams surrounded him in a circle on the parquet floor, and a banner was hoisted with a symbolic No. 2. (Banner No. 1 was for Walter Brown.)

 Tom Heinsohn, a former star forward who often incurred Auerbach's wrath, noticed a large sound system on the court set up for the ceremony. Heinsohn exclaimed, ''They need a sound system for him?''","The New York Times                              October 29, 2006 Sunday                               Late Edition - Final  Red Auerbach, Who Built Basketball Dynasty, Dies at 89"
"Sir Edward Ford, a royal courtier who provided Queen Elizabeth II with the memorable phrase ''annus horribilis'' to describe her troubles in 1992, died Sunday.",55949,2006-11-23 00:00:00,"Sir Edward Ford, a royal courtier who provided Queen Elizabeth II with the memorable phrase ''annus horribilis'' to describe her troubles in 1992, died Sunday. He was 96.

 His death was announced by his family in a notice published Tuesday in The Times of London.

 Sir Edward joined the palace staff in 1946 and was the queen's assistant private secretary from her accession in 1952 until he retired in 1967.

 In a letter to the queen in 1992, after the collapse of the marriages of Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne, and a devastating fire at Windsor Castle, Sir Edward turned to Latin to commiserate with her at the end of a ''horrible year.''

 Elizabeth used the phrase in a speech in November of that year marking the 40th anniversary of her reign, saying: ''1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure. In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an 'annus horribilis.' I suspect that I am not alone in thinking it so.''

 Edward Ford was educated at Eton and Oxford. One of his first jobs was as a private tutor to the heir to the Egyptian throne, Prince Farouk, who was then 15.

 He practiced law from 1937 to 1939, and during World War II he served in the military in Tunisia and Italy.

 His wife, Virginia, died in 1995. He is survived by two sons and a stepson.","The New York Times                             November 23, 2006 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Edward Ford, 96; Turned Phrase for Queen"
"C. Frederick Mosteller, the founding chairman of Harvard's statistics department and a pioneer in using statistics to analyze an array of topics as disparate as anesthesia, presidential elections and baseball, died on Sunday in Virginia.",13906,2006-07-27 00:00:00,"C. Frederick Mosteller, the founding chairman of Harvard's statistics department and a pioneer in using statistics to analyze an array of topics as disparate as anesthesia, presidential elections and baseball, died on Sunday in Virginia. He was 89.

 The cause of death was sepsis, said his son, William.

 From Dr. Mosteller's earliest research, he ventured where few statisticians had gone before. During World War II, he calculated the dispersion pattern of a string of bombs. After the 1948 presidential election, he was a member of a committee that looked into how presidential pre-election polls erroneously forecast Thomas E. Dewey as the winner over Harry S. Truman, finding that pollsters' data had contained signs that the election would be close and that their analysis of the data had included unproven assumptions.

 In the late 1950's, Dr. Mosteller assisted in analyzing data from a large clinical study looking at the anesthetic halothane, which was suspected of causing fatal liver damage in some patients. The analysis showed no evidence that halothane was more dangerous than other forms of anesthesia.

 He worked with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a professor of government at Harvard and later a senator from New York, on studies looking at the impact of home life on children's performance in school. They argued that raising families out of poverty would have a greater educational impact than pouring money directly into schools.

 Dr. Mosteller also appeared on national television in 1961, teaching a course on statistics on NBC's early morning program ''Continental Classroom.''

 In 1962 he stepped into a question of prose. Scholars disagreed on who -- James Madison or Alexander Hamilton -- was the author of a dozen of the essays in the Federalist Papers, articles published anonymously in 1787 and 1788 that described how the fledgling United States government was to work. Analyzing the frequency of certain words -- like ''upon,'' which Hamilton used frequently and Madison hardly at all -- Dr. Mosteller and David L. Wallace of the University of Chicago concluded that Madison wrote all 12.

 In the 1970's, Dr. Mosteller worked on studies that questioned whether the benefits of some surgical procedures were worth their costs. In the 1980's, he was instrumental in persuading Tennessee to conduct a controlled study on the effect of classroom size. The study showed convincingly that smaller classes significantly helped children from poorer minority families.

 In his half-century career at Harvard, Dr. Mosteller served as chairman of four departments.

 ''He was a remarkably disciplined scholar,'' said James Ware, the dean for academic affairs at Harvard, ''and he really knew how to share with other people.''

 Charles Frederick Mosteller was born in Clarksburg, W.Va., on Dec. 24, 1916. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the forerunner of Carnegie Mellon University. He received a doctorate in mathematics from Princeton in 1946.

 He then joined Harvard as a lecturer in the social relations department. After being promoted to professor in 1951, he became acting chairman of the department in 1953.

 At that time, Harvard had nine statistics professors, and they were scattered among different departments. In 1957, the university created a statistics department, and Dr. Mosteller was its first chairman.

 ''Harvard literally created a department for Fred,'' said Richard Light, an education professor at Harvard who was one of Dr. Mosteller's graduate students.

 In the 1970's, Dr. Mosteller was chairman of the biostatistics department at the Harvard School of Public Health, and in the 1980's he was chairman of the health policy and management department. After retiring in 1987, he continued to work as an emeritus professor until he moved to Virginia two years ago.

 In addition to his son William, of Falls Church, Va., Dr. Mosteller is survived by his daughter, Gale Mosteller of Arlington, Va.; and a grandson. His wife, Virginia Gilroy Mosteller, with whom he shared streetcar rides in Pittsburgh and married in 1941, died in 2000.

 In 1952, he published one of his best-known articles, ''The World Series Competition,'' in The Journal of the American Statistical Association. That work, inspired by the Boston Red Sox's loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946, was the first known academic paper looking at the statistics of baseball. Dr. Mosteller showed that the stronger team -- the one with a higher winning percentage -- would still often lose a series to a weaker team, simply because of chance.

 ''There should be no confusion here,'' he wrote, ''between the 'winning team' and the 'better team.'

"Ruth S. Morgenthau, a former professor of international politics at Brandeis University and an adviser to President Jimmy Carter on rural development in poor countries, died on Saturday in Boston.",55905,2006-11-12 00:00:00,"Ruth S. Morgenthau, a former professor of international politics at Brandeis University and an adviser to President Jimmy Carter on rural development in poor countries, died on Saturday in Boston. She was 75 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.

 The death was confirmed by her daughter, Sarah Morgenthau Wessel.

 An advocate of ''bottom-up'' aid to farmers and villagers in the third world, Mrs. Morgenthau was the Adlai Stevenson Professor Emeritus of International Politics at Brandeis, where she taught from 1963 to 2003. She also founded the university's graduate program in international sustainable development.

 ''She combined academic expertise with a practitioner's reality and, in the process, became one of the acknowledged experts in the world on development issues,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, a senior official in the Carter and Clinton administrations. ''She really helped shape President Carter's thinking on making Africa a priority for his administration.''

 In 1982, Mrs. Morgenthau and Robert Hecht, then a postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis, wrote an Op-Ed article for The New York Times asserting that the ''top-down'' approach to aid in Africa did not work because bureaucracies ''soak up resources.''

 ''With the bottom-up approach,'' the article said, ''villagers' skills, tools and limited savings can be fully mobilized, and relatively small foreign aid contributions flow directly into rural communities.'' Mrs. Morgenthau put that approach to work as chairwoman of Pact, a coalition with aid programs in 20 nations.

 Ruth Schachter Morgenthau was born in Vienna on Jan. 26, 1931. Her parents, Osias and Mizia Kramer Schachter, owned a textile importing company until they fled from the Nazis in 1940.

 In addition to her daughter, of Montclair, N.J., Mrs. Morgenthau is survived by her husband of 44 years, Henry Morgenthau III, a television producer and author whose father was treasury secretary in the Roosevelt administration. She is also survived by two sons, H. Ben, of San Francisco, and Kramer, of Los Angeles; a sister, Alice Barzilay of Manhattan; and three grandchildren. Her brother-in-law, Robert M. Morgenthau, is the Manhattan district attorney.

 Mrs. Morgenthau graduated from Barnard College in 1952, then attended the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris as a Fulbright scholar. In 1958, she received a doctorate in politics from Oxford. In 1964, she wrote ''Political Parties in French-Speaking West Africa'' (Oxford University Press). She was a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations, and in 1988 ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for Congress in Rhode Island.

 Last year, Mrs. Morgenthau was a member of a committee created by the Center for Global Development, a Washington research group, to assess the danger posed by poor nations. Mr. Eizenstat, who also worked on the committee, said she was a prime shaper of the report and had emphasized that aid was central to American security because poor nations were becoming havens for terrorists and criminals.","The New York Times                              November 12, 2006 Sunday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Ruth S.

"James O. Freedman, a former president of Dartmouth College and the University of Iowa and a forceful voice against anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance on college campuses, died yesterday at his home in Cambridge, Mass.",30868,2006-03-22 00:00:00,"James O. Freedman, a former president of Dartmouth College and the University of Iowa and a forceful voice against anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance on college campuses, died yesterday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 70.

 He died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, his son, Jared, said.

 Mr. Freedman was a strong advocate for a liberal education in an increasingly career-oriented world, but he gained his widest attention for speaking out against strains of prejudice and bigotry in the academic world.

 In one widely publicized episode, in 1988, he condemned The Dartmouth Review, a conservative student newspaper, for ridiculing blacks, gay men and lesbians, women and Jews. In a column and a front-page cartoon, the paper had portrayed Mr. Freedman, who was Jewish, with a Hitler mustache and wearing a Nazi uniform and had likened the effects of his campus policies to the Holocaust.

 Mr. Freedman defended The Review's right to publish, but he declared, ''Racism, sexism and other forms of ignorance and disrespect have no place at Dartmouth.''

 He spoke on a similar theme in 1997, at the dedication of a Dartmouth center for Jewish students. In a widely reported speech, he recounted a history of anti-Semitism at Dartmouth and other elite colleges, quoting, among others, a former Dartmouth president who had described the college's interest in the ''Christianization of its students.'' Mr. Freedman assured the audience that such language was a thing of the past, and that Jewish students had ''a proud place at Dartmouth today.''

 Five years later he helped gather the signatures of more than 300 college presidents in issuing a joint statement calling for ''intimidation-free'' campuses. The statement grew out of incidents in which Jewish students were reported to have been harassed and intimidated at student rallies protesting the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians. The statement drew some criticism, however, for focusing only on Jewish students.

 Beneath the public persona, Mr. Freedman was a consummate intellectual, addicted to buying books and losing himself in them. His collection exceeded 6,000 volumes, some piled in towers in the study of his home near the Dartmouth campus, in Hanover, N.H.

 James Oliver Freedman traced his love of reading to his youth in Manchester, N.H. When he was 15, he recalled, he was spending a summer washing dishes in a hospital, a job he found exhausting and boring. So his father, Louis Freedman, a high school English teacher, said he could quit on one condition: that he spend the rest of the summer reading.

 He started with Sinclair Lewis and W. Somerset Maugham, and was hooked. His father and his mother, Sophie Freedman, a bookkeeper at a bank, pushed him to attend Harvard.

 ''To their generation of New England Jews, Harvard represented the most exalted educational opportunity available and the most reliable vehicle of upward social mobility,'' he wrote in ''Idealism and Liberal Education,'' a collection of his essays published in 1996 by University of Michigan Press.

 Mr. Freedman entered Harvard in 1953, then moved on to Harvard Law School. But he was unhappy and dropped out, returning home to work for the Manchester newspaper, The Union Leader, as a copy boy and reporter.

 Two years later he tried law school again, this time at Yale, and went on to clerk for Thurgood Marshall, who was a Federal Appeals Court judge in New York at the time.

 After working briefly at a New York law firm, Mr. Freedman turned to academia, starting as an assistant law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He later became associate provost and dean of the law school.

 In 1982, the University of Iowa tapped him as president, a post he held for five years.

 When Dartmouth recruited him, in 1987, he became the first president of the college since 1822 not to have been a student or faculty member there. His mission, he wrote in ''Idealism and Liberal Education,'' was to shore up the intellectual reputation of a college known for being ''inhospitable to women, fraternity-oriented, unintellectual, ultraconservative and especially congenial for 'jocks.' ''

 In his inaugural address, he declared his intention to make Dartmouth more attractive to students who took pleasure in ''the lonely acts of writing poetry or mastering the cello or solving mathematical riddles or translating Catullus.''

 When he stepped down in 1998, a professor of religion at Dartmouth, Susan Ackerman, said he had ''upped the intellectual ante'' at the college.

 ''The students are brighter and brighter, and now they're not afraid to admit that they're bright,'' said Professor Ackerman, who was quoted in a New York Times article. ''He's made it O.K. to talk about books and ideas.''

 Mr. Freedman and his wife, Bathsheba, a clinical psychologist, moved to Cambridge, where he later became president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which is based there.

 In addition to his wife and son, Jared, of Washington, he is survived by a daughter, Deborah Freedman, of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.

 Mr. Freedman was by nature a private man, but he often opened his life publicly to help others. In talks with students, he told of his transformation from a shy and reserved boy who had lacked confidence into a public figure. He also spoke openly of his long fight with cancer.

 ''Hearing a physician say the dread word 'cancer' has an uncanny capacity to concentrate the mind,'' he said at Dartmouth's 1994 graduation ceremony, a time when chemotherapy had caused him to lose much of his hair.

 ''That is what liberal education does, too,'' he said. ''When the ground seems to shake and shift beneath us, liberal education provides perspective, enabling us to see life steadily and see it whole. It has taken an illness to remind me, in my middle age, of that lesson.''","The New York Times                              March 22, 2006 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  James Freedman, Former Dartmouth President, Dies at 70"

 A spokeswoman for Luxembourg's government news agency confirmed the death. No place or cause of death was immediately released.

 A longtime politician and businessman, Mr. Thorn led the government in the tiny Duchy of Luxembourg from 1974 to 1979. He was known as a strong advocate of European integration.

 Gaston Egmond Thorn was born in the capital, Luxembourg city, on Sept. 3, 1928. He took part in the resistance against Nazi occupation during World War II and spent several months in prison for his opposition to Hitler's invasion of his country. The war shaped his views promoting European unity as a way to prevent future conflict on the Continent.

 After the war, he studied law in France before entering politics in Luxembourg. He rose through the Liberal Democrat Party ranks and was appointed deputy mayor of Luxembourg city before entering the national Parliament.

 He was chairman of the Commission of the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union, from 1981 to 1985, after which he returned to business.

 Mr. Thorn was president of the United NationsGeneral Assembly from 1975 to 1976.

"Former Gov. Robert E. McNair of South Carolina, the political moderate who was a finalist to become Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey's running mate in 1968 but whose promising career was cut short by what became known as the Orangeburg Massacre, died last Saturday in Charleston.",38788,2007-11-24 00:00:00,"Former Gov. Robert E. McNair of South Carolina, the political moderate who was a finalist to become Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey's running mate in 1968 but whose promising career was cut short by what became known as the Orangeburg Massacre, died last Saturday in Charleston. He was 83.

 The cause was brain cancer, O. Wayne Corley, senior shareholder in the McNair Law Firm, announced.

 Mr. McNair was remembered as a progressive governor at a time of racial change and social and political upheaval, but the deaths on Feb. 8, 1968, of three black college students from state highway patrol gunfire, and the wounding of 27 others, put an end to his hope of higher office.

 Mr. McNair, born Dec. 14, 1923, in the rural Low Country of South Carolina, was buried Tuesday near his childhood home in Berkeley County. As lieutenant governor in 1965, he succeeded Gov. Donald S. Russell, who resigned to take the Senate seat vacated by the death of Olin D. Johnston. Mr. McNair was elected to a full four-year term in 1966.

 Mr. McNair received contemporary attention for his deft handling of several tense racial conflicts, including a student protest at the historically black South Carolina State College, now university, in Orangeburg, in the spring of 1967. But then came the shootings the next February.

 The shootings occurred on the third night of growing tension that began with student protests against the refusal of Orangeburg's only bowling alley to accept black patrons. Nine highway patrolmen, who had been issued deadly buckshot in a crowd-control situation and given individual authority to fire weapons if they believed their life or that of a fellow officer was in danger, were later acquitted of federal charges of imposing summary punishment without due process of law.

 Mr. McNair had blamed ''black power'' influences for the events; he also incorrectly stated the morning after the shooting that it had occurred ''off the campus.''

 In 1967 Mr. McNair had played host to Humphrey on a visit to the state that included an address to the Legislature and a luncheon meeting that Mr. McNair set up in Greenville. There Humphrey heard local and state business and industry leaders, as well as the state president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and chief executive of the state N.A.A.C.P., which remained the state's dominant civil rights organization, speak with pride of South Carolina's linked progress in economic development and accommodation to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act.

 At the raucous Democratic National Convention in Chicago in the summer of 1968, Mr. McNair arrived as chairman of both the Southern Governors Conference and the National Democratic Governors Conference. His South Carolina delegation included 12 African-Americans, including the state N.A.A.C.P. president, Alonzo W. Holman.

 In vetting Mr. McNair, who was notified he was one of four finalists for Humphrey's running mate, a top aide to Humphrey asked Mr. Holman if he could support Mr. McNair. Mr. Holman responded that if not for what had happened at Orangeburg, he could have supported Mr. McNair enthusiastically, but that he no longer could. Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine became the party's vice-presidential nominee.

 With no Southerner on the Democratic ticket for the first time in decades, Humphrey and Muskie carried only President Lyndon B. Johnson's Texas among the 11 states that had formed the Confederacy.

 Mr. McNair, who built a highly successful law firm, never again sought public office.

 He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Josephine Robinson McNair of Columbia; a son, Robert E. Jr., of Columbia; three daughters, Robin Lee Howell and Corinne Godshall of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Claudia Crawford McNair of Jamestown, S.C.; , six grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.

 In a biography published in 2006, Mr. McNair acknowledged ''responsibility'' for what happened in Orangeburg.

 The state of South Carolina has never conducted an official investigation of the shootings. A bill introduced in the state House of Representatives this year providing for such a study never emerged from a subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, but remains available for consideration in 2008.","The New York Times                             November 24, 2007 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Robert McNair, 83, Governor Of South Carolina in the '60s"

 The cause was heart failure, his son Robert said.

 Mr. Mercer started his career as an auditor and eventually climbed up the ranks to become president and chairman of the telephone company, New England's largest, which served 3.7 million customers at the time he retired.

 William Crawford Mercer was born on Jan. 13, 1919, in Philadelphia and grew up in New Jersey. He graduated from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in 1940. He served in the Army Air Force for five years, rising to the rank of captain.

 In 1947, he joined the Bell System as an auditor. The company paid for Mr. Mercer to further his education as a Sloan fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he graduated with a master's degree in management in 1956.

 He held several positions in the company before becoming president in 1971.

 He served as a trustee of the Boston Museum of Science and of Colby-Sawyer College in New London, N.H., the alma mater of his wife, Ramona, who died in 2005, and was a director of the United Way of Massachusetts.

 Mr. Mercer, a strong advocate for women in the business world, was the first to appoint a woman to his company's board. He was later appointed by Presidents Nixon and Ford to serve on commissions studying women's issues.

 Mr. Mercer retired in 1982 after a federal antitrust ruling broke up AT&T, the parent company of New England Telephone.

He was 75.

 The cause was multiple myeloma, his son Matt said.

 Mr. Timothy was president of the NBC Television Network and NBC's entertainment division in the early 1980s, then was promoted to group executive vice president of NBC, with expanded responsibilities for business matters. After a period of low ratings and consequent dissatisfaction on the part of NBC affiliates in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was part of a team led by Grant Tinker, then the chairman, that revived the network.

 Programs introduced by Brandon Tartikoff, head of the network's entertainment division, had raised ratings by the mid-1980s. Until then, Mr. Timothy used patience and his experience at managing NBC stations and working with affiliates to stem defections by the company's affiliates, said a former NBC spokesman, Bud Rukeyser.

 Raymond Joseph Timothy was born in Manhattan on March 23, 1932, and grew up in Little Neck, Queens. He graduated from Queens College with a major in political science. After serving in the Army in the military police at Fort Lewis, Wash., he earned a law degree from Brooklyn College.

 He sought a job as a tour guide on NBC's guest-relations staff in 1954, because he wanted to learn about the new business of television. He was given a job that paid $162 a month, including uniforms. He was promoted regularly, from scenery mover to accounting to sales. He managed NBC-owned stations in Washington, Cleveland and Los Angeles.

 In 1975, he became general manager of WNBC-TV in New York and in the late 1970s asked to be moved over to affiliate relations at the network. At the time, many NBC stations were being wooed away by ABC.

 In 1982, he became president of the NBC Television Network.

 In 1984, Mr. Timothy's role expanded to include business affairs and NBC Productions. In 1986, he was promoted to group executive president of NBC and retired from that position in 1988. He then worked for Furman Selz, a financial advisory firm. In 1997, he started Salem Partners, a media and entertainment-industry company that helped Wall Street firms raise capital.

 The cause was leukemia, Mr. Garrison's partner of 17 years, Mark Harris, said.

 Mr. Garrison had been deputy Republican counsel for the investigation when he was hastily chosen, on July 21, 1974, to replace Albert E. Jenner Jr. as chief counsel. Mr. Jenner was removed by the Republican committee members after he advocated the impeachment of Nixon and helped write a 306-page summary of supporting evidence.

 With only a few days to prepare, Mr. Garrison wrote that Nixon should not be impeached unless it was likely he would be convicted by the Senate and removed from office.

 The issue, he said, was not ''a narrow question'' of whether the president ''did, on a certain date, perform an act'' with which Congress members ''disagree, or even whether it could be considered, on some theory of law, as complicity in a crime.'' Rather, he said, the central question was ''whether the public interest would be served or disserved by removal from office.''

 Mr. Garrison also argued that in citing executive privilege as the basis for refusing to comply with subpoenas for tape-recorded conversations, the president was exercising his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

 On Aug. 8, 1974, after the House committee passed three articles of impeachment charging obstruction of justice, Nixon resigned.

 Samuel Alexander Garrison III was born in Roanoke on Feb. 21, 1942, the son of Doris Hatcher and Samuel Garrison Jr. In addition to Mr. Harris, Mr. Garrison is survived by his son, David, of Exton, Pa., and three grandchildren. His marriage ended in divorce.

 Mr. Garrison graduated from the University of Virginia in 1963 and received his law degree there in 1966. After three years as an assistant Virginia commonwealth attorney (or prosecutor), Mr. Garrison was elected as commonwealth attorney for Roanoke. In 1971, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew chose him as his liaison to Congress.

 After Nixon's resignation, Mr. Garrison returned to Roanoke to practice law. In 1980, he was sentenced to a year in prison for embezzling $46,000 from the bankruptcy account of a mobile home company, which he was representing. He was released after four months. Although he was disbarred after his conviction, Mr. Garrison's law license was reinstated in 1993.

 By the early 1980s, Mr. Garrison had announced that he was gay and soon became active in the gay rights movement.","The New York Times                                June 5, 2007 Tuesday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Samuel A.

"Geoffrey Polites, the chief executive of Jaguar and Land Rover who played a key role in arranging last month's deal to sell the brands to an Indian automaker, died Sunday in his hometown, Melbourne, Australia.",35814,2008-04-22 00:00:00,"Geoffrey Polites, the chief executive of Jaguar and Land Rover who played a key role in arranging last month's deal to sell the brands to an Indian automaker, died Sunday in his hometown, Melbourne, Australia. He was 60.

 The Ford Motor Company, based in Dearborn, Mich., confirmed his death, saying it followed a serious illness of more than two years; Mr. Polites had been quoted in industry publications as saying he had cancer.

 Mr. Polites, who lived in Great Britain while running Jaguar and Land Rover since 2005, had traveled to Melbourne last week after the birth of his first grandchild, the Sydney Morning Herald reported; his health worsened unexpectedly before he could see the child and he was admitted to a hospital, where he died.

 Mr. Polites had been with Ford for nearly 40 years, as a product planner, dealer and executive. His tenure with the carmaker was expected to end this quarter, when Tata Motors of India plans to take control of Jaguar and Land Rover. Ford will receive $1.7 billion from Tata, about one-third of the total price it originally paid for Jaguar and Land Rover in 1989 and 2000, respectively.

 Ford said that David Smith, the chief financial officer of Jaguar Land Rover, would act as the brands' chief executive until a successor to Mr. Polites was selected.

 Ford Australia hired Mr. Polites as a product planner in 1970. He held several executive positions with Ford in Australia and Europe before leaving in 1988 to run the City Ford dealership in Sydney.

 In 1999, Mr. Polites became president of Ford Australia, where he often fraternized with factory workers and eliminated executive perks.

 Jaguar and Land Rover were money losers when Mr. Polites was appointed to head them in 2005. They made a profit in all four quarters of 2007, Ford said.

 ''His drive and determination, combined with his clear sense of vision for the business, played a huge role in turning round the business at Jaguar Land Rover and returning it to profitability,'' Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said in a statement. ''Geoff ensured that Jaguar Land Rover was not distracted and continued to focus on the fundamentals of the business during the recent sale process, despite at the time also fighting his own personal health battle.''

 Mr. Polites, who was born in Melbourne in 1948, received an economics degree from Monash University there.

 He is survived by his wife, Linda, and two sons.","The New York Times                               April 22, 2008 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Geoffrey Polites, 60, Australian Ford Official"
"Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the last leader of the Polish Communist Party and the last Communist prime minister of Poland, who deftly -- inscrutably, some said -- juggled his reputation as a reformist with what became open antipathy toward the Solidarity movement, died Friday in Warsaw.",12231,2008-11-12 00:00:00,"Mieczyslaw Rakowski, the last leader of the Polish Communist Party and the last Communist prime minister of Poland, who deftly -- inscrutably, some said -- juggled his reputation as a reformist with what became open antipathy toward the Solidarity movement, died Friday in Warsaw. He was 81.

 Polish Radio said the cause was cancer.

 Mr. Rakowski (his full name is pronounced MY-cheh-slav Rah-KOF-skee) was for decades the editor of an influential weekly newspaper and was known for his carefully calibrated criticism of the Communist government.

 Early on, he urged the government to recognize Solidarity, which started as a labor union and grew into a democratic political force and ultimately Poland's government.

 After becoming deputy prime minister in January 1981, Mr. Rakowski pushed for liberalizing reforms, telling a party congress in July that the alternative, in the face of mounting dissent, was a bloodbath.

 The next month, he tried to strike a deal with Solidarity to give labor unions a formal role in Polish society, but the talks collapsed in acrimony.

 On news broadcasts, Poles saw an angry Mr. Rakowski shaking his finger in the face of Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader.

 Less than a year later, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the de facto head of government, imposed martial law to crush Solidarity. Thousands were arrested without charge and more than 100 were killed.

 Mr. Rakowski defended the ''state of war,'' which lasted until July 1983, as necessary to forestall the Soviets from invading to re-establish order.

 Mr. Rakowski became prime minister in September 1988 and held the post until August 1989. In July 1989 he was appointed first secretary of the Polish Communist Party, succeeding General Jaruzelski, who stayed on as president.

 In his leadership posts, Mr. Rakowski presided over ''round-table'' negotiations that led to the legalization of Solidarity, the dissolution of the Communist Party and Poland's becoming a pluralist democracy.

 For many years, Mr. Rakowski, with his superb connections, his facility in languages (German, Russian and English) and a flair for sartorial style then unusual in Eastern Europe, was a magnet for visiting foreigners, particularly politicians and journalists, who liked his candor. He steadfastly defended Communist governance as necessary to avoid a Russian invasion.

 Mr. Walesa -- whom Mr. Rakowski used to call ''Doctor,'' a sarcastic reference to his lack of formal education -- said in an interview with The Washington Post last year that he had understood Mr. Rakowski's view. Polish Communists, he said, thought that the Russians ''had directed missiles at every Polish city.''

 ''I do not punish people for faith, and they believed in that,'' Mr. Walesa added. ''I'm leaving the judgments to God.''

 Mieczyslaw Franciszek Rakowski was born on Dec. 1, 1926, in the western Polish village of Kowalewko. His father, a farmer, was shot by a Nazi firing squad.

 The younger Mr. Rakowski worked in a railway repair shop and then earned a doctorate in history. He joined the Communist Party in 1946 and was assigned in 1949 to the Central Committee to write party documents and propaganda.

 In 1956, Wladyslaw Gomulka became party leader and pushed for a relaxation of some of the more repressive policies of Stalin. In this new atmosphere of de-Stalinization, Mr. Rakowski helped found Polityka, a weekly. He was editor in chief from 1958 to 1982 and developed a talent for criticizing officials in metaphors.

 In the mid-1960s, as repression returned, Mr. Rakowski refused to follow others in attacking the Roman Catholic Church and Jews. He ignored orders to fire Jews.

 ''If I am prepared to give up one tooth, I'll have to give up all of them,'' he said of his refusal to compromise on such issues, The Wall Street Journal reported in 1982.

 Mr. Rakowski's first marriage was to Wanda Wilkomirska, a gifted Polish violinist. She was Jewish, was active in dissident groups and helped shape his liberalism by introducing him to artists and intellectuals who resisted Communism. They divorced in 1977. His second wife was Elzbieta Kepinska, an actress who was barred from performing by the theatrical establishment in protest of her husband's association with martial law. After the first multiparty elections in 1989, she was able to resume her career.

 Mr. Rakowski is survived by Ms. Kepinska and two sons.

 In 1987, Mr. Rakowski was appointed the Central Committee's secretary for propaganda, one of several party jobs he held between being deputy prime minister and prime minister.

 As chief propagandist, he controlled the same press censorship he had fought for a quarter-century.

 After the Polish Communist Party dissolved itself in January 1990, The Washington Post sent a reporter to the office of the party's last leader. Mr. Rakowski sat facing an empty wall. He had taken down the portrait of Lenin that had hung there for years.

 ''The Communist Party should be relegated to history,'' he said.","The New York Times                            November 12, 2008 Wednesday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Mieczyslaw Rakowski, 81, Poland's Last Communist Premier, Dies"

Tolbert, the state director in Nevada for Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign and an aide to New York City schools chancellor Joel I. Klein, died on Sunday in North Las Vegas. He was 44.

 The cause was a heart attack, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement. A friend, Basil A. Smikle Jr., said Mr. Tolbert was stricken while driving alone on Sunday night near the Obama campaign offices in North Las Vegas.

 Since 2006, Mr. Tolbert had been the City Education Department's chief lobbyist in Albany and Washington. He had been poised to take a leading role in Mr. Bloomberg's coming fight to persuade New York lawmakers to reauthorize the law giving the mayor control of the city's public schools. The law expires at the end of June.

 Mr. Tolbert had been on leave since August working for the Obama campaign. In 2003-4, he was the New York state director for John Edwards's presidential campaign, and in 2004, he was the Nevada state director of America Coming Together, a Democratic advocacy group.

 He also worked on Mr. Bloomberg's re-election effort in 2005, serving as a liaison to the city's patchwork of ethnic, religious and cultural groups, and for eight years was chief of staff to Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, a Harlem Democrat.

"Evan G. Galbraith Jr., a former ambassador to France and a Republican contender for governor of New York in 1994, died Monday at his home in Manhattan.",35543,2008-01-25 00:00:00,"Evan G. Galbraith Jr., a former ambassador to France and a Republican contender for governor of New York in 1994, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.

 The cause was cancer, said his wife, the former Marie Rockwell.

 For 15 years before accepting the ambassadorship in 1981, Mr. Galbraith, who was also an international banker, had been chairman of National Review, the conservative magazine founded by William F. Buckley Jr. He and Mr. Buckley were friends from their days together at Yale in the late 1940s. ''Extremely close friends,'' Mr. Buckley said in a telephone interview on Thursday, observing that he and Mr. Galbraith had sailed together across the Atlantic three times and across the Pacific once.

 ''He was anti-Communist, an internationalist, a free trader, a capitalist and the most sustained enthusiast I've ever met for the causes and people he embraced,'' Mr. Buckley said.

 As President Ronald Reagan's ambassador to France from 1981 to 1985, Mr. Galbraith frequently irritated the government of President Francois Mitterrand with his positions, suggesting in 1984, for example, that Mr. Mitterrand's Socialist Party was quite likely to lose its parliamentary majority in coming elections. He also said the Communist Party was ''sort of outside the law'' and should no longer be allowed to take part in the French government. The government called his statements ''unacceptable.''

 A year later, Mr. Galbraith said that the majority of career Foreign Service officers were ''liberals'' who were not carrying out Mr. Reagan's policies with enthusiasm: the best argument, he said, for placing political appointees like himself in important ambassadorial posts. The secretary of state at the time, George P. Shultz, issued a statement disagreeing with Mr. Galbraith.

 In 1994, Mr. Galbraith made a bid for governor of New York; he had also tried to run in 1990 but he had not lived in the state long enough. Seeking the Republican nomination along with five others trying to unseat Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, he called for cutting corporate taxes by about half, eliminating most welfare and cutting the state payroll by 25 percent. George E. Pataki won the nomination and the governorship.

 Evan Griffith Galbraith Jr., who was known as Van, was born in Toledo, Ohio, on July 2, 1928, a son of Evan and Nina Allen Galbraith. His father was a doctor and his mother was a nurse. Mr. Galbraith graduated from Yale in 1950 with a bachelor's degree in history and economics. In 1953, he graduated from the Harvard Law School. From 1953 to 1957, he served in the Navy.

 After working at a New York law firm, Mr. Galbraith joined the Eisenhower administration as an assistant to the secretary of commerce. He later held management positions in banking, including the chairmanship of Bankers Trust International in London. He was also chairman of a United States holding company for LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French conglomerate.

 Besides his wife, Mr. Galbraith is survived by a daughter, Christina Galbraith of Manhattan; two sons, John, of Manhattan, and Evan 3rd, of Tuxedo Park, N.Y.; a brother, John, of Toledo; and two grandchildren.","The New York Times                              January 25, 2008 Friday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Evan Galbraith, Ambassador, Dies at 79"
"Patrick J. Hillery, a physician-turned-politician who served 14 years as Ireland's president after a long ministerial career that won him admiration for his handling of the volatile issue of British rule in Northern Ireland, died Saturday in Dublin.",35793,2008-04-16 00:00:00,"Patrick J. Hillery, a physician-turned-politician who served 14 years as Ireland's president after a long ministerial career that won him admiration for his handling of the volatile issue of British rule in Northern Ireland, died Saturday in Dublin. He was 84.

 A government announcement said his death followed a short illness, but gave no other details.

 Mr. Hillery also had a role in negotiating Ireland's entry into the European Economic Community in 1973. His two terms as president, from 1976 to 1990, ended before the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which set terms for an end to violence in Northern Ireland. But he acted at crucial moments as an emollient influence on the republic's policies toward the north, and set a tone that helped pave the way for eventual peace

 His approach, especially as Ireland's foreign minister, combined moments of confrontation with Britain over its policies toward the Roman Catholic minority in Northern Ireland with a similarly steadfast attitude toward hard-line nationalists within his own Fianna Fail party, which has dominated Irish politics for long periods since the 1922 agreement that created separate governments in Dublin and Belfast.

 He became foreign minister in 1969, just as a new era of sectarian violence began in Northern Ireland.

 He stirred antagonism in London with his protests against the failure of the Protestant-dominated police in Northern Ireland to protect Catholic areas and rights protesters. Snubbed in London, he took his case to the United Nations, proposing unsuccessfully that the task of keeping peace be handed to a joint British and Irish military force or to a United Nations peacekeeping force.

 After the first British Army house searches in the north provoked further Catholic protests, he brushed aside diplomatic protocol to make an unannounced visit to the Catholic stronghold in the Falls Road area of Belfast, further infuriating the British.

 After 13 civilians were killed by British troops in the ''Bloody Sunday'' shooting in Londonderry in 1972, Mr. Hillery took his case to Washington.

 ''I believe the British government have gone mad,'' he told an American television interviewer at the time. He predicted that Britain's ''lunatic course'' in sending troops to the north could lead to war between Britain and Ireland.

 But those and other incidents masked a determination to steer a course toward peace. Years after he made his Falls Road visit, he said he had made the trip to pre-empt hard-liners in the Dublin cabinet who were planning to go to Belfast and encourage the armed resistance against British rule that was led by the Irish Republican Army. He also opposed demands among Fianna Fail hard-liners for an early withdrawal of British troops.

 ''Northern Ireland is an armed state,'' he said. ''There are over 100,000 guns in private hands, and this problem must be solved before withdrawal.''

 Patrick John Hillery was born on May 2, 1923, on the west coast of County Clare; his father was a doctor. After earning a medical degree at University College Dublin, he lived briefly in Canada before winning an election in 1951 to the Dail, the Irish Parliament, as a running mate of Eamon de Valera, who led the Irish struggle for independence. He was education minister from 1959 to 1966, promoting comprehensive schools outside the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church that have been credited with helping Ireland produce the educated work force that contributed to the economic boom of the last 20 years.

 After Ireland joined Europe, he was appointed as Ireland's representative on the European Commission; as the official in charge of social policy, he promoted the rights of migrant workers and defended equal pay for women.

 Reluctantly, he ran unopposed for the Irish presidency after the incumbent, Cearbhall O Dalaigh, resigned over a bitter dispute with the defense minister. Mr. Hillery adopted an insistently nonpartisan stance, retreating from public view and spending much of his time playing golf.

 He is survived by his wife, Mary Beatrice, known as Maeve, and a son, John, who is also a doctor. A daughter, Vivienne, died before him.

 He made no secret that he found the job of a figurehead frustrating.

 ''Children used to ask me if it was nice to be president, and you would have to say 'yes,' '' he said after leaving office. ''You know, you couldn't disappoint them.''","The New York Times                              April 16, 2008 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  Patrick J.

"Retired Gen. Valentin I. Varennikov, who plotted to overthrow President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and called the collapse of the Soviet Union ''the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century,'' died Wednesday in Moscow.",41640,2009-05-08 00:00:00,"MOSCOW -- Retired Gen. Valentin I. Varennikov, who plotted to overthrow President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and called the collapse of the Soviet Union ''the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century,'' died Wednesday in Moscow. He was 85.

 His death was announced by the Club of Military Commanders, an association of retired officers, where he was staying while recovering from surgery.

 Twelve men were initially charged with high treason in the August 1991 plot against Mr. Gorbachev, which fizzled within three days. When the plotters were offered a political amnesty, only General Varennikov refused to accept it and insisted on standing trial, using the occasion to publicly inveigh against liberalization.

 ''I have no regrets about what I did,'' he told the courtroom. ''But I have a bitter feeling that we failed to save the country.''

 He was acquitted. In its decision, the Military Collegium of the Russian Supreme Court declared that General Varennikov ''was interested only in preserving and strengthening his country.''

 He parlayed the verdict into a successful political career in Russia's lower house of Parliament, and became a fervent admirer of Vladimir V. Putin, the prime minister and former president who he said ''leads the country along the road of rebirth and restoration of its former majesty.''

 General Varennikov fought for the Soviet Union during World War II, and served in wars in Angola, Syria, Ethiopia and Afghanistan. In 1988, he was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal, the U.S.S.R.'s highest honor.

 Six years into Mr. Gorbachev's perestroika, as deputy defense minister, General Varennikov offered assistance to the group of hard-liners who styled themselves the State Committee for the State of Emergency. In mid-August 1991, while Mr. Gorbachev was vacationing in Crimea, the committee announced that the president had stepped down for health reasons. Troops surrounded Mr. Gorbachev's vacation house and it was left to Boris N. Yeltsin, then president of the Russian Federation, to rally huge crowds of Muscovites against the coup.

 Three days later, the Emergency Committee left the city in a column of tanks and armor, and the conspirators gradually faded from view. All, that is, except General Varennikov, who stubbornly refused the amnesty offered by a sympathetic Parliament.

 His acquittal, he told reporters after the trial, was ''proof of Mikhail Gorbachev's guilt.'' Over the next years, as Russia lurched along the road to liberalization and market reform, he remained a committed -- and vocal -- Stalinist.

 ''Under Stalin, we were not buying wheat from the West, we were selling it on international markets,'' he told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ''We didn't go around the world asking for humanitarian aid and loans, we were granting them. That is the paradox.''

 By the time of his death, General Varennikov's views had gravitated back toward the mainstream of Russian society, and the news was met, for the most part, with respectful tributes. Even those who disagreed said they admired his backbone.

 ''I considered him my enemy for his views, never understood his deeds, but respected him because he held on to his beliefs, such as they were,'' wrote Aleksandr Arkangelsky, a journalist at the newspaper Izvestiya, on his blog. ''He took responsibility for those beliefs like a man. May he rest in peace and may God forgive him.''

"Donald C. Alexander, a former Internal Revenue Service commissioner who said that President Richard M. Nixon tried several times to fire him because he would not use the tax agency for political purposes, died last Monday at his home in Washington.",4329,2009-02-09 00:00:00,"Donald C. Alexander, a former Internal Revenue Service commissioner who said that President Richard M. Nixon tried several times to fire him because he would not use the tax agency for political purposes, died last Monday at his home in Washington. He was 87.

 His death, of cancer, was announced by the law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, where he practiced until two weeks before he died.

 Mr. Alexander was commissioner from May 1973, in the last full year of the Nixon administration, through the first weeks of the Carter administration in February 1977.

 Critics of Nixon had accused him of using the I.R.S. to go after his own critics, including opponents of the Vietnam War. John W. Dean III, the White House counsel, wrote a memorandum in 1971 describing how the Nixon administration could ''use the available federal machinery'' to make trouble for ''our political enemies.''

 On Aug. 9, 1973, about 10 weeks into his job as commissioner, Mr. Alexander announced that he had shut down the Special Service Staff of the I.R.S., which had been investigating critics of Nixon and his Vietnam policies. That night Nixon made the first of several attempts to fire him, Mr. Alexander wrote in Tax Notes magazine in 1999, leaving it unclear why Nixon ultimately allowed him to continue in the job.

 Mr. Alexander closed the unit, he said in the article, because ''political or social views, 'extremist' or otherwise, are irrelevant to taxation.''

 Mr. Alexander told fellow tax lawyers and journalists that he was appalled at some of the investigative techniques he had learned about, notably those used in a 1971 investigation of offshore tax evasion.

 In one instance, he said, I.R.S. agents had arranged for a banker to go on a date with a woman who had given the agents a key to her Miami apartment. The agents, who did not have a search warrant, copied 400 documents they found in the banker's briefcase, Mr. Alexander said. A judge later found the search illegal, causing the case to collapse.

 Within the I.R.S., Mr. Alexander became known as a stickler for proper procedure, which caused friction with the criminal investigation division. In Oval Office tapes, Nixon referred to him once, using a crude term, as someone who was prissy about legal procedure.

 In 1973, Senator Joseph M. Montoya, Democrat of New Mexico, had started hearings on the I.R.S. only to become the subject of an audit. Mr. Alexander stopped the audit. Two years later, The Washington Post ran a front-page article based on complaints by I.R.S. agents who believed that Mr. Alexander's action had been improper. A Treasury Department investigation later concluded that Mr. Alexander had done nothing wrong.

 Sheldon S. Cohen, an I.R.S. commissioner in the Johnson administration, said Mr. Alexander had been ''a straight arrow.''

 ''And while I did not always agree with Don, he always took positions in a tax controversy on a principled basis,'' Mr. Cohen said.

 Donald Crichton Alexander was born in Pine Bluff, Ark., in 1921, the son of William C. Alexander and the former Ella Temple Fox. Their marriage ended in divorce when he was 3.

 Mr. Alexander was an Army forward artillery observer in World War II and received a Bronze Star and a Silver Star. He graduated from Yale in 1942 and from Harvard Law School in 1948. He then entered private practice as a tax lawyer, working at Covington & Burling, among other firms.

 He is survived by a son, James, of New Haven, and one grandchild. His wife, Margaret, and another son, Robert, died earlier.

 Mr. Alexander's views on proper conduct were shaped in part by an incident shortly after World War II, when he was a young lawyer in Washington. In two tape-recorded interviews with the journalist David Burnham, Mr. Alexander told of a luncheon meeting involving his boss at the Metropolitan Club in Washington in which a lobbyist was given $25,000 to bribe a Treasury official to get a favorable tax ruling for a client.

 Mr. Alexander was so upset by the event that he nearly quit the law ''because this was crooked and I wanted no part of it,'' he told Mr. Burnham in Mr. Burnham's 1989 book about the I.R.S., ''A Law Unto Itself.''

 Numerous Congressional investigations later found widespread corruption in what was then the Internal Revenue Bureau, though none of those at the lunch were charged with any crime.

Minarik III, an energetic political operative who was the New York State Republican chairman from 2004 to 2006, a time of declining fortunes for the party, died on Sunday in Rochester. He was 49 and lived in Webster, N.Y.

 Assemblyman William D. Reilich, the Monroe County Republican chairman, said Mr. Minarik had a heart attack. He had had a stroke in 2001.

 In his two-year tenure, Mr. Minarik struggled to find candidates to compete against Eliot Spitzer for governor, Hillary Rodham Clinton for senator and other strong Democrats in 2006. He failed to unify his party behind the former Massachusetts governor, William F. Weld, for the governorship; the nomination went to John J. Faso, a former Assembly minority leader, who was crushed by Mr. Spitzer.

 Mr. Minarik championed Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, for the Senate, but she withdrew after failing to attract money or attention, and later fell short in a bid for state attorney general, a post won by Andrew M. Cuomo. In the Senate race, Mr. Minarik finally endorsed former Mayor John Spencer of Yonkers, who was trounced by Mrs. Clinton.

 After the 2006 elections, which produced a Democratic sweep of statewide offices and the worst defeat for New York Republicans since the Great Depression, Mr. Minarik resigned as state chairman and was succeeded by Joseph N. Mondello, Nassau County's Republican chairman. But Mr. Minarik remained chairman of the Monroe County Republicans until 2008, when he resigned after 16 years in the post.

 Stephen J. Minarik III was born in Rochester on Jan. 2, 1960, the son of Stephen J. Jr. and Eleanor Minarik. He graduated from Irondequoit High School in 1978 and the University of Rochester in 1982. A year later, he became a clerk for the Monroe County Legislature's Republican majority. He worked in campaigns that elected Representative Fred J. Eckert and Monroe County Executive Lucien A. Morin.

 In 1990, he became executive director of the Republican county organization and two years later was elected its chairman. He led a Republican takeover of the county Legislature, helped elect three consecutive county executives, and candidates for sheriff and town supervisors, a record that led to his selection as state chairman.

 Mr. Minarik is survived by his wife, Renee Forgensi Minarik, a State Court of Claims judge in Rochester and Buffalo; a son, Stephen IV; a daughter, Stephanie; two stepchildren, Christopher and Kathleen; and a brother, Daniel, of Rochester.

 Growing up in Rochester, Mr. Minarik developed a passion for conservative politics early. He promoted friends for the student council in high school and for student government at the University of Rochester, where he majored in political science. Later, he used his talents to elect candidates to county and state offices.

 But he never yearned to be a candidate. ''I love getting people elected,'' he said when Gov. George E. Pataki named him state chairman after the party's poor showing in the 2004 elections. ''I never wanted to be elected myself. There is a huge difference between being a candidate and being an operative. A candidate is out front every day. He or she has to shake hands and smile. I don't have the personality for that.''","The New York Times                              April 15, 2009 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  Stephen Minarik, 49; Led New York G.O.P."
"Jody Powell, a sandy-haired former Georgia farm boy who was President Jimmy Carter's closest and most trusted aide, working with him from his days as Georgia governor through the Carter presidency, died Monday at his home near Cambridge, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.",34917,2009-09-15 00:00:00,"Jody Powell, a sandy-haired former Georgia farm boy who was President Jimmy Carter's closest and most trusted aide, working with him from his days as Georgia governor through the Carter presidency, died Monday at his home near Cambridge, on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. He was 65.

 Mr. Powell collapsed outside his home, and efforts to revive him at a hospital were futile, said Jack Nelson, who hurled questions at Mr. Powell three decades ago as Washington bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times and became his good friend afterward. Mr. Nelson said Mr. Powell's wife, Nan, had told him her husband apparently suffered a heart attack.

 After leaving the White House in 1981, Mr. Powell was a syndicated columnist, author and public relations executive. In recent years, he was chairman of Powell Tate, an influential Washington-based public relations firm in which he was a partner, somewhat improbably, with Sheila Tate, a former press aide for Nancy Reagan.

 Mr. Powell's official White House title was press secretary to Mr. Carter, but he was much more than that. Unlike many White House spokesmen, Mr. Powell really did have his boss's ear and really was privy to his boss's thinking.

 ''Jody was beside me in every decision I made as a candidate, governor and president, and I could always depend on his advice and counsel being candid and direct,'' Mr. Carter said in a statement on Monday. ''I will miss him dearly.''

 Mr. Powell's path to the White House really began in 1966, when he was walking through a south Georgia shopping center and a smiling man thrust a hand toward him and said, ''Hi! I'm Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for governor.''

 Then not long out of college, Mr. Powell took an immediate liking to the aspiring governor. They had roots in the same region in Georgia: Mr. Carter was from Plains, and Mr. Powell grew up in Vienna, about 25 miles away. Mr. Carter was a peanut farmer. So was Mr. Powell's father, who also raised cotton. And both men were churchgoing Baptists.

 Mr. Carter lost in 1966, and when he ran for governor again in 1970, Mr. Powell volunteered to work in the campaign. He was Mr. Carter's chauffeur and formed an easy rapport with the candidate, who was impressed by Mr. Powell's knowledge of politics. Soon, Mr. Powell was functioning as press secretary, a position that became official when Mr. Carter moved into the Governor's Mansion.

 When Jimmy Carter unseated President Gerald R. Ford in the 1976 election, the appointment of Mr. Powell as press secretary was one of the new president's first announcements. As President Carter's spokesman, Mr. Powell was always fiercely loyal, sometimes quick-tempered and combative.

 But reporters liked and respected him for the most part, Mr. Nelson, the former Los Angeles Times reporter, said Monday. ''If he wasn't going to tell you something, he'd tell you,'' Mr. Nelson recalled. ''But if he told you something, you could take it to the bank.''

 Jim Wooten, a former White House correspondent for The New York Times who covered the Carter presidency, agreed. And those who were lulled into underestimating Mr. Powell because of his Southern drawl and ''good old boy'' ways did so at their peril, Mr. Wooten said. ''He was really quick, whip-smart,'' he said on Monday.

 Joseph Lester Powell Jr., who was nicknamed Jody after the young hero of the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings classic ''The Yearling,'' was born on Sept. 30, 1943, in Cordele, Ga. An A student and member of the debate team in high school, he also played quarterback on the football team. (Despite his athletic skills, he was a chain-smoker for many years.)

 When he was a senior cadet at the Air Force Academy in 1964, Mr. Powell was expelled for cheating on a history exam. He finished his studies at Georgia State University in Atlanta and was doing research on populist political movements when he began his association with Mr. Carter.

 Mr. Powell's survivors, in addition to his wife, include his mother, June Powell; a daughter, Emily Boddy, of Richmond, Va.; a sister, Susan Glenn, of Hilton Head, S.C., and three grandchildren.

 Mr. Powell was a Civil War buff and boasted that nine of his ancestors wore the rebel butternut and gray. His was the voice of Gen. Stonewall Jackson in Ken Burns's acclaimed public television series ''The Civil War.''

 But his principal role in life was as a defender of Jimmy Carter. He stayed in character when he wrote ''The Other Side of the Story'' (Morrow, 1984), in which he accused many journalists of looking down their noses at Mr. Carter and his fellow Georgians. (Mr. Powell described Rowland Evans and Robert D. Novak as ''two bombastic rascals whose only redeeming virtue is their lack of pretension to be anything else.'')

 Mr. Powell had honed his style years before, when Mr. Carter was governor. Responding to a critic who accused his boss of ''communistic'' tactics against opponents of the busing used to desegregate schools, Mr. Powell wrote that one of a governor's burdens was having to read ''barely legible letters from morons.''

 ''I respectfully suggest that you take two running jumps and go straight to hell,'' he continued.","The New York Times                             September 15, 2009 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Jody Powell, 65, Trusted Aide to Jimmy Carter, Dies"
"Myles Brand, a former college president who pushed for academic reforms in collegiate athletics as president of the N.C.A.A.",34922,2009-09-17 00:00:00,"Myles Brand, a former college president who pushed for academic reforms in collegiate athletics as president of the N.C.A.A. for the last six years, died Wednesday at his home in Indianapolis. He was 67 .

 His death was announced by the N.C.A.A. Mr. Brand announced in January that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. He continued to run the organization's day-to-day operations while undergoing treatment.

 When Mr. Brand became the head of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in January 2003, he seemed an unlikely choice. The departing president, Cedric Dempsey, had taken the post after serving as athletic director at the University of Arizona. But Mr. Brand was hardly recruited from the ranks of big-time athletics. He was a former philosophy professor, and while president of Indiana University he fired one of college sports' biggest names, the Hoosiers' men's basketball coach, Bob Knight, for abusive behavior. The decision led to a student protest at his home, quelled by police officers in riot gear.

 While at Indiana, Mr. Brand had likened the competition among collegiate powers in football and basketball to an arms race threatening academic integrity. When he was selected as N.C.A.A. president he said he would ''look forward to being a change agent.''

 At Mr. Brand's urging, the N.C.A.A. approved an academic reform package in 2004 penalizing colleges whose scholarship athletes did not meet standards for academic progress.

 ''It is a major change in the athletic culture,'' Mr. Brand said at the time. ''Nothing like this has been done before.''

 The new system, which remains in effect, goes beyond graduation rates, which had been used as a measure of academic progress. Each college team in Division I is awarded points when an athlete remains eligible and when the athlete advances academically from semester to semester. A college with programs that fall below a specified point level can lose athletic scholarships in those sports, and since 2008-9 can be kept from postseason play in the sport at issue.

 In May 2008, 37 football programs were penalized by the N.C.A.A. after submission of the annual Academic Progress Report, but only six programs were from the major conferences sending teams to the Bowl Championship Series. Mr. Brand viewed the actions taken by the N.C.A.A. as ''measurable progress.''

 Under Mr. Brand, the N.C.A.A. adopted recruiting reforms in 2004 eliminating lavish perks for prospective star athletes after scandals at the University of Colorado and at the University of Miami.

 Mr. Brand oversaw an N.C.A.A. crackdown against colleges with mascots, nicknames or images deemed ''hostile or abusive in terms of race, ethnicity or national origin.'' Implemented in 2005 and directed largely against the use of American Indian symbols, the N.C.A.A. directive banned the ethnic representations at postseason events it controlled, most notably the basketball tournament in March. Exceptions were made, however, for colleges receiving permission from the ethnic groups; as a result, Florida State University was allowed to continue as the Seminoles.

 In April 2008, the N.C.A.A. turned to abuses in youth basketball leagues, joining with the N.B.A. to finance their oversight beginning this summer.

 There were some contentious issues that Mr. Brand did not resolve.

 College football's Bowl Championship Series remains in place despite calls by many for a playoff series to determine the national champion. And there are still few African-American head coaches. ''It's more frustrating than anything I can think of,'' Mr. Brand said last December. ''I can't see my way clear to the solution.''

 Myles David Brand, a native of Brooklyn, was born May 17, 1942. He received a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Rochester. Among his academic posts, he was provost and a vice president at Ohio State University; chairman of the philosophy departments at the University of Illinois-Chicago and the University of Arizona, and president of the University of Oregon from 1989 to 1994, before being named president at Indiana.

 Mr. Brand is survived by his wife, the former Peg Zeglin, and a son, Joshua, from a previous marriage. The N.C.A.A. did not announce his successor.

 For all his advocacy of academic reform, Mr. Brand presided over a vast, multimillion-dollar sports culture. He paid tribute to college athletes for the fortitude they brought to their work.

 ''Here's an interesting fact,'' Mr. Brand told National Public Radio in 2005. ''Football players tend to do better academically during the fall when their teams are working hard than in the spring. They learn how to be focused and committed to what they're doing, and it shows. It's a great life experience.''","The New York Times                            September 17, 2009 Thursday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Myles Brand Dies at 67; Reformed College Athletics"
"Huang Hua, a Communist Party revolutionary who was China's foreign minister during the 1970s and early 1980s and helped China restore diplomatic relations with the United States, died Wednesday in Beijing.",19900,2010-11-25 00:00:00,"SHANGHAI -- Huang Hua, a Communist Party revolutionary who was China's foreign minister during the 1970s and early 1980s and helped China restore diplomatic relations with the United States, died Wednesday in Beijing. He was 97.

 The cause was complications of lung failure and kidney failure, his daughter-in-law, Dede Nickerson, said.

 A loyal deputy to Zhou Enlai, then the prime minister, Mr. Huang was an amiable statesman at a time when China was moving to end decades of international isolation. Backed by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, those efforts set the stage for the country's spectacular rise in the past three decades.

 As a senior diplomat with excellent English, Mr. Huang was known for his toothy smile and conservative brand of diplomacy. Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, called him ''one of the ablest public servants I have ever met'' and a ''trusted friend.''

 He met Mr. Kissinger during the secret trip Mr. Kissinger made to Beijing in 1971 as President Richard M. Nixon's national security adviser. He also negotiated with a series of American presidents, including Jimmy Carter, George Bush and Ronald Reagan, and he served as China's first ambassador to Canada.

 In late 1971, Mr. Huang was named China's first permanent representative to the United Nations, taking up the post shortly after Beijing gained a United Nations seat.

 As foreign minister, he held talks that led to the signing of a peace and friendship treaty with Japan, and he negotiated with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain regarding the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong to China.

 When Beijing ordered him to be tough, he was. After the United States and China resumed diplomatic relations in 1979, he accused the United States of backtracking on its promises when it continued to sell weapons to Taiwan, which China continues to regard as a renegade province.

 But Mr. Huang is perhaps best known for a secret trip he undertook as a college student in Beijing. In 1936, with China ravaged by civil war and Japanese aggression, he agreed to serve as an interpreter for the American journalist Edgar Snow, who had arranged to travel to a remote part of north China to meet a band of Communist rebels, including Mao.

 With Mr. Huang's help, Mr. Snow wrote a series of newspaper articles that created a sensation and led to the publication of ''Red Star Over China,'' a best seller and one of the first detailed accounts of Mao and the Chinese Communists.

 Mr. Snow was later accused of writing Communist propaganda. He denied any bias but eventually moved to Switzerland, where he died in 1972. Mr. Huang visited him shortly before his death.

 Huang Hua was born in January 1913 as Wang Rumei, the son of a teacher in Hebei Province, in northern China. After he joined the Communist Party, he changed his name to Huang Hua.

 In the 1930s, Mr. Huang was a student leader in Beijing at Yanjing University, which was run by American missionaries. Like many college students at the time, he demonstrated against Japanese military action in China. He even helped form the December 9th Movement, named for the date of an anti-Japanese protest in Beijing.

 After being detained by the police following a demonstration, he hid in the home of Mr. Snow and his wife, Helen Foster Snow, who was also a journalist. Mr. Snow was then teaching at Yanjing, and Mr. Huang was his student.

 In 1936, Mr. Snow arranged to travel to the Soviet region of north China, which was then under blockade by the Nationalist Chinese government. Mr. Huang, who had already secretly joined the Communist Party, agreed to serve as an interpreter.

 In Shaanxi Province, in northern China, Mr. Huang was one of several interpreters Mr. Snow depended on when he interviewed top Communist rebels. He translated Mr. Snow's notes into Chinese and then shared them with Mao to determine if they were accurate, Mr. Huang wrote in his memoir.

 After Mr. Snow returned to Beijing, Mr. Huang stayed in the region to aid the revolution. In the 1940s, he was a special assistant to Zhu De, a top Communist military strategist, and married He Liliang, who had moved to the area with her father, an adviser to Mao.

 Mr. Huang also served as an interpreter for the United States Army Observer Group, which traveled to Yan'an to meet with Mao and other rebel leaders after the American-backed Chinese Nationalists formed an alliance with the Communists to fight Japan.

 After the Communists took power in 1949, Mr. Huang joined the Foreign Ministry and negotiated the closing of the United States mission in China with John Leighton Stuart, the United States ambassador to China and a former dean of Yanjing University.

 Mr. Huang participated in talks to end the Korean War and the Geneva Conference in 1954. He served as China's ambassador to Ghana and Egypt between 1960 and 1969, when he returned during the Cultural Revolution because of the social and political upheaval Mao had created.

 On his return, he and his wife were forced to work on farms in two different regions of the country. But in 1970, when Mr. Snow was preparing to travel to Beijing to meet again with Mao, Mr. Huang was called back to Beijing to serve as an interpreter and accompany Mr. Snow around the country.

 It was during that trip that Mao hinted that he was willing to open talks with the United States and invited President Nixon to visit China.

 After Mr. Snow's visit, Mr. Huang was named ambassador to Canada and then permanent representative to the United Nations. He held secret talks with Mr. Kissinger in New York around the time of Mr. Nixon's China trip.

 In 1976, after Mao's death, the Chinese foreign minister, Qiao Guanhua, was dismissed because of accusations that he had close ties to the notorious Gang of Four, which ruled in Mao's name during his final years. Mr. Huang was named foreign minister and then vice prime minister. He retired in 1992.

 He is survived by his wife, He Liliang; three children, and several grandchildren.","The New York Times                             November 25, 2010 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Huang Hua, 97, a Diplomat Who Served China, Dies"
"Nellie King, a former Pirates pitcher who became a popular announcer for the club, died Wednesday.",19574,2010-08-13 00:00:00,"PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Nellie King, a former Pirates pitcher who became a popular announcer for the club, died Wednesday. He was 82.

 The cause was colon cancer and pneumonia, according to Duquesne University, where he worked from 1975 to 1992 as the sports information director.

 A 6-foot-6 right-hander, he grew up in Hershey, Pa., and had modest success as a pitcher for the Pirates. He went 7-5 while appearing in 95 games from 1954 to 1957, all but four as a reliever.

 After his playing career ended, Mr. King became a broadcaster in suburban Pittsburgh. In 1967, he was hired to work alongside Bob Prince and Jim Woods as an announcer.

 After Mr. Woods left to replace Harry Caray in St. Louis in 1970, Mr. King and Mr. Prince worked as partners until Mr. Prince's ouster in 1975 led the Pirates to also fire Mr. King.

 The duo was a contrast in styles -- Mr. Prince was loud and colorful, Mr. King was soft-spoken and an expert interviewer -- but they worked well together on broadcasts that beamed to much of the East Coast on the 50,000-watt radio station KDKA. Their firings angered numerous Pirates fans, and about 15,000 turned out for a downtown parade urging the team to rehire Mr. Prince and Mr. King.

 The team later acknowledged that the firings had been a major mistake that alienated longtime fans. Mr. Prince came back briefly in 1985 and died later that year, but Mr. King never returned to the Pirates' broadcast booth on a full-time basis.","The New York Times                               August 13, 2010 Friday                               Late Edition - Final  Nellie King, 82, Pirates Announcer"

 The cause was cancer, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a statement.

 Mr. White, a Democrat, had been ill for some time and last attended a Council meeting in April, said Jamie McShane, a spokesman for the City Council. Mr. White represented the 28th District in southeast Queens, which includes Jamaica, South Jamaica and Richmond Hill.

 Mr. White first took office in 1991, and as councilman he made economic development and tackling substance abuse two of his primary causes. He was the chairman of the Council's Economic Development Committee and a founder and executive director of J-CAP, one of the largest substance abuse treatment programs in the state.

 He also pushed for job-training programs and initiatives that helped the poor and protected victims of violence, said Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker.

 ''He had a particular soft spot for women and minority business owners, pushing for additional resources to help them stay afloat and create good jobs for their neighbors,'' she said in a statement.

 Mr. White left office in 2001 because of term limits, but he was elected to his old seat five years ago and was re-elected last year.

"Paul Kolton, who became the first full-time paid chairman of the American Stock Exchange without ever having worked as a stockbroker, died on Wednesday in Stamford, Conn., where he lived.",19830,2010-11-01 00:00:00,"Paul Kolton, who became the first full-time paid chairman of the American Stock Exchange without ever having worked as a stockbroker, died on Wednesday in Stamford, Conn., where he lived. He was 87.

 The cause was lymphoma, his daughter, Shelley Kolton, said.

 When Mr. Kolton was named president of the Amex in 1971, it was the first time an in-house employee, rather than a leading figure from the financial world, was put atop one of the major securities exchanges. He was elevated to chairman, a newly created post, a year later after the Amex's board was reorganized.

 Mr. Kolton reached that position without ever having served as a stockbroker. A former reporter for The New York Journal of Commerce and a mystery writer, he landed his first Wall Street job working in public relations for the Amex's bigger rival, the New York Stock Exchange.

 Much of Mr. Kolton's tenure at the Amex was spent fending off the idea that the exchange should merge with the New York Stock Exchange. ''Two independent, viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution,'' he said at the beginning of his presidency.

 During his tenure, the Amex, to great fanfare, introduced options trading in 1975, two years after the founding of the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

 After retiring from the Amex in 1977, Mr. Kolton was chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council and a director of several companies, including Standard Brands and Caldor.

 He ended up outliving the stock exchange whose independence he had defended. The Amex was acquired by NYSE Euronext in 2008.

 Mr. Kolton was born Paul Komisaruk on June 1, 1923, in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. He served as a sergeant in the Army in World War II and later graduated from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

 Returning to New York City, he wrote mystery stories for magazines and changed his last name to Kolton because, his daughter said, he liked it as a pen name. He joined the public relations staff at the New York Stock Exchange in 1955 and rose to vice president. He left in 1962 to become executive vice president at the Amex, the stock exchange's No. 2 position.

"Jack Kershaw, who represented James Earl Ray as he fought to overturn his conviction in the assassination of the Rev.",19704,2010-09-26 00:00:00,"Jack Kershaw, who represented James Earl Ray as he fought to overturn his conviction in the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., arguing that Ray was an innocent participant in a conspiracy led by a mysterious figure named Raul, died Sept. 7. in Nashville. He was 96.

 His death was announced by the League of the South, an organization Mr. Kershaw helped found that tries to keep the spirit of the Confederacy alive.

 Mr. Kershaw, who was also a sculptor, was best known in his hometown for creating a 27-foot equestrian statue of the Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Unveiled in 1998, it was erected in a private park along Interstate 65.

 The monument, offensive to many, drew criticism, but Mr. Kershaw did not shy from offending. ''Somebody needs to say a good word for slavery,'' he once told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans.

 Mr. Kershaw's principal brush with history came in representing Ray in 1977 in the killing of Dr. King in Memphis in 1968. On the advice of another lawyer, Percy Foreman, Ray had pleaded guilty in a Tennessee state court to being Dr. King's sole murderer. If he had been convicted at trial, he would have received an automatic death sentence. Instead, he was sentenced to 99 years in prison.

 Ray, a career petty criminal, soon argued that he had been coerced into pleading guilty. Without specifics, he blamed a man he identified only as Raul, whom he said he had met in Montreal. Ray denied shooting Dr. King but said murkily that he might have been ''partially responsible without knowing it.''

 Mr. Kershaw pushed this vague conspiracy claim. He accompanied Ray to interviews with investigators from the House of Representatives' Select Committee on Assassinations, which was looking again at the killings of Dr. King and President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Kershaw persuaded the committee to conduct further ballistics tests on the rifle and the bullet that killed Dr. King. The tests were said to be inconclusive.

 Mr. Kershaw told the panel in May 1977 that on the day of Dr. King's killing, April 4, 1968, Ray was working for Raul, and that Raul had told him to go out to a movie that afternoon. (Dr. King was shot shortly after 6 p.m. as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel.) Instead, he said, Ray went to have a spare tire fixed. The lawyer could not produce a witness.

 An article in The New York Times the next month repeated Mr. Kershaw's contention that Ray was guilty only of having ''bought a gun for what he thought was a gun-smuggling operation.''

 In June 1977, Ray and five other inmates escaped from a Tennessee high-security penitentiary, only to be caught days later. Mr. Kershaw argued that the escape required help from outsiders and that this was further evidence of a conspiracy.

 But Ray grew disenchanted with Mr. Kershaw after he persuaded Ray to be interviewed by Playboy magazine and submit to a lie-detector test for the article. The results indicated that Ray was lying when he said he did not kill Dr. King and that he was telling the truth when he denied he was part of a conspiracy. Playboy said the results proved ''that Ray did, in fact, kill Martin Luther King Jr. and that he did so alone.''

 The last straw came when Ray learned that Mr. Kershaw had accepted $11,000 from Playboy. He fired Mr. Kershaw and replaced him with Mark Lane, a lawyer, author and conspiracy theorist.

 John Karl Kershaw was born in Missouri on Oct. 12, 1913, and moved to Old Hickory, Tenn., as a child. He attended Vanderbilt, where he played football and graduated with a geology degree; became a building contractor; and earned his law degree at the Nashville Y.M.C.A. Night Law School.

 Mr. Kershaw left no immediate survivors. His wife, the former Mary Noel, died in 1989.

"Hugh L. Carey, the governor who helped rescue New York from the brink of financial collapse in the 1970s and tamed a culture of ever-growing spending, died Sunday at his summer home on Shelter Island, N.Y.",49351,2011-08-08 00:00:00,"Hugh L. Carey, the governor who helped rescue New York from the brink of financial collapse in the 1970s and tamed a culture of ever-growing spending, died Sunday at his summer home on Shelter Island, N.Y. He was 92.

 His death was announced by the office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. ''Governor Carey led our state during a time of great financial turmoil and pulled us back from the brink of bankruptcy and economic ruin,'' Mr. Cuomo said in the statement.

 From 1975 through 1982, as the state's 51st governor, Mr. Carey led a small group of public servants who vanquished the fiscal crisis that threatened New York City and State -- the direst emergency a governor had faced since the Depression -- by taking on powers over the city's finances that no governor had wielded before and none has wielded since.

 A liberal Democrat, Mr. Carey reversed the upward spiral of borrowing, spending and entitlement under one of his predecessors, Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican who had presided in an era of limitless government promise. But even after eight years as governor, Mr. Carey remained an enigma. The witty storyteller who could charm an audience alternated with the irascible loner who alienated many of his allies. The brooding, private man, father of more than a dozen children, who mourned the deaths of his wife and, earlier, two sons killed in a car crash, gave way to a man who engaged in an exuberant, very public romance that led to a second marriage.

 Hugh Carey rose to power as a Democrat outside his party's machine. He began the 1974 campaign for governor as a recently widowed congressman from Brooklyn, a long shot who was not taken seriously, yet he cruised to one of the most resounding victories in the state's history.

 But he spent his final years as governor frustrated. Absent an emergency, he often seemed bored with the job.

 The political strategist David Garth, who was one of Mr. Carey's closest associates, once said of him: ''Hugh Carey on the petty issues can be very petty. On the big stuff, he is terrific.''

 Mr. Carey's stature grew in his decades out of office, and he was hailed as a hero by Republicans and Democrats. As he acknowledged, his handling of government finances overshadowed all else he did. In an interview in 1982 in his last days in office, he said, ''The objectives I set forth I've achieved in terms of a state that's respected fiscally, a city that's now well on its way back to concrete foundations.''

 In four terms as governor, Mr. Rockefeller had built a legacy of state universities and highways but also of much higher taxes and enormous debt. The pattern was repeated at the local level; under Mayor John V. Lindsay, a Republican turned Democrat, New York City had to borrow money for day-to-day operations. The 1974-75 recession opened yawning deficits and exposed years of unsound practices.

 Cascade of Emergencies

 On Jan. 1, 1975, Mr. Carey declared in his inaugural address, ''This government will begin today the painful, difficult, imperative process of learning to live within its means.''

 He immediately faced a cascade of emergencies, as various state authorities, New York City, Yonkers, several school districts and ultimately the state itself flirted with collapse.

 New York City lay at the core of the crisis. Mr. Lindsay's successor as mayor, Abraham D. Beame, was taking drastic action, cutting tens of thousands of jobs, but a solution lay beyond the city's grasp. In May 1975, Wall Street firms refused to sell the city's bonds, threatening its ability to pay its bills.

 Mr. Carey responded with a series of audacious moves to keep the city afloat. He created the Municipal Assistance Corporation to borrow money for the city. He created and headed the Emergency Financial Control Board, with the power to reject city budgets and labor contracts, giving him vast new authority at Mr. Beame's expense.

 By seizing control of the city's finances, and then telling the mayor that he had to fire his closest aide to placate the bankers, Mr. Carey permanently soured his relationship with Mr. Beame, who had helped him get elected. But such tough measures were necessary to keep the enterprise afloat. Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker whom the governor appointed to head the Municipal Assistance Corporation, later said of Mr. Carey, ''He was the only one who had any credibility left.''

 The governor engineered more than $1 billion in state loans to the city and $200 million in new city taxes. He persuaded banks to refinance city debts and accept a moratorium on some debt payments, and he got municipal unions to invest their pension funds in Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds.

 Despite those measures, New York City at one point came within hours having to file for bankruptcy.

 On Oct. 29, 1975, President Gerald R. Ford vowed that he would veto ''any bill that has as its purpose a federal bailout of New York City.'' The next day, the front page of The Daily News famously proclaimed: ''Ford to City: Drop Dead.''

 A fierce backlash ensued, and a chastened Mr. Ford was persuaded that the governor had the situation under control. The president agreed in early 1976 to $2.3 billion in federal loan guarantees to the city. The greatest peril had passed.

 In all, Mr. Carey wrought profound changes, curtailing the entitlements that had been a defining element of New York government. The state wrested primary control of the City University of New York from the city, ending tuition-free education. It took over the city's courts. Subway and bus fares were raised and raised again, and welfare payments were frozen despite high inflation.

 In his first five years, Mr. Carey reduced state spending 13 percent when adjusted for inflation, and despite increases forced on him by the Legislature in later years, the budget was smaller in real terms when he left office than when he arrived. He cut state taxes, and city taxes declined over all as well. And most striking, the city and state eliminated more than 100,000 jobs.

 Outside the fiscal realm, Mr. Carey promised an era of openness and clean government. He mandated financial disclosure for top state officials, barred party leaders from holding major state posts and signed campaign finance laws that set limits and required disclosure. He secured voter approval of a constitutional amendment providing for appointment, rather than election, of judges to the Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, a change that was viewed as insulating the court from politics.

 He ordered an investigation of nursing homes that resulted in the convictions of several nursing-home operators and workers on fraud charges, and the recovery of millions of dollars in government payments. And he helped bring the Democratic National Convention to Madison Square Garden for the first time in a half-century in 1976 and again in 1980.

 Like so many New York governors, Mr. Carey harbored presidential ambitions, but trouble at home doomed any hope he might have had. His austerity measures made him unpopular with many voters, and his support for Westway, a proposed highway along the West Side of Manhattan, made more enemies than friends.

 Unprecedented Affront

 In 1978, when Mr. Carey ran for a second term, he was challenged in the primary by his own lieutenant governor, Mary Anne Krupsak, an unheard-of affront to a sitting governor. He began the general election campaign lagging in polls behind the Republican candidate, Perry B. Duryea, a former Assembly speaker. But capitalizing on Mr. Duryea's refusal to disclose his personal finances, he managed a narrow victory.

 Mr. Carey could be remarkably free of egotism, sharing credit liberally with others and readily deferring to his aides. He brought into government an impressive cadre of people who cast long shadows years after he had left office, including Mario M. Cuomo, his second lieutenant governor, who succeeded him as governor (and whose son is the current governor); Richard Ravitch, a lieutenant governor under Gov. David A. Paterson; and Mr. Rohatyn.

 But Mr. Carey eventually feuded with nearly everyone around him, beginning with Ms. Krupsak, who felt ignored. In 1977, he helped orchestrate the downfall of his old ally, Mr. Beame, after one term as mayor. He encouraged Mario Cuomo's challenge of Mr. Beame's renomination, but Congressman Edward I. Koch defeated them both and became mayor.

 Mr. Carey's relations with the Legislature turned rocky in his second term. A new Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Stanley Fink, asserted his house as an independent force.

 The governor let legislators know that he considered them petty and parochial, while they accused him of being distant from the business at hand. Even Mr. Carey's detractors said he was brilliant at sizing up problems and conceiving solutions, but aides and legislators alike agreed that he had little patience for seeing them through.

 In 1981 and 1982, the Legislature cut him out of the budget-making process; when he vetoed dozens of spending items, both houses overrode his vetoes. He was the first governor of New York in a century to have a veto overridden.

 In 1982, the state approved the most significant legislation of his second term, an $8 billion package to restore New York City's crumbling transit system. But that was largely the doing of legislators and Mr. Ravitch, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The governor had been reduced to a bystander.

 In his second term, Mr. Carey acquired a reputation for erratic behavior, which he attributed to people's misunderstanding his offbeat, deadpan humor. He created a furor by saying that one of New York's seats in the United States Senate had been and should remain ''a Jewish seat.'' He sought state condemnation of a neighbor's property on Shelter Island, on the East End of Long Island, over a private feud. He offered to drink a glass of PCBs to allay fears of contamination at a state office building where an electrical transformer fire had spread soot laden with the toxic chemical.

 But it was his marriage to Evangeline Gouletas, a wealthy real estate investor, that made the governor seem, to many people, downright eccentric. They met at the inauguration of Ronald Reagan as president in January 1981 and married less than three months later. Ms. Gouletas said that she had been married twice before and that her first husband had died, but shortly after her wedding to Mr. Carey, reporters discovered that she had three former husbands, all quite alive.

 Bon Vivant

 To the dismay of his staff, the governor began dyeing his silver hair -- not always quite the same shade -- and including his wife in policy discussions. The newlyweds were often seen out dancing, and they turned up regularly at black-tie events; Mr. Carey suddenly seemed more bon vivant than sober executive.

 Finally, it became clear that he would be challenged by other Democrats if he ran for a third term. Although Mr. Carey had been a prime sponsor of Mr. Cuomo's political career, their relationship had so deteriorated that Mr. Cuomo, as Ms. Krupsak had done, was considering running against his political mentor.

 In January 1982, Governor Carey announced that at the end of his term later that year, at age 63, he would retire from politics. After leaving office, he became a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Finley Kumble Wagner Heine Underberg & Casey. Later he worked with other law firms and was an executive at the chemicals conglomerate W. R. Grace & Company. He and Ms. Gouletas divorced after several years. Mr. Carey quickly faded from the public eye, though he turned up occasionally at the Capitol in Albany to bask in encomiums for his handling of the fiscal crisis.

 ''When he focuses and buckles down to a problem, he's effective,'' Warren M. Anderson, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, said in 1982 as Mr. Carey's second term was ending. ''I don't know why he doesn't do it more uniformly. He almost seemed to need a crisis to motivate him.''

 Last year, the State Legislature voted to rename the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel after Mr. Carey. Mr. Koch applauded the move, saying: ''I have been trying for years to get something named for Hugh Carey. I think he's the greatest governor of the modern era.''

 Hugh Leo Carey was born on April 11, 1919, in Park Slope, Brooklyn, the fourth of five sons of Margaret and Denis J. Carey, both children of Irish immigrants. Denis Carey founded a successful business delivering fuel oil and kerosene, and the family lived comfortably.

 Hugh Carey followed an educational path well worn by Brooklyn's Irish Catholic sons: St. Augustine's Academy and High School, St. John's College. He left school to enlist in a National Guard cavalry unit in 1939, at a time when the cavalry still rode horses. Years later he would regale upstate audiences with tales of his equestrian experiences at Camp Drum, near Watertown, providing a local touch that voters relished. When his unit was activated, he was transferred to the infantry.

 He fought with the 104th Division in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, helping to capture Cologne and liberate prisoners at a concentration camp at Nordhausen. At his discharge in 1946, he was a lieutenant colonel, wearing the Bronze Star, the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.

 In 1947 he married Helen Owen Twohy, the widow of a Navy flier killed in the war, and adopted her daughter. They had 13 more children together and divided their time between Park Slope and a rambling white house with a wraparound porch on Shelter Island that in time became the family homestead.

 Mr. Carey is survived by his daughters, Alexandria McManus, Susan Dempsey, Marianne Hayes, Nancy Cassidy and Helen O'Neill; his sons Christopher, Michael, Donald, Bryan, Kevin and Thomas; his brothers Denis, John and Martin; 25 grandchildren and 6 great grand-children.

 After the war, Mr. Carey returned to St. John's, where he finished his undergraduate education and graduated from law school. He then entered the family oil business. His eldest brother, Edward, struck out on his own, creating the New England Petroleum Corporation and amassing a fortune that would help underwrite his brother's political career.

 Challenging an Incumbent

 In 1960, Hugh Carey ran for Congress in a Brooklyn district that stretched from Park Slope to Bay Ridge, challenging a popular Republican incumbent, Francis E. Dorn. Though Mr. Carey was not one of its own, the Democratic Party organization backed him because no one else wanted what was viewed as a hopeless assignment. Running in a strongly Catholic district in a year when John F. Kennedy was pulling Catholics to the Democratic line, Mr. Carey squeezed out a 1,097-vote victory.

 In seven terms in Congress, Mr. Carey ranked high on the scorecards of liberal groups and adhered to positions like opposing the death penalty even when they were unpopular. But in keeping with the tone of his district, he portrayed himself as a moderate, playing up his support for federal aid to parochial schools.

 In Congress he became one of the most influential members of the New York delegation. He sat on the House Education and Labor Committee, which handled most of the New Frontier and Great Society social welfare legislation of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and later on the powerful Ways and Means Committee.

 But Mr. Carey became restless, and he and his wife grew tired of commuting to and from Washington with their many children.

 In 1969, he ran for mayor of New York as an independent, angering Democratic Party leaders and prompting predictions of his political demise. But his sons Peter and Hugh Jr., both teenagers, were killed in a car accident on Shelter Island, and Mr. Carey abandoned the race. Another son, Paul, died of cancer in 2001.

 Mr. Carey considered another run for mayor in 1973 but deferred to a fellow Brooklyn Democrat, Mr. Beame. That year, Helen Carey, who had been treated for cancer three years earlier, learned that the disease had returned, and on a family trip to Ireland, Mr. Carey decided to retire from politics.

 In December 1973, however, he saw the political opening he had sought, when Mr. Rockefeller resigned as governor, leaving Lt. Gov. Malcolm Wilson to serve the year remaining on his term. Democratic Party leaders backed Howard J. Samuels, the president of the Off-Track Betting Corporation, for governor, and Mr. Carey was seen as a long shot.

 On March 8, 1974, Helen Carey died. Her husband, with seven school-age children still at home, was expected to bow out of the race. But on March 26, he announced his candidacy. Friends said that as much as anything, he needed the challenge to distract him from his grief.

 When he said that his brother would spend $1 million on television advertising to help his candidacy, the boast was viewed with skepticism, but Edward Carey spent that and more.

 In September, he defeated Mr. Samuels with 61 percent of the vote. In November, in the national post-Watergate sweep by Democrats, Mr. Carey trounced Governor Wilson, 57 percent to 42 percent.

 ''All my life, people have been underestimating me,'' Mr. Carey often said. In rising to power, he repeatedly ignored the conventional wisdom and trusted his own judgment, and he would again as governor.

 Years later, he told a reporter: ''A mentor long departed told me that the greatest gift in political life, in any life, is to view yourself objectively, at arm's length, to make an assessment of yourself. So whom do I rely on? I rely on myself.''","The New York Times                               August 8, 2011 Monday                               Late Edition - Final  HUGH L.

"Bill Monroe, a television journalist whose long career with NBC included stints as the network's Washington bureau chief and moderator of its Sunday interview program, ''Meet the Press,'' died on Thursday at a nursing home in Potomac, Md.",2361,2011-02-18 00:00:00,"Bill Monroe, a television journalist whose long career with NBC included stints as the network's Washington bureau chief and moderator of its Sunday interview program, ''Meet the Press,'' died on Thursday at a nursing home in Potomac, Md. He was 90.

 The cause was complications of hypertension, his daughter Lee Monroe said. He moved to the nursing home after taking a fall in December.

 From 1975 to 1984, Mr. Monroe was the producer and moderator of ''Meet the Press,'' the long-running Sunday morning news program built around interviews with national and international figures. He was its fourth producer and moderator, succeeding Lawrence E. Spivak, after serving as a panelist himself.

 On camera Mr. Monroe was serious and direct. In 1976, soon after becoming the permanent moderator, he grilled Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, who had once championed segregation and was running for president. ''Have you personally changed your views about segregation?'' Mr. Monroe asked.

 When Mr. Wallace did not respond directly, Mr. Monroe interrupted him and repeated the question twice more. Mr. Wallace went on to say that race relations were better in the South than in other parts of the country.

 In 1980, President Jimmy Carter used a ''Meet the Press'' interview with Mr. Monroe to announce that the United States would boycott the Olympics in Moscow that year to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

 Mr. Monroe was previously Washington editor of the ''Today'' show; before that he was NBC's Washington bureau chief. He was succeeded on ''Meet the Press'' by the co-hosts Marvin Kalb and Roger Mudd and later returned to ''Today'' to present a broadcast equivalent of newspapers' letters-to-the-editor columns. People who wrote compelling letters were interviewed in their homes or places of work.

 After retiring from NBC in 1986, Mr. Monroe was editor of The Washington Journalism Review and worked for the Defense Department as ombudsman for Stars and Stripes, the military newspaper. His last job was editing The Early Bird, a compendium of newspaper stories the Pentagon sent to bases around the world.

 William Blanc Monroe Jr. was born in New Orleans on July 17, 1920, and graduated from Tulane University with a degree in philosophy and a Phi Beta Kappa key in 1942. He worked for United Press while in college and served in the Army Air Forces in the Mediterranean during World War II.

 After the war he worked as a newsman on local radio and a local newspaper in New Orleans before becoming news director of WDSU's AM, FM and television stations in New Orleans.

 As part of the job he began writing editorials and delivering them himself, many of which called for calm during the early days of the civil rights movement. Some editorials provoked death threats.

 In 1959, WDSU-TV won a George Foster Peabody Award for work done under Mr. Monroe's direction. He also won a Peabody in 1973 for his news reporting on the ''Today'' show.

 Early in his career, Mr. Monroe fought for greater press access to courtrooms and legislative chambers. In 1972, he testified before Congress to criticize the fairness doctrine of the Federal Communications Commission. Saying he was speaking for himself and not NBC, he argued that instead of being licensed and regulated by the F.C.C., broadcasters should be accorded the same unfettered First Amendment rights as newspapers.

 He testified that the regulatory system led broadcasters to fear that Congress or the F.C.C. would discipline them for political reasons. The result, he said, was that they felt ''boldness equals trouble with the government, blandness equals peace.''

 In addition to his daughter Lee, Mr. Monroe is survived by three other daughters, Arthe Monroe Phillips, Catherine Monroe and Maria Monroe Poole; five grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.","The New York Times                              February 18, 2011 Friday                               Late Edition - Final  Bill Monroe, Former 'Meet the Press' Host, Dies at 90"
"Danielle Mitterrand, the widow of former President Francois Mitterrand of France, who pushed beyond stereotypical notions of a first lady to champion leftist causes, once kissing Fidel Castro on the steps of the Elysee Palace, died on Tuesday in Paris.",54526,2011-11-23 00:00:00,"Danielle Mitterrand, the widow of former President Francois Mitterrand of France, who pushed beyond stereotypical notions of a first lady to champion leftist causes, once kissing Fidel Castro on the steps of the Elysee Palace, died on Tuesday in Paris. She was 87.

 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France announced the death. Mrs. Mitterrand entered a hospital on Friday with respiratory problems and was put in an induced coma on Sunday, French news reports said.

 When Mr. Mitterrand, a Socialist, became president in 1981, Mrs. Mitterrand made it clear that she had no enthusiasm for the traditional first-lady roles of hostess, decorator and good-will ambassador. During her husband's 14-year incumbency, the longest of any French president, Mrs. Mitterrand spoke up for ethnic Kurds, criticized President Ronald Reagan's Central American policies and started a foundation to promote human rights.

 After his presidency she continued to press her concerns, including drinking-water shortages in developing countries.

 ''I have no power,'' she said in an interview with The Washington Post in 1989. ''I have only my power of indignation, my power of conviction.''

 She also had the ear of the most powerful politician in France. ''Francois would tell the complainers: 'Her causes are just, I can't stop defending them,' '' she told Le Journal du Dimanche, a French weekly newspaper, in October.

 Mrs. Mitterrand was regarded as more leftist than her husband, who was elected leader of the Socialist Party in 1971 and invited Communists into his government in 1981. Catherine Nay, in her 1984 biography, ''The Black and the Red: Francois Mitterrand, the Story of an Ambition,'' quoted him as saying in 1972, ''She considers me much too moderate in my political life.''

 It was she who invited Mr. Castro to Paris in 1995; her husband's government emphasized that it was not a state visit.

 Mrs. Mitterrand made a large international impression at her husband's funeral in 1996. At the grave site, along with two of her sons with Mr. Mitterrand, she stood near his longtime mistress, Anne Pingeot, a museum curator, and his long-secret daughter with Ms. Pingeot, Mazarine Pingeot. She was photographed consoling the daughter. ''It was instinct,'' Mrs. Mitterrand said.

 In her 1996 memoir, ''En Toute Liberte'' (''In All Liberty''), she wrote that she had known about the daughter since her birth in 1974. Mr. Mitterrand, she said, ''excelled in the art of seducing.''

 ''I had to make the best of it,'' she wrote.

 She more than forgave him; she defended him, saying his puritanical critics exhibited ''this hypocrisy of conformity.''

 Danielle Gouze was born on Oct. 29, 1924, in Verdun in eastern France, site of the horrific World War I battle. During World War II her father lost his job as a school principal after refusing to identify Jews in the school, as ordered by France's Vichy government, which collaborated with the occupying Nazis. She joined the underground resistance as a nurse at 17 in Burgundy and won the Medal of Resistance.

 The story goes that Mr. Mitterrand, also a resistance fighter, first saw Danielle in a photograph at her sister's home. ''She's quite ravishing,'' he said. ''I'll marry her.''

 They married on her 20th birthday. The war accelerated their courtship. ''When death hovers above you, your feelings multiply quickly,'' she recalled in Franz-Oliver Geisbert's authorized biography, ''Francois Mitterrand.''

 Mrs. Mitterrand, a petite brunette with striking eyes, characterized her appearance as ''simple.'' Unlike her predecessors, she did not frequent the haute couture. As a hobby she became an accomplished bookbinder.

 She is survived by her sons Gilbert and Jean-Christophe. Her son Pascal died very young.

 Mrs. Mitterrand's political involvement accelerated after her husband left office in 1995. She campaigned for the release of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther who has been on death row in the killing of a white police officer in Philadelphia. In 2005, she urged a ''no'' vote in the French referendum on a European Union constitution, saying it valued the economy more than people. It was soundly rejected.

 In a message on the Web site of her foundation, France Fondation Danielle Mitterrand, she explained why she never lost her strong public voice. ''After a certain age,'' she said, ''people go to sleep. As for me, I have no intention of dying by inches.''","The New York Times                            November 23, 2011 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  Danielle Mitterrand, 87, Wife Of an Ex-President of France"
Ray C. Anderson was chairman and chief executive of the world's largest carpet-tile manufacturer when he read a book that described people like him as thieves and plunderers of the planet. He saw the author's point.,49365,2011-08-11 00:00:00,"Ray C. Anderson was chairman and chief executive of the world's largest carpet-tile manufacturer when he read a book that described people like him as thieves and plunderers of the planet. He saw the author's point. He even wept. Then he set out to change things.

 Mr. Anderson, an avowed ''recovering plunderer'' who re-invented his worldwide factory operation to reduce its environmental impact and became one of the nation's most effective corporate advocates for environmental sustainability, died on Tuesday at his home in Atlanta. He was 77. His family said the cause was cancer.

 Starting in the early 1970s, Mr. Anderson built a company based in Atlanta, Interface Inc., into a $1.1 billion a year concern manufacturing carpet, fabric and upholstery used in offices and commercial buildings.

 By the time of his epiphany in 1994, Mr. Anderson was a 60-year-old executive who had given little thought to the environment except as a matter of compliance with government regulations, he said.

 After 1994, he seemed to think about nothing else -- crisscrossing the country with a near-evangelical fervor, telling fellow executives about the need to reduce waste and carbon emissions.

 Those efforts drew praise from environmental organizations and earned him an appointment to a White House environmental commission under President Bill Clinton.

 They also helped his company's bottom line. ''What started out as the right thing to do quickly became the smart thing,'' he told a business group in Toronto in 2005. ''Cost savings from eliminating waste alone have been $262 million.''

 In his speeches, Mr. Anderson credited that book, ''The Ecology of Commerce'' by Paul Hawken, with changing his perspective. He described reading it as a ''spear in the chest experience.''

 ''I read on and was dumbfounded by how much I did not know about the environment, and the impacts of the industrial system on the environment -- the industrial system of which I and my 'successful' company were an integral part,'' he said in a 2005 speech.

 ''A new definition of success burst into my consciousness, and the latent sense of legacy asserted itself. I got it. I was a plunderer of Earth, and that is not the legacy one wants to leave behind. I wept.''

 Efforts he began have so far reduced the so-called carbon footprint of the company's 26 factories by about half, said the current chief executive, Dan Hendrix.

 ''When he first came up with this idea, I have to admit I thought he'd gone around the bend,'' Mr. Hendrix said Wednesday. ''But he was right.''

 Ralph Nader, who became friendly with Mr. Anderson after hearing one of his speeches several years ago, called him ''the greatest educator of his peers in industry, and the most knowledgeable motivator, by example and vision, for the environmental movement.''

 Ray Christie Anderson was born July 28, 1934, in rural West Point, Ga., the youngest of three children of William Henry Anderson, a postal worker, and Ruth McGinty, a teacher. He received a football scholarship to Georgia Institute of Technology and graduated in 1956 with a degree in systems engineering.

 In 1973, Mr. Anderson became one of the first manufacturers in the United States to produce modular carpet, which provided for easier access to wiring and infrastructure beneath floors than broadloom carpet. Interface became the largest manufacturer of modular carpet in the world.

 His survivors include his wife of 27 years, Patricia Adams Anderson; two daughters from a previous marriage, Mary Anne Lanier, of Marietta, Ga., and Harriet Langford, of LaGrange, Ga., and a brother, Dr. William Anderson, of Conneaut, Ohio.

 In one of his first speeches after reading Mr. Hawken's book, Mr. Anderson told an audience of business executives: ''We are all part of the continuum of humanity and life. We will have lived our brief span and either helped or hurt that continuum and the earth that sustains all life. It's that simple. Which will it be?''","The New York Times                              August 11, 2011 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Ray Anderson, a Carpet Innovator, Dies at 77"
"Alfred Brittain 3d, who reshaped the giant Bankers Trust New York Corporation as its chairman and chief executive in the 1970s and '80s, died last Saturday at his home in Greenwich, Conn.",2432,2011-03-12 00:00:00,"Alfred Brittain 3d, who reshaped the giant Bankers Trust New York Corporation as its chairman and chief executive in the 1970s and '80s, died last Saturday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 88.

 The cause was heart failure, said Ted Hampton, a stepson.

 Mr. Brittain was part of a ''youth movement'' that took over American banking in the 1960s and '70s. When he was appointed president of Bankers Trust in 1966, at age 43, he became the youngest president of a major New York bank.

 As its top executive from 1975 to 1987 -- when Bankers Trust was one of the nation's 10 largest banks -- Mr. Brittain helped it recover from large real estate losses, sold branches, got out of retail banking and expanded what became a very lucrative merchant-banking business. His focus on providing financial services exclusively to corporations, governments and municipal agencies helped increase profits.

 Mr. Brittain's shift from retail banking helped pave the way for changes in the banking industry that led to the rise of increasingly sophisticated financial instruments that came to define and eventually overwhelm the financial sector. His successor, Charles Sanford, moved Bankers Trust into the market for derivatives.

 In moving from commercial to investment banking -- which Mr. Brittain referred to as financial services -- Bankers Trust withstood complaints by securities firms that it had violated the Glass-Steagall Act, a 1933 law that separated commercial and investment banks. The bank lobbied for the law's repeal. Congress repealed it in 1999.

 Bankers Trust was bought by Deutsche Bank for $10 billion in 1998 in the largest foreign takeover of an American bank at the time.

 A frequent spokesman for the industry, Mr. Brittain represented major banks in contentious, and very public, negotiations with Mayor Abraham D. Beame and labor unions during New York City's fiscal crisis in 1977. Mr. Brittain was a soft-spoken and understated executive, prompting some bank officers to complain that they sometimes could hardly hear him talk. He made a point of eating with employees regularly at the company cafeteria. ''I get a lot of good gossip at those lunches,'' he once told an interviewer.

 ''When I started here 32 years ago, bankers were doing business on the golf course,'' Mr. Brittain said in another interview, in 1979. ''That has all but disappeared.''

 Alfred Brittain 3d was born in 1922 in Evanston, Ill., the Chicago suburb. His father was a vice president of the Bank of New York. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1941, served in the Army during World War II in the Pacific and graduated from Yale University in 1947. He joined Bankers Trust that same year as a credit investigator.

 Mr. Brittain was a director of Philip Morris for 25 years, until 1991. From 1982 to 1985 he was a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He retired from Bankers Trust in 1987 at the mandatory retirement age of 65.

 Mr. Brittain was an avid sailor as a member of the Riverside Yacht Club in Greenwich; as a boy he sailed on Lake Michigan in a 15 1/2-foot boat called Slopoke that his father had built from discarded wood, Mr. Hampton said. His office on Park Avenue had a teak desk and half a dozen paintings of sailboats.

 Mr. Brittain is survived by his wife, May McDonnell Brittain, whom he married in 1996, and two children from a first marriage, Stephen and Linda.

 His first wife, Beatrice Brittain, whom he married in 1948, died in 1988. His second wife, Lilly Middleton Hampton, whom he married in 1991, died in 1993. He is also survived by four granddaughters and six stepchildren.","The New York Times                              March 12, 2011 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Alfred Brittain, 88; Reshaped Bankers Trust"

Harding, the former leader of New York State's Liberal Party, who advanced the careers of mayors and governors but was disgraced in the corruption scandal that brought down State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, died on Thursday in the Bronx. He was 77.

 The cause was cancer, his son Robert said.

 Mr. Harding came from the Balkans as a boy, a wartime Jewish refugee whose father was beaten by the Nazis. His family survived refugee camps and a perilous Atlantic crossing through a gantlet of German U-boats. As a teenager, he took his new American name from a favorite radio program, ''David Harding, Counterspy.'' He became a lawyer and the protg of Alex Rose, the legendary founder of the Liberal Party.

 And from his rise to power in 1977 to his political demise when the Liberals lost their ballot line in 2002, Mr. Harding was one of the state's most resourceful power brokers, using his tiny but influential party to help elect Mario M. Cuomo as governor, Rudolph W. Giuliani as mayor, Mr. Hevesi as the city and state comptroller, and many other public officials.

 In return, Mr. Harding, a burly, chain-smoking back-room tactician whose endorsements kept his party alive long after critics called it irrelevant, won power and patronage. Using his influence at City Hall and in Albany, he secured high-profile government jobs for his allies, including his two sons, and reaped windfalls for himself.

 In 2009, however, he pleaded guilty to charges that he had taken $800,000 for doing favors for Mr. Hevesi -- acting as a sham intermediary to enable associates of the comptroller to obtain lucrative contracts to manage the state's $141 billion pension fund, and scheming to secure a State Assembly seat for Mr. Hevesi's son.

 Mr. Harding cooperated with a state investigation that led to the imprisonment of Mr. Hevesi and others. Felony charges against Mr. Harding were dropped, and at his own sentencing in 2011 on a single misdemeanor count he was spared jail time and allowed to keep the money he had taken. But it was a resounding humiliation for one of the last of New York's old-time political bosses.

 Like his predecessor, Mr. Rose, Mr. Harding helped to elect Republicans and Democrats by leveraging the Liberal Party's small membership -- only 1 percent of the voter rolls -- into something more important: a second place on the ballot for candidates, who thus acquired a sometimes undeserved imprimatur as progressives. It also gave disaffected Democratic and Republican voters a liberal line to assuage their consciences.

 Since New York is one of the few states that let a candidate add up votes as a multiple nominee, small parties have outsize influence as they endorse candidates or withhold support. In turn, they are guaranteed a line on the next statewide ballot if they receive at least 50,000 votes. By playing both ends against the middle, Mr. Harding could be a kingmaker and orchestrate his party's survival.

 For students of politics, watching Harding maneuvers was a rite of New York election seasons. He wore the tin crown of political kingpin with relish: a jowly, obese man with heavy eyelids, fingers stained yellow from unfiltered Camels, a rumbling voice and bespectacled gaze that many found intimidating. He was curt, and often spoke as if writing tabloid headlines aloud -- ''L.P.'' for the party, ''Libs'' for the faithful.

 Mr. Harding was an aide to Gov. Hugh L. Carey from 1975 to 1977. He became the Liberal Party leader after the 1976 death of Mr. Rose, who founded the party in 1944 with an agenda intended to keep Republicans liberal and Democrats honest. The party helped elect the Democrat Robert F. Wagner and the Republican John V. Lindsay as mayors; the Republican Jacob K. Javits as a senator; the Democrat Edward I. Koch as a young congressman; and Mr. Carey and Mr. Cuomo, both Democrats, as governors.

 Mr. Harding was never elected to any office and had scant use for ideology. An old joke had it that the Liberal Party was neither liberal nor a party. It held no primaries or conventions and had few candidates of its own. Mr. Harding decided which Democrats or Republicans to support with an eye to winning and its patronage rewards. His title was also a fiction: vice chairman with absolute power, the chairman being a figurehead.

 His wiliest move was said to have been his early embrace of Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, over the Democrat David N. Dinkins for mayor in 1989. Mr. Dinkins won that election, but after Mr. Giuliani won City Hall in 1993, Mr. Harding profited as a lobbyist and secured jobs for his sons, Robert, as budget director and deputy mayor, and Russell, as head of the Housing and Development Corporation, although he was a college dropout with no housing experience. But in 2005, Russell Harding was sentenced to five years in prison for embezzling $400,000 from the agency.

 Asked about criticism from Democrats for backing Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Harding said: ''Political parties serve a purpose. The purpose of the Liberal Party at that time was to rescue and restore this great city, and that required Giuliani's leadership.''

 The Liberal Party leader was born Branko Hochwald to Mane and Helen Hochwald on Jan. 31, 1935, in Croatia. As World War II moved through the Balkans, his father was attacked by Nazis and the family in 1941 escaped to Italy, taking refuge in a displaced persons' camp in Calabria.

 Wartime Jewish immigration to America was virtually prohibited, but in 1944 the Hochwalds were among 1,000 Jewish refugees granted safe haven by President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- the only large group of Jews admitted during the war -- as recounted in the book ''Haven,'' by the photojournalist Ruth Gruber.

 Raymond graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1953 and from City College in 1957 with a degree in political science. After Army service as an infantry officer, he earned a law degree at New York University in 1961.

 Besides his sons, Mr. Harding is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Elisabeth Einhorn, and two grandchildren.

 He practiced law for five years and from 1966 to 1969 was a lawyer for the city, investigating corrupt building inspectors. In 1975, he joined Governor Carey's staff as a disaster coordinator, military adviser and legislative liaison.

 Mr. Harding's influence, after peaking in the Giuliani years, waned in 2001 when he backed Mr. Hevesi in a race for mayor that was eventually won by Michael R. Bloomberg. In 2002, Mr. Harding endorsed Andrew M. Cuomo for governor. That proved to be a blunder when Mr. Cuomo quit the race. Without an active candidate, the Liberal Party fell far short of the votes needed for a place on the ballot.

 It was the coup de grce for the party and for Mr. Harding's political life. Snared in a subsequent state inquiry, Mr. Harding completed his fall by admitting in court that he had conspired to reward Mr. Hevesi's supporters with pension fund contracts and to secure an Assembly seat for his son, Andrew.

 ''I intentionally engaged in fraud and deception,'' he said. ''I wrongfully obtained $800,000 in fees relating to these transactions.''

"Reginald Bartholomew, a senior diplomat and ambassador who served four presidents, negotiated for nuclear disarmament with the Soviet Union and for the preservation of American military bases in Europe, and survived a bomb attack while he was ambassador to Lebanon in 1984, died on Sunday in Manhattan.",12518,2012-08-30 00:00:00,"Reginald Bartholomew, a senior diplomat and ambassador who served four presidents, negotiated for nuclear disarmament with the Soviet Union and for the preservation of American military bases in Europe, and survived a bomb attack while he was ambassador to Lebanon in 1984, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 76.

 The cause was cancer, said his wife, Rose-Anne.

 Mr. Bartholomew had already spent 15 years advising presidents and secretaries of state, and parachuting into places like Moscow and Cyprus to help extinguish diplomatic fires, when he received his first appointment as an ambassador, in 1983, to Lebanon. It was not a plush political posting. The day after he arrived that October, a Marine barracks was bombed by terrorists, killing 241 people. Mr. Bartholomew toured the scene the next day, his first full one on the job.

 The violence increased pressure for the United States to pull its troops. Mr. Bartholomew argued strongly against the idea. President Reagan delayed ordering the withdrawal until February 1984.

 Later that year, terrorists bombed the newly constructed United States Embassy near East Beirut, which had been built to replace one bombed the year before. Nine people were killed. Mr. Bartholomew was pulled from the rubble and, though not seriously wounded, needed stitches and a cast on his arm.

 Mr. Bartholomew remained in Lebanon for two more years and was often forced to leave for security reasons. His entourage sometimes encountered gunfire while traveling the country, with his personal security ''militia,'' as he and his wife called it, leaning out of car windows with automatic weapons to return fire.

 George P. Shultz, the secretary of state at the time, referred to Mr. Bartholomew as ''one of the best'' in the diplomatic corps.

 In 1986, Mr. Bartholomew was appointed ambassador to Spain, where he led negotiations to preserve a greatly reduced military presence. He had worked on similar negotiations before and would again later, in his final post, Italy, where he served as ambassador from 1993 to 1997.

 ''It was very hard,'' said Leslie H. Gelb, a former reporter at The New York Times who also worked with Mr. Bartholomew in the Defense and State Departments. ''We wanted the bases, and the foreign leaders wanted to show they were tough. They didn't want their people to think the United States owned them.''

 He added, referring to Mr. Bartholomew: ''He would be blunt, and lots of diplomats are not that blunt. He'd say, 'I know you've got your political problems, but let's figure out how to keep the bases and deal with your political problems.' ''

 Reginald Bartholomew was born Feb. 17, 1936, in Portland, Me. His father, Thomas (whose original family name was di Bartolomeo), and his mother, the former Corinne di Crecchio, both immigrated from Italy.

 Mr. Bartholomew was 20 and still a student at Dartmouth when he married Rose-Anne Dognin, who had moved to the United States from France and was a few years older. ''It was a grand, grand, grand ride, 56 years, and every bit of it has been exciting,'' Mrs. Bartholomew said in an interview Wednesday.

 Besides his wife, Mr. Bartholomew is survived by a brother, David; a daughter, Sylvie Bartholomew; three sons, Christian, Damien and Jonathan; and seven grandchildren.

 Mrs. Bartholomew said her husband knew he wanted to work overseas and passed the Foreign Service exam as a sophomore in college. After graduating from Dartmouth in 1958 with bachelor's degrees in history and political science, he went to graduate school at the University of Chicago. He received his master's in political science, did work toward his doctorate and taught at the university, in addition to spending a year in France studying French politics.

 In 1964 he took a job teaching European government and politics at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. Mr. Gelb was teaching there at the time, and they became friends.

 Mr. Gelb left to work as a policy adviser at the Pentagon in 1967 and persuaded Mr. Bartholomew to join him the next year. Both eventually moved to and from various departments in different roles, with Mr. Bartholomew working at the National Security Council during the Carter administration and later succeeding Mr. Gelb as the director of politico-military affairs at the State Department.

 Mr. Bartholomew played a key role in the SALT II arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union in 1979. After his tenure in Spain, he returned to Washington to serve as the under secretary for security affairs under Secretary of State James A. Baker III.

 Years earlier, Mr. Bartholomew was an aide to Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. One senior military official recalled Mr. Kissinger asking for Mr. Bartholomew at meetings on European policy.

 ''I realized quickly,'' the official recalled in an e-mail to Mr. Gelb, ''he was an indispensable man.''

"Yitzhak Shamir, who emerged from the militant wing of a Jewish militia and served as Israel's prime minister longer than anyone but David Ben-Gurion, promoting a muscular Zionism and expansive settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, died Saturday at a nursing home in Tel Aviv.",12308,2012-07-01 00:00:00,"Yitzhak Shamir, who emerged from the militant wing of a Jewish militia and served as Israel's prime minister longer than anyone but David Ben-Gurion, promoting a muscular Zionism and expansive settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, died Saturday at a nursing home in Tel Aviv. He was 96.

 Mr. Shamir had Alzheimer's disease for at least the last six years, an associate said. His death was announced by the prime minister's office.

 A native of Poland whose family was wiped out in the Holocaust, Mr. Shamir was part of a group of right-wing Israeli politicians led by Menachem Begin who rose to power in the 1970s as the more left-wing Labor Party declined, viewed as corrupt and disdainful of the public.

 Stubborn and laconic, Mr. Shamir was by his own assessment a most unlikely political leader whose very personality seemed the perfect representation of his government's policy of patient, determined, unyielding opposition to territorial concessions.

 Many of his friends and colleagues ascribed his character to his years in the underground in the 1940s, when he sent Jewish fighters out to kill British officers whom he saw as occupiers. He was a wanted man then; to the British rulers of the Palestine mandate he was a terrorist, an assassin. He appeared in public only at night, disguised as a Hasidic rabbi. But Mr. Shamir said he considered those ''the best years of my life.''

 His wife, Shulamit, once said that in the underground she and her husband had learned not to talk about their work for fear of being overheard. It was a habit he apparently never lost.

 Mr. Shamir was not blessed with a sharp wit, a soothing public manner or an engaging oratorical style. Most often he answered questions with a shrug and an air of weary wisdom, as if to say: ''This is so clear. Why do you even ask?''

 In 1988, at a meeting of the political party Herut, he sat slumped on a sofa, gazing at the floor as party stalwarts heaped praises on him. Shortly thereafter, he said: ''I like all those people, they're nice people. But this is not my style, not my language. This kind of meeting is the modern picture, but I don't belong to it.''

 Rather than bend to them, Mr. Shamir often simply outlasted his political opponents, who were usually much more willing to say what was on their minds, and sometimes to get in trouble for it. To Mr. Shamir, victory came not from compromise, but from strength, patience and cunning.

 ''If he wants something, it may take a long time, but he'll never let go,'' Avi Pazner, his media adviser, once remarked.

 In a statement on Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Mr. Shamir ''belonged to the generation of giants who founded the State of Israel and fought for the freedom of the Jewish people.''

 ''As prime minister,'' he added, ''Yitzhak Shamir took action to fortify Israel's security and ensure its future.''

 Prime Minister Begin appointed Mr. Shamir as foreign minister in 1980. When Mr. Begin suddenly retired in 1983, Mr. Shamir became a compromise candidate to replace him, alternating in the post with Shimon Peres for one four-year term. Mr. Shamir won his own term in 1988. He entered the political opposition when Yitzhak Rabin of the Labor Party was elected prime minister in 1992. Mr. Shamir retired from politics a few years later, at 81.

 A Hard-Line Approach

 As prime minister, Mr. Shamir promoted continued Jewish settlement in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which Israel conquered in 1967; the Jewish population in the occupied territories increased by nearly 30 percent while he was in office. He also encouraged the immigration of tens of thousands of Soviet Jews to Israel, an influx that changed the country's demographic character.

 One of the most notable events during his tenure was the Palestinian uprising against Israeli control that began in December 1987, the so-called intifada. He and his defense minister, Mr. Rabin, deployed thousands of Israeli troops throughout the occupied territories to quash the rebellion. They failed; the years of violence and death on both sides brought criticism and condemnation from around the world.

 The fighting also deepened divisions between Israel's two political camps: leftists who believed in making concessions to bring peace, and members of the right who believed, as Mr. Shamir once put it, that ''Israel's days without Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip are gone and will not return.''

 The intifada dragged on year after year as the death toll climbed from dozens to hundreds. Israel's isolation increased, until finally the rebellion was overshadowed in 1991 by the first Persian Gulf war.

 During that war, at the request of the United States, Prime Minister Shamir held Israel back from attacking Iraq, even as Iraqi Scud missiles fell on Tel Aviv. For that he won new favor in Washington and promises of financial aid from the United States to help with the settlement of new Israeli citizens from the Soviet Union.

 Then in the fall of 1991, under pressure from the first President George Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Mr. Shamir agreed to represent Israel at the Middle East peace conference in Madrid, Israel's first summit meeting with the Arab states. There, he was as unyielding as ever, denouncing Syria at one point as having ''the dubious honor of being one of the most oppressive, tyrannical regimes in the world.''

 Yitzhak Shamir was born on Oct. 22, 1915, in a Polish town under Russian control to Shlomo and Perla Penina Yezernitzky. He immigrated to the Palestine mandate when he was 20 and selected Shamir as his Hebrew surname. The word means thorn or sharp point.

 Members of his family who remained in Poland died in the Holocaust; his father was killed by Poles whom the family had regarded as friends. Memories of the Holocaust colored his opinions for the rest of his life.

 In the British-ruled Palestine mandate, Mr. Shamir first worked as a bookkeeper and a construction worker. But after Arabs attacked Jewish settlers and the British in 1936, he joined the Irgun Zvai Leumi, the underground Jewish defense league. In 1940, the Irgun's most militant members formed the Lehi, or Stern Gang, named for its first leader, Abraham Stern.

 After the British police killed Mr. Stern in 1942, Mr. Shamir became one of the group's top commanders. Under his leadership it began a campaign of what it called personal terror, assassinating top British military and government officers, often gunning them down in the street.

 To the Jewish public, and even to the other Jewish underground groups, Mr. Shamir's gang was ''lacking even a spark of humanity and Jewish conscience,'' Israel Rokach, the mayor of Tel Aviv, said in 1944 after Stern Gang gunmen shot three British police officers on the streets of his city.

 Years later, however, Mr. Shamir contended that it had been more humane to assassinate specific military or political figures than to attack military installations and possibly kill innocent people, as the other underground groups did. Besides, he once said, ''a man who goes forth to take the life of another whom he does not know must believe only one thing: that by his act he will change the course of history.''

 Several histories of the period have asserted that he masterminded a failed attempt to kill the British high commissioner, Sir Harold MacMichael, and the killing in Cairo of Britain's minister of state for the Middle East, Lord Moyne. When Mr. Shamir was asked about these episodes in later years, his denials held a certain evasive tone.

 It was during his time in the underground that Mr. Shamir met Shulamit Levy, who was his courier and confidante, he wrote in his autobiography, ''Summing Up.'' The couple married in 1944, meeting at a location in Jerusalem and gathering people off the street as witnesses, said their daughter, Gilada Diamant. After a hasty ceremony in deep cover, each departed immediately for a separate city.

 In addition to his daughter, Mr. Shamir is survived by a son, Yair, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. His wife died last year.

 For a brief period after World War II, the three major Jewish underground groups cooperated -- until the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem on July 22, 1946. Scores of people were killed, and Mr. Shamir was among those arrested and exiled to an internment camp in Eritrea. But he escaped a few months later and took refuge in France. He arrived in the newly independent Israel in May 1948.

 Entry Into Politics

 Mr. Shamir was a pariah of sorts to the new Labor government of Israel, which regarded him as a terrorist. Rebuffed in his efforts to work in the government, he drifted from one small job to another until 1955, when he finally found a government agency that appreciated his past: the Mossad, Israel's intelligence service. He served in several posts, including that of top agent in France, but returned to Israel and spent several years in business.

 He joined Mr. Begin's Herut Party in 1970 and was elected to Parliament in December 1973. When the Likud, or unity, bloc, which absorbed Herut, won power in 1977, Mr. Shamir was elected speaker. And when President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt visited Jerusalem in November 1977, Mr. Shamir and Israel's president, Ephraim Katzir, escorted him to the speaker's rostrum for his speech. But the next year, when the Parliament voted on the Camp David accords, which set out the terms for peace with Egypt, Mr. Shamir abstained.

 In 1979, when Moshe Dayan resigned as foreign minister, Mr. Begin proposed appointing Mr. Shamir to replace him. Yechiel Kadishai, chief of the prime minister's office under Mr. Begin, recalled that Mr. Shamir was chosen because the prime minister did not want or need a powerful figure high in his cabinet.

 ''Begin had already established himself,'' Mr. Kadishai said. ''But by 1980, he wanted no competitors for power and selected Shamir because he was not so known in political circles.''

 The liberal members of Mr. Begin's coalition objected, so Mr. Begin named himself foreign minister until 1980, when Mr. Shamir finally took the post. The Labor Party saw his appointment as an mistake, since it considered him an extremist.

 Mr. Shamir's political opponents said that his laconic nature played into his handling of the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in West Beirut in September 1982, during Israel's war in Lebanon.

 On the evening of Sept. 16, Phalangists -- Lebanese Christian militiamen -- entered the camps and began killing hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children while the Israeli Army, largely unaware of the killings, stood guard at the gates.

 The next morning in Tel Aviv, Ze'ev Schiff, a prominent Israeli journalist, received a call from a military official who told him about the slaughter. He rushed to the office of his friend Mordechai Zipori, the minister of communications, and told him what he had heard. Mr. Zipori then called the foreign minister, Mr. Shamir.

 Mr. Shamir was scheduled to meet with military and intelligence officials shortly, so with some urgency Mr. Zipori told him to ask about the report he had received that the Phalangists ''are carrying out a slaughter.''

 Mr. Zipori remembered that Mr. Shamir promised to look into the report. But according to the official findings of an Israeli government commission of inquiry, Mr. Shamir merely asked Foreign Ministry officers to see ''whether any new reports had arrived from Beirut.'' When the meeting ended, Mr. Shamir ''left for his home and took no additional action,'' the report said.

 Years later, Mr. Shamir said: ''You know, in those times of the Lebanese war, every day something happened. And from the first glance of it, it seemed like just another detail of what was going on every day. But after 24 hours, it became clear it was not a normal event.''

 Mr. Shamir was certainly not the only Israeli official who failed to act, but the commission found it ''difficult to find a justification'' for his decision not to make ''any attempt to check whether there was anything in what he heard.''

 When Mr. Begin retired in 1983, Mr. Shamir was designated his successor largely because of his position in the Foreign Ministry.

 Even many in his own party thought Mr. Shamir would lose the election. And even after he took office, many saw this low-key, colorless man as a caretaker. In some ways he was. Asked once what he intended to do in his second full term in office, he said he had no plans except to ''keep things as they are.''

 ''With our long, bitter experience,'' he added, ''we have to think twice before we do something.''","The New York Times                                July 1, 2012 Sunday                               Late Edition - Final  Yitzhak Shamir, Former Israeli Prime Minister and Militia Leader, Dies at 96"
"Gaeton Fonzi was one of the most relentless investigators on the House Select Committee on Assassinations in the late 1970s, remembered by former colleagues with both awe and echoes of the impatience he inspired with his pursuit of the full story behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.",12556,2012-09-12 00:00:00,"Gaeton Fonzi was one of the most relentless investigators on the House Select Committee on Assassinations in the late 1970s, remembered by former colleagues with both awe and echoes of the impatience he inspired with his pursuit of the full story behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

 They called him Ahab.

 Mr. Fonzi was also the staff member most publicly dismayed by the committee's final report, which concluded in 1979 that the president ''was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.''

 Of course it was a conspiracy, said Mr. Fonzi, a journalist recruited mainly on the strength of scathing magazine critiques he had written about the Warren Commission and its conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone in killing the president in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963. But who were the conspirators? What was their motive? How could the committee close its doors without the answers?

 Mr. Fonzi, who died in Florida on Aug. 30 at 76, nailed those questions to the committee's locked doors, figuratively, in a long article he wrote the next year for Washingtonian magazine and in a 1993 book, ''The Last Investigation.'' In both, he chronicled the near-blanket refusal of government intelligence agencies, especially the C.I.A., to provide the committee with documents it requested. And he accused committee leaders of folding under pressure -- from Congressional budget hawks, political advisers and the intelligence agencies themselves -- just as promising new leads were emerging.

 ''Is it unrealistic to desire, for something as important as the assassination of a president, an investigation unbound by political, financial or time restrictions?'' he asked in Washingtonian.

 He never got the answer he had hoped for. Congress never authorized a follow-up to the work of the committee, which, from 1977 to 1979, also re-examined the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., concluding that it, too, ''likely'' resulted from an unspecified conspiracy.

 But historians and researchers consider Mr. Fonzi's book among the best of the roughly 600 published on the Kennedy assassination, and credit him with raising doubts about the government's willingness to share everything it knew. The author Jefferson Morley, a former reporter for The Washington Post, said ''The Last Investigation'' had refocused attention on a handful of reported contacts between C.I.A. operatives and Oswald -- tantalizing leads that had long been fascinating to conspiracy buffs but that had never been fully scrutinized by a veteran investigative reporter.

 The Central Intelligence Agency has denied that any such contacts occurred, and Mr. Fonzi spent most of his two years with the committee crisscrossing the world trying to prove otherwise. He considered it impossible that the C.I.A. had never made contact with Oswald, a former Marine who defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, repatriated with his Russian wife and baby in 1962, and settled in Dallas, where he openly espoused Communist views.

 ''We called him Ahab, because he was so single-minded about that white whale,'' said G. Robert Blakey, the chief counsel and staff director of the House committee, now a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. The white whale for Mr. Fonzi was the meaning of those supposed contacts.

 Mr. Blakey was criticized by Mr. Fonzi as overly deferential to the C.I.A., and he now concedes that Mr. Fonzi was probably right on that score. Mr. Blakey said he was shocked in 2003 when declassified C.I.A. documents revealed the full identity of the retired agent who had acted as the committee's liaison to the C.I.A. The agency never told Mr. Blakey that the agent, George Joannides, had overseen a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Dallas in the months before the assassination, when Oswald had two well-publicized clashes with them.

 At the time of the revelation, the C.I.A. said Mr. Joannides had withheld nothing relevant from the committee. Mr. Joannides died in 1990.

 ''Mr. Joannides obstructed our investigation,'' Mr. Blakey said. Asked how that had affected the committee's work, he added: ''We'll never know. But I can say that for a guy like Gaeton, a guy who really wanted to know what happened to Kennedy, it kind of tortured him.''

 Gaetano Fonzi was born in Philadelphia on Oct. 10, 1935, to Leonora and Gaetano Fonzi, a barber. (He later shortened his first name.) After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, he was a reporter and editor at Philadelphia Magazine. In one article, he and a co-author revealed that a former star reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Harry J. Karafin, had extorted money from local businessmen with threats of unflattering coverage.

 Mr. Fonzi died of complications of Parkinson's disease at his home in Manalapan, Fla., his wife, Marie, said. He is also survived by four children, Irene, Guy and Christopher Fonzi and Maria Fonzi-Gonzalez; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

 In Florida, Mr. Fonzi worked for Miami and Gold Coast magazines, writing investigative articles. He also wrote several other books, including a biography of the media mogul and philanthropist Walter Annenberg. But the Kennedy assassination remained the story that consumed him.

"Peter Lougheed, the Alberta premier who harnessed his province's vast oil and gas resources to transform its economy, died Thursday in Calgary, Alberta.",12564,2012-09-15 00:00:00,"Peter Lougheed, the Alberta premier who harnessed his province's vast oil and gas resources to transform its economy, died Thursday in Calgary, Alberta. He was 84.

 His family attributed his death to natural causes.

 A former professional in the Canadian Football League despite his slight build, Mr. Lougheed (pronounced LAW-heed) turned Alberta into a major player in oil and gas and a pioneer in the development of oil sands after his Progressive Conservative Party took power in 1971, ending the long reign of Social Credit, a populist farm movement.

 Mr. Lougheed arrived in office at a time of great political and economic upheaval in Canada. He clashed frequently with Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the country's Liberal Party prime minister, over pivotal constitutional and economic issues.

 While Alberta's oil and gas industry was founded with the discovery of the Leduc well in 1947, Social Credit governments had neglected it, even though, as is generally the case in Canada, most of the resource was owned by the province rather than landowners.

 Mr. Lougheed raised royalties and channeled their revenues into the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, which today holds about $16 billion. As the global oil crisis struck, pushing up prices in the 1970s, the province's wealth rose with it.

 The energy crisis led to Mr. Lougheed's greatest clash with Mr. Trudeau, who tried to introduce greater federal control over energy and who sought a portion of royalty payments for the central government. After Mr. Lougheed cut oil production in Alberta, the prime minister relented, and in 1981 acknowledged that provinces had full control over their resources.

 Edgar Peter Lougheed was born in Calgary on July 26, 1928. He studied law, obtained an M.B.A. at Harvard and moved into business after his brief career in football.

 Oil sands have made Alberta the United States' largest source of imported oil today, but the projects struggled initially and were widely viewed as economically and technologically unsound. But Mr. Lougheed's government participated in a bailout of Syncrude, the industry's pioneer, in 1975. Newer oil sands projects pump the tarlike bitumen from underground rather than removing it through strip mining using technology developed through research financed by Mr. Lougheed's government.

 Mr. Lougheed is survived by his wife, Jeanne; his children, Stephen, Andrea, Pam and Joe; and seven grandchildren.

 Mr. Lougheed was a social liberal in a province that has been a bastion of social conservatism, yet he was extremely popular among Albertans.

 He left office in 1985. This summer, he was named the best Canadian premier of the last 40 years by the Institute for Research on Public Policy.

"William Miles, a self-taught filmmaker whose documentaries revealed untold stories of black America, including those of its heroic black soldiers and of life in its signature neighborhood, Harlem, where he himself grew up, died on May 12 in Queens.",47452,2013-05-24 00:00:00,"William Miles, a self-taught filmmaker whose documentaries revealed untold stories of black America, including those of its heroic black soldiers and of life in its signature neighborhood, Harlem, where he himself grew up, died on May 12 in Queens. He was 82.

 The cause was uncertain, but Mr. Miles had myriad health problems, including Parkinson's disease and dementia, said his wife of 61 years, Gloria.

 Mr. Miles was part historical sleuth, part preservationist, part bard. His films, which combined archival footage, still photographs and fresh interviews, were triumphs of curiosity and persistence in unearthing lost material about forgotten subjects.

 His first important film, ''Men of Bronze'' (1977), was about the 369th Infantry Regiment, an all-black combat unit that the Army shipped overseas during World War I but, because of segregationist policies, fought under the flag of France. Serving with great distinction, the unit spent more time in the front-line trenches than any other American unit. Collectively, it was awarded the Croix de Guerre and came to be known as the Harlem Hellfighters and also the Black Rattlers.

 The 369th began as the 15th New York National Guard Infantry Regiment, and decades later, after Mr. Miles had himself joined a National Guard unit in Harlem, he stumbled on a dusty storage room containing flags, helmets photographs and other relics from the 369th.

 He subsequently found well-preserved film footage of the regiment at the National Archives, and he tracked down living members of the unit using a technique he often employed to generate information about the past: He walked the streets of Harlem, stopping where groups of elderly residents gathered to talk and started asking questions.

 The film, which was shown on public television, depicted the black soldiers as fiercely patriotic and courageous while offering an oddly good-natured -- and moving -- critique of American racism.

 Mr. Miles's best-known work was ''I Remember Harlem,'' a four-hour historical portrait of the neighborhood that had its premiere on public television over four consecutive nights in 1981.

 ''I was walking around Harlem, where I grew up, and noticed how many of the old theaters and familiar buildings were missing,'' Mr. Miles said in an interview in The New York Times, talking about his inspiration for the film. ''I went back to my old elementary school, and on the next corner there was another man standing and looking at the building, too.''

 The man, he realized, was an old classmate.

 ''He said to me, 'I remember Harlem,' and I thought: I remember Harlem, you remember Harlem, a lot of people remember Harlem.''

 Born in Harlem on April 18, 1931, Mr. Miles grew up on West 126th Street, behind the Apollo Theater, where, as a teenager, he occasionally ran the film projector. He graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School and for a while attended City College.

 As a young man, he worked downtown as a shipping clerk for a distributor of educational films and then at Killiam Shows, a company that restored silent films; there, Mr. Miles learned mechanical skills like repairing film and clipping segments for use in commercials. During this time he met Richard Adams, who also worked at Killiam, and who became a cameraman and film editor for several of Mr. Miles's films, including ''Men of Bronze.''

 ''Bill had collaborators of all kinds,'' Mr. Adams wrote in an e-mail on Thursday, ''but only he had the vision and the persistence, and a genius for spotting archival images.''

 One of Mr. Miles's films, ''Liberators'' (1992), about black army units that helped to free Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, was partly inspired by a letter he spotted in The Times from Benjamin Bender, a Jewish survivor of Buchenwald. ''The recollections are still vivid -- '' Mr. Bender wrote of the day of liberation, April 11, 1945, ''black soldiers of the Third Army, tall and strong, crying like babies, carrying the emaciated bodies of the liberated prisoners.''

 The film, produced and directed by Mr. Miles and Nina Rosenblum, was nominated for an Academy Award, but its accuracy was subsequently questioned. Its overall point of the film -- that blacks who fought racism at home to be allowed to serve their country, then witnessed the discriminatory horrors of the Holocaust -- was not in dispute, but critics said that the film went awry in giving credit to a particular unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, part of Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army, for the liberation of Dachau and Buchenwald. (The 761st was present at the liberation of the Gunskirchen camp in Austria.) Public television stations ceased showing the film.

 In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Rosenblum said they had discovered, too late, that one of the interviewees in the film had lied about being a liberator, but she defended the film as essentially accurate, saying that Army records were inconclusive and that Mr. Miles was a scrupulous documentarian who was shattered by the controversy. ''It was the only film he ever made that had its veracity questioned,'' Ms. Rosenblum said. ''And I can tell you he tried everything to make the research complete. He was putting black history on the map in a way it hadn't been, and this was such a terrible blow. We still feel like the film, except for one guy, is valid. If the Army records are so good, tell me: Who liberated Benjamin Bender at Buchenwald?''

 Mr. Miles married the former Gloria Darlington in 1952, after having known her since they were classmates in elementary school. His other survivors include two daughters, Brenda Moore and Deborah Jones, and three grandchildren.

 Last fall, the veteran Democratic Congressman Charles B. Rangel, whose district includes Harlem, entered a testimonial to Mr. Miles in the Congressional Record. Speaking on the House floor, Mr. Rangel gave a summary of Mr. Miles's work, which includes films about black athletes, black astronauts, black cowboys, and the writer James Baldwin.

 ''Join me in a very special congressional salute to Harlem's historian and black filmmaker, William 'Bill' Miles,'' Mr. Rangel said, ''a titan of a man who has documented the history and contributions of African-Americans and the black American experience with film, camera and a lens.''

"Leonard Marsh, a former window washer who helped found Snapple, the beverage concern, and was its longtime president and chief executive, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhasset, on Long Island.",47450,2013-05-23 00:00:00,"Leonard Marsh, a former window washer who helped found Snapple, the beverage concern, and was its longtime president and chief executive, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhasset, on Long Island. He was 80.

 His son-in-law, Jack Ross, confirmed the death.

 With his brother-in-law, Hyman Golden, and a childhood friend, Arnold Greenberg, Mr. Marsh began what became the Snapple Beverage Corporation in New York City in 1972.

 The company, known early on as Unadulterated Food Products, was created to sell fruit juices to health food stores. A part-time venture, it did modestly at first.

 But the story of Snapple -- based for many years in Valley Stream, N.Y., and among the first to make a wide line of juices and other drinks from natural ingredients -- would become a latter-day Jewish Horatio Alger tale. By 1994, when it was bought by the Quaker Oats Company for $1.7 billion, Snapple was recording annual sales of about $700 million.

 Leonard Marsh was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 5, 1933, and reared in the Brownsville neighborhood there. His father was a cobbler; his mother and Mr. Greenberg's mother, he later said, pushed them in baby carriages together.

 After graduating from Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn, Mr. Marsh held various jobs, including washing windows and dealing in chickens and eggs.

 In their beverage company's early years, the three men hedged their bets: Mr. Marsh and Mr. Golden continued the window-washing business they operated together, and Mr. Greenberg kept the health food store he ran in the East Village in Manhattan.

 But by the 1980s, with consumers seeking more healthful bottled drinks, Snapple's sales had increased; with the introduction in 1987 of the first of its bottled iced teas, it solidified its position it a leader in the New Age beverage market.

 The company became known for its whimsical advertisements, notably a 1990s television campaign by Kirshenbaum & Bond featuring the Snapple Lady, a warm, earthy woman with a meaty New York accent. The character was played by Wendy Kaufman, an employee in Snapple's order department.

 After Snapple was acquired by Quaker Oats, Mr. Marsh stayed on for a few years as executive vice president for planning.

 Snapple, whose product line now includes juices, fruit punches and teas, is currently owned by the Dr Pepper Snapple Group of Plano, Tex.

 Mr. Golden died in 2008; Mr. Greenberg died last year. Besides his sister, Mildred Golden, Mr. Marsh's survivors include his wife of 57 years, the former Marian Ebner; a daughter, Robin Ross; two sons, Bradley and Peter; and eight grandchildren.

 When Mr. Marsh began Unadulterated Food Products with his colleagues, he knew chickens and he knew eggs. He also knew windows. But when it came to his start-up venture, as he told Crain's New York Business in 1989, he knew ''as much about juice as about making an atom bomb.''

 The three men did wind up making a bomb of sorts: a batch of carbonated apple juice that accidentally fermented, shooting scores of bottle caps skyward.

 But in that early cloud of failed apple juice lay a silver lining. The name the men had conceived for the product -- Snapple, a portmanteau word embodying a congenial marriage of ''snappy'' and ''apple'' -- was retained for the company as a whole.","The New York Times                               May 23, 2013 Thursday                          The New York Times on the Web  Leonard Marsh, a Founder of Snapple, Dies at 80"
"''If I were to sum up my life, everything has been about love,'' Princess Lilian of Sweden once said.",3640,2013-03-12 00:00:00,"''If I were to sum up my life, everything has been about love,'' Princess Lilian of Sweden once said.

 In what Swedes consider a Cinderella story, Lilian Craig, who died on Sunday at 97, lived for a third of a century as the lover of Sweden's Prince Bertil, unable to marry because there was a chance he could become king, and Swedish kings were forbidden to wed commoners. Pretty much the whole country knew about their relationship, but they were still barred from appearing in public together.

 Three years after King Gustaf VI died, in 1973 -- to be succeeded by his grandson Carl Gustaf -- Prince Bertil, a son of the older king, finally married Ms. Craig. He was 64 and she was 61, and both called it the happiest day of their lives. Ms. Craig became a princess and duchess with the nuptials.

 ''I was nervous as a kitten,'' Ms. Craig told The Boston Globe in 1985. ''I had butterflies in my tummy. When we exchanged vows, I was afraid I wouldn't even remember my husband's name.''

 The wedding signaled the formal end of an already bygone era. Prince Bertil had agreed to refrain from marrying a commoner because of fears it could jeopardize the royal line: he was next in line to the throne until Carl Gustaf, his nephew -- and now the king -- came of age. Today, many members of European royalty, including Sweden's, routinely and without penalty marry commoners, and female prospects have the same succession rights as male. Carl Gustaf himself married a commoner.

 Princess Lilian paid a price for her loyalty, including whispers early on about living in sin. She said she regretted not having children. ''But now the queen's children are like my children,'' she told The Globe. ''It makes up. Well, not quite.''

 As for not being allowed to be seen in public for many years, she said: ''Sometimes I felt it wasn't nice. But it was nice that we were together, anyway.''

 Her death, in Stockholm, was announced by the royal palace.

 Lillian May Davies was born in Swansea, Wales, on Aug. 30, 1915, and left school at 14 to seek work as a maid in London. She ended up working as a fashion model, dancer and singer, and marrying Ivan Craig, an actor. She dropped one of the L's from her first name, she said, because she thought it seemed more fashionable that way. During World War II, while Mr. Craig served in the British Army in Africa, Ms. Craig worked at a factory making radios for the Royal Navy and at a hospital for wounded soldiers.

 There are several versions of how she met Prince Bertil, in 1943, when he was naval attach in the Swedish Embassy: at a party held to celebrate her 28th birthday, at a nightclub, in the London subway. One story has the prince gallantly rescuing her from a drunken sailor.

 In any case, she wrote in her memoir, ''My Life With Prince Bertil'' (2000), she was captivated: ''He was so handsome, my prince. Especially in uniform. So charming and thoughtful. And so funny.''

 During their wartime separation, her husband had also developed another romantic tie. They divorced amicably.

 Two of Prince Bertil's brothers had already disqualified themselves from the line of succession by marrying commoners, becoming the first members of the Swedish royal family to do so in 400 years. Their grandfather Gustaf V, who remained king until 1950, had blocked a marriage between Prince Bertil and the daughter of a Swedish Army captain in 1934, according to The Associated Press. Prince Bertil was soon publicly linked to Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, who later became the country's queen, but that incipient relationship also fell through.

 In 1947, Prince Bertil's eldest brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf, the heir to the throne, died in a plane crash. Gustaf Adolf's son, Carl Gustaf, was less than a year old, and if the king had died before the child was old enough to assume the throne, Prince Bertil might have had to serve as a regent, or acting monarch.

 Both Prince Bertil's grandfather (who died in 1950) and father refused to allow him to marry a commoner. So he and Ms. Craig lived together in France until 1957, when they moved to Sweden to live discreetly. Her first public appearance with him was in 1972, at the 90th-birthday celebration of King Gustav VI, who had developed a personal liking for her.

 Once wed and royal, Princess Lilian, who left no immediate survivors, participated in Nobel Prize events in Stockholm. After Prince Bertil died in 1997, she helped lead sports organizations in which he had been active.

 She said laughter was the key to her longevity, and also to her great romance.

 ''Oh, how we laughed together!'' she said.","The New York Times                               March 12, 2013 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Lilian Craig, 97, Beloved Of Prince Who Could Be King"
"Otis R. Bowen, who served two terms as governor of Indiana and later became the first physician appointed as secretary of health and human services, serving under President Ronald Reagan amid the rising debate about AIDS, died on Saturday in Donaldson, Ind.",47402,2013-05-08 00:00:00,"Otis R. Bowen, who served two terms as governor of Indiana and later became the first physician appointed as secretary of health and human services, serving under President Ronald Reagan amid the rising debate about AIDS, died on Saturday in Donaldson, Ind. He was 95.

 His death was announced by Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana.

 Dr. Bowen worked as a family practitioner in Bremen, Ind. (population 3,500 at the time), for a quarter-century beginning in the late 1940s, and he was known to occasionally pull out a pad and write prescriptions for colleagues' minor ailments when he served in the Indiana legislature in the 1960s.

 He brought a calm bedside manner and an independent streak when he arrived in Washington in 1985, joining the administration during Reagan's second term. At the time, criticism was rising that the administration was not doing enough to respond to AIDS. Dr. Bowen did not become as prominent an advocate for AIDS issues and education as Dr. C. Everett Koop, the surgeon general who served under Reagan and who died in February, but he offered explicit warnings about the disease's threat, including its risk to heterosexuals.

 In 1987, Dr. Bowen warned that deadly health disasters like the Black Death, smallpox and typhoid could seem ''pale by comparison'' with AIDS if more was not done.

 In 1988, after new studies showed the spread of the disease slowing among many groups, he shifted quickly, saying, ''We do not expect any explosion into the heterosexual population.''

 Dr. Bowen successfully lobbied Congress to approve a bill that would extend Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses -- an issue that he had been interested in since serving on a Social Security advisory board in 1983. The law, drafted with the assistance of his chief of staff, Thomas R. Burke, was passed amid praise for its bipartisan support. But after Medicare beneficiaries complained that it had made their premiums rise -- some conservatives called the measure socialistic -- the law was repealed in 1989.

 Otis Ray Bowen was born on Feb. 26, 1918, in Richland Center, Ind. The son of a schoolteacher, he received his bachelor's degree from Indiana University and his medical degree from Indiana University Medical School in 1942. He served in the Army Medical Corps during World War II.

 He won his first election in 1952, when he ran for coroner in Marshall County. He was elected to the legislature four years later and became speaker in 1967. He served in that role for four sessions, longer than any of his predecessors.

 He lost a bid for governor in 1968. He was the first governor of Indiana to serve for two terms in more than a century, and he helped draft a major revision of state tax policy that reduced reliance on property taxes and increased revenue from sales taxes.

 Dr. Bowen had returned to practicing medicine and was teaching at Indiana University Medical School when President Reagan appointed him at the urging of Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana.

 Dr. Bowen is survived by his wife, the former Carol Hahn; a daughter, Judy McGrew; three sons, Rick, Tim and Rob; a stepson, Vance; a stepdaughter, Mindy; 12 grandchildren; 4 step-grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.

 His first wife, Elizabeth Anne Steinmann, died in 1981. His second wife, the former Rose May Hochstetler, died in 1991.","The New York Times                               May 8, 2013 Wednesday                          The New York Times on the Web  Otis R.

"Edgar M. Bronfman, the billionaire businessman and philanthropist who as chairman of the Seagram Company expanded his family's liquor-based empire and who as president of the World Jewish Congress championed the rights of Jews everywhere, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan.",5962,2013-12-23 00:00:00,"Edgar M. Bronfman, the billionaire businessman and philanthropist who as chairman of the Seagram Company expanded his family's liquor-based empire and who as president of the World Jewish Congress championed the rights of Jews everywhere, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 84.

 His death, of natural causes, was confirmed by the family's Samuel Bronfman Foundation.

 Mr. Bronfman inherited control of Seagram from his father, Samuel Bronfman, an irascible, self-made Canadian magnate who founded a distilling company in 1924 and got rich during Prohibition when Bronfman liquor found its way to American customers through bootleggers.

 Edgar gave the company a more sophisticated image, in keeping with his own elegantly turned-out profile in New York society -- a prominence underscored in the 1970s by the headlines generated by the kidnapping of his son Sam for ransom money.

 But as liquor profits began to falter, he broadened the company by acquiring Tropicana, taking Seagram into the oil business and eventually making it the largest minority shareholder in DuPont, the chemical giant. Later, he allowed his son Edgar Jr., who had succeeded him as head of the company, to risk billions of dollars to transform Seagram once again, this time into a major player in Hollywood.

 As president of the World Jewish Congress, from 1981 until 2007, Mr. Bronfman turned a loose, cautious federation of Jewish groups in 66 countries into a more focused, confrontational organization.

 Under his leadership, the Congress pressed the Soviet Union to improve conditions for Jews living within its borders and to allow freer emigration. Spurred by Mr. Bronfman, the Congress led efforts to expose the hidden Nazi past of Kurt Waldheim, the former secretary general of the United Nations who became president of Austria. And it campaigned successfully to force Swiss banks to make restitutions of more than a billion dollars to the relatives of German death camp victims who deposited their savings in Switzerland before World War II.

 Mr. Bronfman shrugged off criticism from those who feared that his aggressive tactics were risking an anti-Semitic backlash. ''The answer isn't to say, 'Don't make trouble,' and hide our heads in the sand,'' he wrote in his 1998 memoir, ''Good Spirits: The Making of a Businessman.'' ''We may not earn the friendship of others, but we will demand their respect.''

 Prospering by Prohibition

 Edgar Miles Bronfman was born in Montreal on June 20, 1929. His father and his mother, the former Saidye Rosner, were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who had moved to Montreal from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Edgar was the third-born of their four children.

 Sam Bronfman and his brother Allan established a successful mail-order liquor company but were forced to give it up when provincial governments in Canada took over the retail side of the liquor business themselves. The Bronfmans decided that if they could not sell liquor, they would produce it. The family built its own distillery near Montreal in 1925.

 It prospered, and the Bronfmans took advantage of Prohibition by opening more distilleries just across the border from the United States. One that the brothers bought was owned by the Seagram family, and they incorporated the name. When Prohibition ended, they were strategically placed to open a Seagram subsidiary in the United States, in 1933.

 ''How much business Father and his brothers did with bootleggers was never clear,'' Mr. Bronfman wrote in ''Good Spirits.''

 Edgar and his siblings grew up in aristocratic splendor. Their family's suburban Montreal mansion was staffed with a butler, a cook, maids, nannies, gardeners and chauffeurs. They spent summers at their country estate in Tarrytown, N.Y., and at the family retreat on Lake Placid in the Adirondacks.

 But affluence did not always evoke fond memories. ''My childhood was marked by a tension between privilege on the one hand and emotional dysfunction on the other,'' Mr. Bronfman wrote in ''Good Spirits.'' He complained that his father had rarely been around and that his mother had been remote and inaccessible.

 Mr. Bronfman said he had grown up with a confused understanding of his Jewish identity. The Bronfmans kept a kosher home, and the children received religious schooling on weekends. But during the week Edgar and his younger brother, Charles, were among a handful of Jews sent to private Anglophile schools, where they attended chapel and ate pork. ''No one said anything to my face,'' Mr. Bronfman remembered, ''but I constantly heard comments denigrating Jews.''

 Mr. Bronfman enrolled at Williams College in Massachusetts and then transferred to McGill University in Montreal, graduating in 1951.

 At 21 he joined Seagram, working as an apprentice taster and accounting clerk in Montreal and then at the main distillery nearby, where he eventually oversaw production. He had a knack for finances and the boldness to tell his tyrannical father how best to handle his money. At 22 he explained that Seagram could reap great tax benefits if it incorporated its petroleum subsidiary and carried out exploration in the United States rather than in Canada.

 ''Fortunately, Father saw the point at once and agreed,'' he wrote.

 Mr. Bronfman was a confident executive, safe in the knowledge that as the firstborn son he was the heir apparent. His brother accepted his status and throughout his life deferred to Mr. Bronfman on business decisions. But his oldest sibling, Minda, resented the accident of gender that had removed her from consideration as the eventual heir, despite her degree in business administration. Relations between her and Edgar were strained for most of their lives.

 In 1953 Mr. Bronfman married Ann Loeb, a granddaughter of the financier Carl M. Loeb. Loeb, Rhoades & Company helped the Bronfmans purchase the Texas Pacific Coal and Oil Company.

 Building an American Empire

 Mr. Bronfman convinced his father that since the United States accounted for 90 percent of Seagram revenues, it made sense to install himself permanently in New York. In 1953 Samuel Bronfman put Edgar in control of the company's subsidiary in the United States, Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, and placed Charles in charge of the Canadian branch, the House of Seagram.

 Mr. Bronfman moved to New York two years later and shortly afterward became an American citizen -- although it was his sister Phyllis, who had studied architecture, who was put in charge of the construction of the new company headquarters, the Seagram Building, on Park Avenue, designed by Mies van der Rohe and considered a jewel of modern skyscraper design. At its zenith, in 1956, Seagram products accounted for one of every three distilled-alcohol drinks in the United States. Then its market share began to slide. To compensate for the losses, Mr. Bronfman squeezed more profits from less production, using modern cost-cutting methods and focusing on more expensive brands of whiskey.

 But he was frustrated by his inability to wrest full control of Seagram from his aging father, and he began to dabble in film and television production. After losing a bid for MGM to the financier Kirk Kerkorian, however, he returned full time to the beverage business.

 With the death of his father in 1971, Mr. Bronfman's personal life began to unravel. That same year he separated from his wife, with whom he had five children. After their divorce, he married Lady Carolyn Townshend, in 1973, but that marriage also ended in divorce, a year later. He quickly became involved with another Englishwoman, Rita Webb (who changed her name to Georgiana). They married and divorced each other twice, and had two daughters. He then married Jan Aronson, an artist and a former triathlete.

 He is survived by Ms. Aronson; his sons, Samuel, Edgar Jr., Matthew and Adam, and his daughter Holly Bronfman Lev, all from his first marriage; his daughters with Ms. Webb, Sara Igtet and Clare Bronfman; his brother, Charles; his sister Phyllis Lambert; 24 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

 In 1975, Samuel Bronfman II was kidnapped in New York and held for ransom. Mr. Bronfman himself delivered the $2.4 million ransom to one of his son's two kidnappers, who were both arrested shortly afterward by the F.B.I. But the kidnappers' lawyer claimed in court that the abduction had been a hoax and that Sam Bronfman had been a part of it. In the end, the jury convicted the defendants of the lesser charge of extortion. With liquor consumption in decline in 1981, Mr. Bronfman tried to buy Conoco, a major oil and gas company. Seagram lost out to DuPont in the bidding but, because of its investment in Conoco, ended up with a 20 percent share of DuPont -- and soon raised this to almost 25 percent, making Seagram DuPont's largest minority shareholder.

 Initially, most Wall Street analysts and the financial press took the position that Seagram had been outdueled for Conoco by DuPont. A 1981 Business Week article quoted a DuPont senior executive as saying jokingly that he enjoyed drinking ''Seagram on the rocks.'' But by 1985 its stake in DuPont accounted for nearly 75 percent of Seagram's earnings, and Mr. Bronfman was being hailed as a smart, risk-taking businessman.

 At the same time, Mr. Bronfman was becoming increasingly involved in Jewish causes. He was elected president of the World Jewish Congress in 1981. ''Making money is marvelous, and I love doing it, and I do it reasonably well,'' he told The New York Times in 1986, ''but it doesn't have the gripping vitality that you have when you deal with the happiness of human life and with human deprivation.''

 As his devotion to Jewish causes grew, he reduced his involvement with Seagram and prepared to turn over the company to the next generation. By family tradition his oldest son, Sam, was the logical successor, but he favored his second son, Edgar Jr., and without consulting either, Mr. Bronfman announced his choice in a 1986 interview with Fortune magazine. It would be Edgar Jr.

 ''It took Sam a long time to get over the hurt that I had inflicted,'' Mr. Bronfman later conceded. ''But my responsibility was to choose the right C.E.O. for Seagram regardless of presumed birthright or familial relationship.''

 Edgar Bronfman Jr. became president of Seagram in 1989 and chief executive in 1994. With his father's approval, he sold Seagram's shares in DuPont and used the proceeds, more than $9 billion, to purchase MCA, a major Hollywood film and music company, which was later split into Universal Studios and Universal Music.

 DuPont's share price doubled within four years, while Seagram's stock barely budged during the long bull market of the 1990s. Undeterred, Edgar Jr. spent billions more on entertainment.

 In 1998 he bought PolyGram, the giant music company, but the resulting conglomerate floundered, forcing him to seek a strategic partner. So in 2000 he negotiated yet another controversial deal, an all-stock acquisition of the French conglomerate Vivendi. He briefly became chief executive of the new company, Vivendi Universal, but after Seagram lost control of its entertainment holdings, he stepped down from an executive capacity in 2001. Seagram then sold its beverage business. In 2004, Edgar Jr. acquired Warner Music Group.

 A Voice for Jews

 Edgar Sr., for his part, became a major philanthropist through the family foundation, with a focus on Jewish educational and social programs in the United States and Israel. At New York University, he helped establish the Edgar M. Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life. In 1999, President Bill Clinton presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Mr. Bronfman also wrote four autobiographical books.

 His work with the World Jewish Congress also accelerated. In the 1990s the congress, spurred by Mr. Bronfman, negotiated with Eastern European countries to recover -- or at least receive compensation for -- the property of Jews that had been seized first by the Nazis and then by the Communists.

 In the late '90s, the congress became one of the foremost critics of Switzerland's role during World War II, accusing Swiss banks of having stolen the deposits of European Jews who died during the war. After several years of bitter negotiations, Swiss banks agreed in 1999 to distribute at least $1.25 billion in compensation to relatives of European Jews who had secretly deposited their money in Switzerland before perishing at the Nazis' hands.

 Mr. Bronfman acknowledged that he could be abrasive in pursuing Jewish causes, but he defended his approach, telling The Times in 1986, ''I would like every Jew to be as comfortable in his skin as I am in mine.''","The New York Times                              December 23, 2013 Monday                               Late Edition - Final  Edgar M.

"Johnnie M. Walters, a commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service under President Richard M. Nixon who left office after refusing to prosecute people on Nixon's notorious ''enemies list,'' died on Tuesday at his home in Greenville, S.C.",10055,2014-06-26 00:00:00,"Johnnie M. Walters, a commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service under President Richard M. Nixon who left office after refusing to prosecute people on Nixon's notorious ''enemies list,'' died on Tuesday at his home in Greenville, S.C. He was 94.

 His son Hilton confirmed the death.

 Nixon had fired his first I.R.S. commissioner, Randolph W. Thrower, for resisting White House pressure to punish political opponents. Mr. Thrower, who served from 1969 to 1971, died at 100 in March.

 Mr. Walters represented the Middle American values Nixon trumpeted. As a sharecropper's son, he followed a mule with a plow as a boy and went on to be an assistant scoutmaster, lead a Rotary Club and preach as a layman in a Baptist church. Before coming to Washington, his only political activity was as treasurer of the Republican Party in Greenville.

 At the time of Mr. Thrower's firing, Mr. Walters was assistant attorney general for tax policy. Attorney General John Mitchell recommended him for the I.R.S. job, and he had strong backing from Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, a friend. The New York Times suggested in a profile that he was appointed partly because ''he would not be overly independent in exercising his powerful office.''

 His stated goals were simplifying the tax process and catching tax cheats. His agency's job had grown more complex when it was given the added responsibility of enforcing the wage-price guidelines Nixon imposed to stem inflation.

 Mr. Walters had not been told of Nixon's other job requirements, as revealed in a White House conversation recorded on May 13, 1971. ''I want to be sure he is a ruthless son of a bitch, that he will do what he's told, that every income-tax return I want to see I see, that he will go after our enemies and not go after our friends,'' the president said.

 Mr. Walters failed to follow this script -- which was unknown to him -- when John W. Dean III, the White House counsel, summoned him to his office on Sept. 11, 1972. Mr. Dean handed him the ''enemies list'' of 200 people, most prominent Democrats, whom he wanted investigated.

 ''I was shocked,'' Mr. Walters said in a 1997 interview with The Washington Post. ''John, do you realize what you're doing?'' he remembered saying. ''If I did what you asked, it'd make Watergate look like a Sunday school picnic.''

 But Mr. Dean was emphatic, he recalled, saying, ''The man I work for doesn't like somebody to say 'no.' ''

 Several days later, Mr. Walters went to his immediate boss, Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz, showed him the list and recommended that the I.R.S. do nothing. Mr. Shultz told him to lock the list in his safe.

 By Sept. 15, Nixon had been told of Mr. Walters's reluctance to follow instructions. ''Why the hell did we promote him?'' H. R. Haldeman, the White House chief of staff said, according to a tape.

 Nixon told Mr. Dean, ''You've got to kick Walters's ass out first and get a man in there.'' The president added that Mr. Shultz needed to make sure that Mr. Walters left if he wanted to keep his own job.

 Mr. Walters gave the list to Laurence N. Woodworth, chief of staff of Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. He wrote in his 2011 book, ''Our Journey,'' that this was the most important thing he did, ''because then we could say with absolute certainty that I.R.S. never began any audit or investigation of any name on that list because of the list.''

 Mr. Walters testified to various committees investigating alleged Nixon misdeeds. He left office in April 1973.

 Johnnie McKeiver Walters was born on Dec. 20, 1919, near Hartsville, S.C., a small farm town. He graduated from Furman University in Greenville in 1943 and joined the Army Air Forces, serving as a navigator on more than 50 combat missions in Europe and winning the Purple Heart and other medals. He graduated from the University of Michigan Law School, where he met Donna Hall, whom he married in 1947.

 In addition to his wife and his son Hilton, he is survived by another son, John Roy; his daughters, Donna Diane Gent and Betsy Kukorowski; his sisters, Mildred Purvis, Louise Sparrow and Christine King; five grandchildren; and one great-grandson.

 After law school, Mr. Walters worked briefly for the I.R.S., then joined the tax department of Texaco in New York. In 1961, he returned to Greenville and hung up his shingle as a tax lawyer.

 He was appointed an assistant attorney general in 1969. His strong advocacy of preserving tax-exempt status for all-white private schools was his most visible activity there. The status was ended anyway.

 Mr. Walters's moralistic streak was evident in his disdain for tax evaders.

 ''It is indeed strange that the theft of a used car worth $500 rates a three-year prison sentence, whereas the theft of $50,000 of taxes rates only a small fine and no prison time,'' he said in a 1972 speech. ''Yes, theft; what else is tax evasion?''","The New York Times                               June 26, 2014 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Johnnie M.

"Richard Mellon Scaife, the Pittsburgh philanthropist and reclusive heir to the Mellon banking fortune, whose support for right-wing causes laid the foundations for America's modern conservative movement and fueled the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, died on Friday at his home in Pittsburgh.",10089,2014-07-05 00:00:00,"Richard Mellon Scaife, the Pittsburgh philanthropist and reclusive heir to the Mellon banking fortune, whose support for right-wing causes laid the foundations for America's modern conservative movement and fueled the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, died on Friday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 82.

 His death was confirmed by his lawyer, H. Yale Gutnick. Mr. Scaife had announced recently in a front-page article in The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, a newspaper he owned, that he had an untreatable form of cancer.

 Decades before David H. and Charles G. Koch bankrolled right-wing causes, Mr. Scaife and Joseph Coors, the beer magnate, were the leading financiers of the conservative crusade of the 1970s and '80s, seeking to reverse the liberal traditions of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society.

 Mr. Scaife (pronounced SKAYF) inherited roughly $500 million in 1965, and with more family bequests and income from trust funds and investments in oil, steel and real estate, he nearly tripled his net worth over his lifetime. But unlike his forebears, who were primarily benefactors of museums, public art collections, education and medicine, he gave hundreds of millions of dollars to promote conservative political causes.

 He never ran for public office or gave speeches to promote his political views. Indeed, he was notoriously withdrawn, rarely giving interviews or addressing controversies that regularly engulfed him. He had a longstanding drinking problem, engaged in bitter feuds with relatives, friends and employees, and found his troubled life examined in the news media, despite phalanxes of lawyers, spokesmen and retainers paid to insulate him from endless public fascination with his wealth and power.

 But in written answers to questions by The Washington Post in 1999, he said concerns for America motivated him. ''I am not a politician, although like most Americans I have some political views,'' he said. ''Basically I am a private individual who has concerns about his country and who has resources that give me the privilege -- and responsibility -- to do something to help my country if I can.''

 He had the caricatured look of a jovial billionaire promoting ''family values'' in America: a real-life Citizen Kane with red cheeks, white hair, blue eyes and a wide smile for the cameras. Friends called him intuitive but not intellectual. He told Vanity Fair his favorite TV show was ''The Simpsons,'' and his favorite book was John O'Hara's ''Appointment in Samarra,'' about a rich young Pennsylvanian bent on self-destruction.

 In his first foray into national politics, in 1964, Mr. Scaife backed Senator Barry M. Goldwater, the Arizona Republican, who lost his presidential bid in a landslide. In 1972, Mr. Scaife gave $1 million to the re-election war chest of President Richard M. Nixon, including $45,000 to a secret fund linked to the Watergate scandal. And in the 1980s, Mr. Scaife ardently supported Ronald Reagan's presidency.

 But, disillusioned by Watergate and Nixon, he switched his focus from officeholders to ideologies, and his influence in the rise of neoconservatism stemmed primarily from his contributions to think tanks, lobbyists and publications that promoted free-market economics, lower taxes, smaller government and cuts in social welfare programs. Beneficiaries included the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute and Judicial Watch.

 In another approach, in the 1990s, he poured millions into what critics called a moral crusade against Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, financing investigations by publications, notably the conservative American Spectator and his own Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, that were aimed at discrediting the Clintons.

 They accused the Clintons of fraud in the Whitewater case, a failed real estate venture in the 1970s and '80s, when Mr. Clinton was governor of Arkansas, and Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct in liaisons with Paula Jones in Little Rock and Monica Lewinsky in the White House. They also charged that Vincent W. Foster Jr., a White House counsel and former law partner of Mrs. Clinton, had been murdered in 1993 in a Whitewater cover-up. Several investigations found that Mr. Foster had committed suicide.

 The accusations, which prompted Mrs. Clinton to say on national television that her husband was the target of a ''vast right-wing conspiracy,'' troubled the administration for most of its tenure. They led to the convictions of 15 people in criminal cases, the appointment of a special prosecutor and the president's impeachment by the House on perjury and obstruction of justice charges and his acquittal by the Senate, both by largely partisan votes.

 During the Whitewater hearings in 1998, it was disclosed that the special prosecutor, Kenneth W. Starr, had accepted a job as dean of the public policy school at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif. He reversed his decision after the Justice Department said it might be a conflict of interest because Mr. Scaife was a Pepperdine regent and a major donor to the university and its public policy chairman.

 Mr. Scaife gave millions to what he called nonpolitical campus, community and church organizations that promoted conservative causes; public interest law firms; and consumer and environmental groups that actually promoted business interests. Critics say liberal groups have long acted with similar deceptions. He also gave to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Carnegie Institute, the National Gallery of Art, other museums, hospitals, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Planned Parenthood.

 In 2008, Mrs. Clinton, then a Democratic senator from New York running for president, met Mr. Scaife and editors and reporters of The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review for an interview. The newspaper endorsed her, and Mr. Scaife, in a commentary, said: ''I have a very different impression of Hillary Clinton today. And it's a very favorable one indeed.''

 Richard Mellon Scaife was born in Pittsburgh on July 3, 1932, one of two children of Alan Magee Scaife and Sarah Cordelia Mellon Scaife. His father was the scion of a Pittsburgh steel family, and his mother was the daughter of Richard B. Mellon, who made fortunes in banking and oil, and a niece of Andrew W. Mellon, the Treasury secretary in the Harding, Coolidge and Hoover administrations.

 Richard, known as Dickie, and his sister, Cordelia, grew up on the family estate, Penguin Court, in Ligonier, Pa. He suffered a fractured skull in a horse-riding accident when he was 9, and spent a year in bed, mostly reading newspapers. Congressmen and senators were frequent guests in his home, and he developed an early interest in politics.

 He graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts. But at Yale he was suspended for drunken pranks, then expelled in his first year. He later attended the University of Pittsburgh, where his father was chairman of the trustees, and in 1957 graduated with a degree in English.

 In 1956, he married Frances L. Gilmore. They had two children, Jennie and David, and were divorced in 1991. Later that year, he married his longtime companion, Margaret Ritchie Battle. They were separated in 2005 under a settlement that awarded her $725,000 a month from her husband's fortune, then estimated at $1.4 billion. They divorced in 2012.

 Survivors include his daughter and son and two grandchildren.

 After his father died in 1958, Mr. Scaife took his seats on corporate boards, but was given little to do in the family business, which was controlled by his uncle, R. K. Mellon. His mother, who backed medical and environmental causes, family planning and charities for the poor and disabled, encouraged his interest in philanthropy. He distributed money through the Sarah Scaife, Carthage and Allegheny Foundations.

 In the 1970s, Mr. Scaife bought several newspapers, including The Tribune-Review in Greensburg, Pa., southeast of Pittsburgh. He spent lavishly to turn it into a metropolitan newspaper marketed as The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette remained the city's dominant newspaper, but Mr. Scaife cared primarily about winning readers over to his conservative views.","The New York Times                               July 5, 2014 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Richard M.

"Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., who was the son of two prominent members of Congress and yet, as a pioneer of the capital's lobbying and fund-raising industry, was the one who came to be called ''King of the Hill,'' died on Monday at his home in Chevy Chase, Md.",10314,2014-09-16 00:00:00,"WASHINGTON -- Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., who was the son of two prominent members of Congress and yet, as a pioneer of the capital's lobbying and fund-raising industry, was the one who came to be called ''King of the Hill,'' died on Monday at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He would have been 74 on Thursday.

 His sister, the broadcast journalist Cokie Roberts, said he had apparently had a heart attack.

 After one unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 1970, for a seat from Maryland rather than Louisiana, his family's stronghold, Mr. Boggs chose to follow what the Boggses called the family business, politics, in a more lucrative way. Losing the race, he later told an interviewer, was ''the best thing that ever happened to me.''

 Starting a small company with a partner, Jim Patton, Mr. Boggs used his familiarity with both the levers of power and the intricacies of policy to build the firm Patton Boggs into a giant that became synonymous with Washington lobbying and represented some of the nation's largest corporations and trade associations.

 Mr. Boggs had a notable success as a behind-the-scenes architect of the federal government's 1979 bailout of Chrysler, his client. He was well known for battling on behalf of trial lawyers to block changes to tort law that threatened to make it harder for people to sue for damages, and for lobbying for free trade, a priority of his father's, in Congress. Like some of its competitors in the lobbying industry, Patton Boggs went through tough times in recent years. It merged this year with the international law firm Squire Sanders to become Squire Patton Boggs.

 Despite the often-criticized nature of his work, Mr. Boggs -- known as Tommy to presidents, friends and reporters, although he preferred Tom -- received generally friendly treatment in the news media. In 1999, ''60 Minutes'' broadcast a segment, titled ''The Lobbyist,'' that called him ''the fattest of the fat cats'' -- a sobriquet Ms. Roberts had threatened to preserve in needlepoint. The year before, Carl Bernstein profiled him in Vanity Fair magazine under the title ''King of the Hill.''

 Mr. Boggs, reflecting his political heritage, was an active Democrat and raised large sums for party candidates. But he operated mainly before partisanship in Congress turned toxic, in a time when Democrats and Republicans were amiable adversaries, working and socializing together.

 A few Republican friends, like Haley Barbour, a fellow lobbyist and former Mississippi governor, received Mr. Boggs's contributions as well. And Ms. Roberts said her brother would never aid anyone who tried to unseat a longtime Republican senator, Charles M. ''Mac'' Mathias Jr., because Mr. Mathias had been so kind to the Boggs family after their father died.

 In 1972, as the younger Mr. Boggs was establishing his firm, his father was the House majority leader and expected to rise to speaker. But weeks before the November elections, the elder Mr. Boggs was campaigning in Alaska for a local congressman, Nick Begich, when their plane disappeared. (Mr. Begich's son Mark is now a senator from Alaska.)

 ''Tommy often talked about how hard that was, because he had sort of just gotten to know him as a friend,'' Ms. Roberts said.

 Months after his father's plane was lost, his mother, Lindy Boggs, was elected to finish her husband's term and was then re-elected repeatedly, rising to the senior ranks of the House. She retired in 1991, served from 1997 to 2001 as President Bill Clinton's ambassador to the Vatican and died last year at 97.

 Mr. Boggs was born in New Orleans on Sept. 18, 1940, the second of four children and the only surviving son of Thomas Hale Boggs Sr. and the former Marie Corinne Morrison Claiborne (Lindy was a nickname). Mr. Boggs Jr., who was born the year that the senior Mr. Boggs was first elected to Congress, bore a rough resemblance to his craggily handsome father.

 Although the family was closely identified with New Orleans, Mr. Boggs was raised in the Washington area, in a house where his parents hosted Democrats with names like Kennedy, Humphrey and Rayburn.

 Mr. Boggs attended local Roman Catholic schools, from a parish elementary school in Bethesda, Md., through Georgetown Prep, Georgetown University and finally Georgetown Law School. In high school, he once had a job operating a Capitol elevator for lawmakers.

 His older sister, Barbara Boggs Sigmund, who was mayor of Princeton, N.J., died in 1990. Mr. Boggs is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Barbara Boggs; three children, T. Hale Boggs III, Elizabeth Boggs Davidsen and Douglas Boggs; and eight grandchildren.

 ''He was an incredibly generous person,'' Ms. Roberts said. ''People come up to me all the time and say, 'Your brother got me through a really hard patch.' '' But, she added, ''The reason he was so successful was because he worked incredibly hard. He knew every detail of every piece of legislation that he worked on and every player, and not just the out-front players.''","The New York Times                             September 16, 2014 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., 73, Lobbying Giant, Is Dead"
"Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the founding drummer and last surviving original member of the Ramones, the New York City band whose dizzying, short blasts of melody codified the sound of punk rock, died on Friday at his home in Ridgewood, Queens.",10112,2014-07-13 00:00:00,"Tom Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the founding drummer and last surviving original member of the Ramones, the New York City band whose dizzying, short blasts of melody codified the sound of punk rock, died on Friday at his home in Ridgewood, Queens. He was 65.

 The cause was cancer of the bile duct, his family said. Of the original Ramones, Joey (the singer) died in 2001, Dee Dee (the bassist) in 2002 and Johnny (the guitarist) in 2004.

 Mr. Erdelyi played only on the band's first three albums, ''Ramones'' in 1976 and ''Leave Home'' and ''Rocket to Russia,'' both from 1977. And he cut a much more easygoing figure than his bandmates, who despite their fraternal stage names were notorious for internecine feuds. Yet Mr. Erdelyi played a crucial role in the sound and early development of the band, which was started by the high school friends from Forest Hills, Queens.

 When the group first came together in 1974, Mr. Erdelyi, who had some experience in the music business as a recording engineer, was the manager. Equally in love with hard rock's buzz-saw guitar and the sunny clarity of 1950s and '60s radio pop, the four men, dressed in leather jackets and ripped jeans like B-movie juvenile delinquents, opposed the mellow singer-songwriters and opulent progressive rock that dominated pop at the time.

 In the band's earliest incarnation, Joey -- real name Jeffrey Hyman -- was the drummer. But once it was discovered that Joey had the most capable singing voice, he moved to lead vocals.

 ''We started auditioning drummers, but they just couldn't grasp the concept of the band -- the speed and simplicity,'' Mr. Erdelyi said in a 2011 interview with the website Noisecreep. ''So I'd sit down and show them what we were looking for and the guys just finally said, 'Why don't you do it?' So I gave it a try and that's when the sound of the band sort of solidified.''

 In songs like ''Beat on the Brat'' and ''Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue,'' the nascent Ramones compressed nursery-rhyme chords into adrenalized blares, and seemed to satirize the very ideas of teenage boredom and cheap kicks. Playing regularly at the East Village bar CBGB, the band charged through the set, pausing long enough between songs only for Dee Dee to shout, ''One, two, three, four!''

 Official songwriting credits were shared by the full band. But Mr. Erdelyi was the primary author of several of the Ramones' early classics, including ''Blitzkrieg Bop,'' which opens their first album with the chant ''Hey ho, let's go!'' and features lyrics that boil teenage angst down to its most basic and kinetic:

 What they want, I don't know

 They're all revved up and ready to go

 He was born Erdelyi Tamas on Jan. 29, 1949, in Budapest. His parents were professional photographers. Most of the rest of his family died in the Holocaust, he recalled in Steven Lee Beeber's 2006 book, ''The Heebie-Jeebies at CBGB's: A Secret History of Jewish Punk.''

 He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1957 and changed his name to Thomas Erdelyi. In high school, he played guitar in a garage band called Tangerine Puppets with a schoolmate, John Cummings -- the future Johnny Ramone.

 Later Mr. Erdelyi trained as a recording engineer and worked at the Record Plant studio in Manhattan. He was associate producer of the Ramones' first album, which was produced by Craig Leon, and he was a co-producer of the band's next three records. Mr. Erdelyi left the band after ''Rocket to Russia,'' released in 1977, to concentrate on producing. He was replaced on the drums by Marc Bell, who took on the name Marky Ramone.

 Mr. Erdelyi produced the Replacements' ''Tim'' in 1985 and Redd Kross' ''Neurotica'' in 1987. With Ed Stasium, he also produced the Ramones' 1979 live album, ''It's Alive'' -- recorded in 1977 when Mr. Erdelyi was still with the band -- and ''Too Tough to Die'' in 1984.

 In the 2000s Mr. Erdelyi and his longtime companion, Claudia Tienan, performed bluegrass-style music as the duo Uncle Monk, releasing a self-titled album on their own label, Airday. Ms. Tienan survives him, as does a brother, Peter.

 The Ramones, who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, were a quintessential rock group whose influence far exceeded record sales.

 The group's self-titled debut, which Rolling Stone magazine has ranked the 33rd greatest album of all time, peaked at No. 111 on Billboard's album chart. In April, 38 years after its release, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, recognizing that it had finally sold at least 500,000 copies.","The New York Times                                July 13, 2014 Sunday                               Late Edition - Final  Tommy Ramone, 65, Dies; Gave Punk Rock Its Pulse"
"Martin R. Hoffmann, a former secretary of the Army who in the 1970s presided during a cheating scandal at West Point and helped usher in the all-volunteer Army, died on July 14 at a hospital in Warrenton, Va.",10160,2014-07-27 00:00:00,"Martin R. Hoffmann, a former secretary of the Army who in the 1970s presided during a cheating scandal at West Point and helped usher in the all-volunteer Army, died on July 14 at a hospital in Warrenton, Va. He was 82.

 His death was caused by cancer, his wife, Margaret, said. Mr. Hoffmann lived in Washington.

 Before becoming Army secretary, Mr. Hoffmann was a soldier, a congressional aide and a close adviser to James R. Schlesinger when Mr. Schlesinger headed the Atomic Energy Commission and the Defense Department -- so close that The New York Times referred to him as Mr. Schlesinger's ''alter ego and troubleshooter.''

 President Gerald R. Ford appointed Mr. Hoffmann Army secretary in 1975 to succeed Howard H. Callaway, who had resigned to manage Ford's 1976 presidential campaign. The secretary functions as the Army's civilian chief executive, with the uniformed chief of staff serving directly under him.

 Mr. Hoffmann's stiffest challenge was the cheating scandal at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., in 1976. More than 220 cadets were implicated in a scheme to share answers on an electrical engineering take-home test, and 152 were expelled -- the sole penalty at the time for violating the academy's honor code. The scandal caused intense discussion about every aspect of the code.

 Some said the honor system had long been arbitrarily administered, affording cadets almost none of the legal process guaranteed in civilian or military courts. Others said that with expulsion as the only penalty for lying, cheating or stealing, cadets were reluctant to report wrongdoing. The academy itself was criticized for intruding on honor code decisions that were supposed to be left to a committee of cadets.

 In August 1976, Mr. Hoffmann appeared before a House Armed Services subcommittee. While condemning cheating, he pledged a ''broad-based, sensitive, nonintrusive look'' into the honor system. He said the institution bore ''part of the blame'' because of uneven, imprecisely defined enforcement, and he named Frank Borman, the former astronaut and West Point graduate, to head an investigative panel.

 Mr. Borman's essential recommendation was to get the matter over with by reinstating the cadets who had cheated as soon as possible. Mr. Hoffmann agreed but demanded that the cadets not come back for a year, which he hoped they would spend as soldiers. Nearly 100 cadets were ultimately readmitted.

 The honor system continues to be run by cadets, with guilty verdicts reviewed by the academy superintendent. Expulsion for lying, cheating or stealing remains the basic penalty, but lesser sanctions may be imposed.

 Mr. Hoffmann oversaw the transition to an all-volunteer Army in June 1973 as the Vietnam War wound down. He devoted particular attention to making sure that blacks were not concentrated in combat roles as Army studies indicated they had been. The number of black noncommissioned officers rose under his leadership, while racial incidents declined at home and overseas.

 Mr. Hoffmann helped introduce to the Army the Abrams tank, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Apache helicopter, and he authorized a Jewish chapel at West Point, capping a 20-year campaign by Jewish cadets and alumni.

 Martin Richard Hoffmann was born in Stockbridge, Mass., on April 20, 1932. He moved to Colorado Springs as a child, then went back east to attend Princeton, graduating in 1954. Facing the draft, he enlisted in the Army and became aide-de-camp to the commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division. He left active service as a first lieutenant but stayed in the Army Reserve and rose there to the rank of major. He resigned in 1975 when he became the service's civilian chief.

 Mr. Hoffmann graduated from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1961, then became a clerk for Judge Albert V. Bryan on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Virginia. He worked next as an assistant United States attorney in Washington, then was minority counsel for the House Judiciary Committee and legal counsel to Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, before becoming an aide to Mr. Schlesinger.

 His rise was also aided by his close friendship with Donald H. Rumsfeld, a fellow member of the Cap and Gown Club at Princeton who was President Ford's chief of staff and Mr. Schlesinger's successor as defense secretary. When Mr. Rumsfeld returned as defense secretary under President George W. Bush, Mr. Hoffmann advised him on the war in Afghanistan and on traumatic brain injuries suffered in combat.

 When Mr. Rumsfeld, a former Navy pilot, was a congressman in the 1960s, Mr. Hoffmann persuaded him to make his first parachute jump. He packed the chute for him.

 Mr. Hoffmann is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Margaret McCabe, who is known as Muggy; his daughter, Cecil Hoffmann Slye; his sons, William and Bernhard; his sisters, Elizabeth Longstreet, Cecil Hoffmann and Molly MacKinnon; and three grandchildren.

 An unpretentious man, Mr. Hoffmann refused a chauffeured car to drive him to and from the Pentagon when he was Army secretary, using instead his 1959 Mercedes, which he tuned himself.","The New York Times                                July 27, 2014 Sunday                               Late Edition - Final  Martin Hoffmann, Army Secretary in 1970s, Dies at 82"

 S. Parker Gilbert was a stepson and a godson of Morgan Stanley's founders, and he came of age on Wall Street when family name and pedigree were often enough to land one a job at the elite partnerships of the day, like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.

 But he also played a role in exploding this cozy world when he united a divided body of Morgan Stanley bankers behind the idea that the firm could grow and prosper only if it sold shares to the public.

 That move, and the subsequent pressures that the business faced as a public company, led to Morgan Stanley's merger in 1997 with the retail brokerage firm Dean Witter.

 And when Philip J. Purcell, a former management consultant who had little patience for the egos and attitudes of the company's investment bankers, took swift control of it, the stage was set for Mr. Gilbert -- who was then deep in retirement -- to alter his company's destiny again.

 In 2005, he lent his name, reputation and finances to a searing guerrilla war (albeit one that had as its headquarters the study in his Fifth Avenue apartment) that eventually forced Mr. Purcell from power on the assertion that his more conservative financial approach was ruining Morgan Stanley's vaunted culture.

 ''Parker was the heart and soul of Morgan Stanley,'' said Anson M. Beard Jr., a childhood friend and colleague who was also a member of a group of eight retired Morgan Stanley bankers who led the fight against Mr. Purcell. ''He was born into the firm, became C.E.O., retired and then brought about a change in leadership. He was the firm's DNA.''

 Mr. Beard remembered calling Mr. Gilbert in January 2005 to grouse that the company they loved was changing for the worse under Mr. Purcell. Mr. Beard told Mr. Gilbert that they had to do something.

 ''His response was, 'Come over to my apartment,' '' Mr. Beard recalled. Two months later, he said, they sent a letter to Mr. Purcell challenging his leadership.

 ''He knew how to build consensus and get things done,'' Mr. Beard said. ''This never would have happened without Parker.''

 Such was Mr. Gilbert's belief in Morgan Stanley that even when it seemed that the company could follow Lehman Brothers and go bankrupt during the financial crisis, he consistently bought shares in it, even as the stock value sank to single digits.

 John J. Mack, who succeeded Mr. Purcell as chief executive in 2005, said of Mr. Gilbert in an interview: ''I would call him every few days during the crisis -- I mean, he was such a big part of Morgan Stanley, I just wanted him to know what was going on. We were really stressed in those days, but every time I got off the phone with him, I would feel so much better.''

 Seymour Parker Gilbert III (who never used the Roman numerals) was born on Nov. 15, 1933. His father was a financial wunderkind of sorts who in the years after World War I played a critical role for the United States government in the negotiations over German war reparations.

 Mr. Gilbert's father died at 45, and his mother later married Harold Stanley, who after the split with J. P. Morgan became the first president of Morgan Stanley. Mr. Gilbert's godfather was the firm's other founder, Henry S. Morgan.

 Mr. Gilbert was educated at the Buckley School, Hotchkiss and Yale. After a stint in the Army, he joined Morgan Stanley in 1960 and was elected partner in 1969.

 Working primarily as a corporate banker, Mr. Gilbert was appointed to lead the firm in 1984 at 49.

 At the time, Wall Street competitors like Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns had already gone public, and Mr. Gilbert was facing mounting pressure from the firm's younger bankers for Morgan Stanley to do the same to compete on larger, more lucrative banking deals.

 Older partners feared that such a move would have a disastrous effect on the firm's culture.

 Mr. Gilbert was ultimately able to make the case that going public was the right thing to do, and the firm did so in 1986.

 He retired in 1990 and devoted time and money to the Morgan Library and Museum, which he led from 1988 to 2011. He was also a longtime trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

 Mr. Gilbert lived in Manhattan. In addition to his son S. Parker Jr., known as Parker, he is survived by his wife, Gail; a daughter, Lynn Tudor; another son, David, a novelist; and eight grandchildren.

 About a year ago, Mr. Gilbert made a rare trip to Morgan Stanley to give a speech to the company's managing directors.

 As was his style, his talk was brief but carried a powerful punch: Morgan Stanley's culture was back, he said, a person who attended the event recalled.

 The standing ovation lasted longer than Mr. Gilbert's remarks, this person said: about four minutes, with a number of bankers shedding a tear or two.","The New York Times                               May 30, 2015 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  S.

"Martin Anderson, a conservative economist who helped shape American economic policy in the 1980s as a top adviser to President Ronald Reagan, died on Saturday at his home in Portola Valley, Calif.",46596,2015-01-07 00:00:00,"Martin Anderson, a conservative economist who helped shape American economic policy in the 1980s as a top adviser to President Ronald Reagan, died on Saturday at his home in Portola Valley, Calif. He was 78.

 The Hoover Institution at Stanford, a public policy think tank where Mr. Anderson was a senior fellow, confirmed his death.

 Mr. Anderson also served under Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and George H. W. Bush, but his strongest ties were with Reagan. As a member of the president's inner circle, Mr. Anderson is credited with helping to shape Reagan's economic policies, which called for broad tax cuts, decreased social spending, increased military spending and significant deregulation of industries and markets.

 Mr. Anderson wrote, co-wrote or edited more than a dozen books, including several about Reagan. Next month, Hoover's publishing imprint will release his final book, ''Ronald Reagan: Decisions of Greatness,'' which he wrote with his wife, Annelise Anderson, a frequent collaborator and a research fellow at Hoover, who also served under President Reagan.

 In a statement, Nancy Reagan said that the Andersons had written some of the ''best books'' about her husband's presidency.

 ''He was a dear friend, and an integral part of my husband's campaigns and White House senior staff,'' Mrs. Reagan said.

 Mr. Anderson served on the board of the Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library from 1985 to 1990. He visited it frequently and, until his death, held a security clearance to give him access to some of the foundation's files, according to a spokeswoman, Joanne Drake.

 Born in Lowell, Mass., on Aug. 5, 1936, Mr. Anderson graduated from Dartmouth College before earning a master's degree in engineering and business administration. He received a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and went on to teach at Columbia University's business school. He joined the Hoover Institution as a fellow in 1971.

 Mr. Anderson often interrupted his political, writing and teaching careers to serve on political campaigns. He advised multiple presidents on issues like domestic policy, missile defense and ending the military draft, the Hoover Institution said.

 He helped advise Nixon on his bid for the White House in 1968 and was later a special consultant to him. He went on to help Reagan win the presidency in 1980 and continued as a top policy adviser in the White House for two more years.

 An expert on welfare and relations between state and federal governments, Mr. Anderson published his first book, ''The Federal Bulldozer: A Critical Analysis of Urban Renewal, 1949-1962,'' in 1964. Years later he became a crucial architect of Reagan's New Federalism -- the handing over control of government programs to the states.

 Mr. Anderson resigned from the Reagan administration in 1982, citing personal reasons, but remained a staunch defender of the president's policies. He and his wife edited ''Reagan, in His Own Hand'' (2001), a collection of Reagan's essays, one of which they found in his desk.

 In addition to his wife, Mr. Anderson is survived by a half brother, James McHugh Jr.","The New York Times                             January 7, 2015 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  Martin Anderson, 78, an Adviser to Reagan"
"Roger M. Adelman, a government lawyer whose unsuccessful prosecution of John W. Hinckley Jr. in the 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan and his press secretary, James S. Brady, led to significant changes in the law governing the insanity defense in criminal trials, died on Sept. 12 at his home in Washington.",58307,2015-09-19 00:00:00,"Roger M. Adelman, a government lawyer whose unsuccessful prosecution of John W. Hinckley Jr. in the 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan and his press secretary, James S. Brady, led to significant changes in the law governing the insanity defense in criminal trials, died on Sept. 12 at his home in Washington. He was 74.

 The cause was complications of congestive heart failure, said Daniel E. Toomey, a friend who worked with Mr. Adelman in the United States attorney's office in Washington.

 Mr. Adelman was a senior prosecutor in that office when Mr. Hinckley shot the president on March 30, 1981, outside the Washington Hilton hotel, where Reagan had just addressed labor leaders. Mingling with onlookers, Mr. Hinckley opened fire with a revolver as Reagan left the hotel, wounding Mr. Brady, a District of Columbia police officer, a Secret Service agent and, finally, the president, whom Secret Service agents hustled into his limousine.

 Mr. Brady, who was shot in the head, sustained brain damage and was partly paralyzed. He died in August 2014, and the Northern Virginia medical examiner, 33 years after the shooting, ruled the death a homicide. At the trial, lawyers for the defense argued that Mr. Hinckley lived in a fantasy world, obsessed with the film ''Taxi Driver'' and its young star Jodie Foster, whom he had hoped to impress by assassinating the president.

 Mr. Adelman argued that Mr. Hinckley, despite his obsessions, had not acted on impulse but had carried out a carefully considered scheme. ''This was not a random or thoughtless act,'' he told the jury on the opening day of the trial. Rather, he said, it was ''planned, thought out, calculated.''

 In his closing argument, Mr. Adelman said: ''The time has come for John Hinckley Jr., for the first time in his life, to take responsibility for what he's done. He can't avoid responsibility for shooting President Reagan.''

 The jury found Mr. Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity, a decision that shocked the public and lawmakers across the country. He was sent for treatment to St. Elizabeths, a psychiatric hospital in Washington, where he has been confined ever since.

 In 1984, in direct response to the verdict, Congress passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which set a higher bar for the insanity defense in federal courts.

 Previously, defendants could be found not guilty by reason of insanity if it could be shown that, because of a mental disease or defect, they could not control themselves well enough to obey the law or could not tell the difference between right and wrong. Under the new law, lack of control was no longer a defense.

 ''The Hinckley verdict had a huge impact on insanity defense law,'' Christopher Slobogin, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who has written extensively on the law and mental health, said in an email. ''In the direct wake of the verdict, several states abolished the defense, and well over half the states significantly reduced its scope. Since Hinckley's trial, the insanity defense has never been the same.''

 Roger Mark Adelman was born on June 25, 1941, in Norristown, Pa., where his father, Louis, and his mother, the former Mary Butz, ran a retail carpet store. He played football and basketball at Norristown Area High School. At Dartmouth College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1963, he was a varsity rower.

 After receiving his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1966, Mr. Adelman served in the Army, which sent him to its language school in Monterey, Calif., to learn Russian.

 On completing his military service, he began working for the United States attorney's office in Washington, prosecuting homicides, robberies and kidnappings, as well as white-collar crime and some of the earliest organized-crime cases under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, statute.

 As part of the F.B.I. sting operation known as Abscam, he helped prosecute Representative Richard Kelly, a Florida Republican who had been videotaped accepting $25,000 in bribe money from undercover agents who he thought were representatives of an Arab sheikh hoping to buy political influence.

 ''At trial, he claimed he took the money not because he was corrupt but because he wanted to turn in the man to the F.B.I. who had offered him the money,'' Mr. Adelman told the magazine Washington Lawyer in 2007. ''As it turned out, the man who paid him the money was an undercover F.B.I. agent. Not surprisingly, that defense did not get too far with the jury.'' Mr. Kelly was found guilty of bribery and conspiracy at his 1981 trial and served 13 months in prison.

 In 1988, Mr. Adelman became a partner in the law firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart (now K&L Gates), specializing in criminal defense work. He briefly assisted Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, as he investigated possible ethical violations by President Bill Clinton's administration in the firing of seven employees of the White House Travel Office. Travelgate, as it was known, evaporated when Mr. Starr declined to bring charges.

 In 1997, Mr. Adelman started his own law firm, specializing in white-collar defense work and class-action litigation against tobacco companies. He taught evidence and criminal procedure at the Georgetown University Law Center for 25 years before retiring in 1998.

 In May, the Council for Court Excellence gave him its Justice Potter Stewart Award for his contributions to the administration of justice in Washington.

 Mr. Adelman, who leaves no immediate survivors, told Washington Lawyer that serving as an assistant attorney with the United States attorney's office was ''the best job a trial lawyer can have.''

 When asked to explain, he said: ''Well, it starts with the fact that as an assistant U.S. attorney you can stand up in court and say, 'Ladies and gentlemen, I represent the United States.' There are few other places in life that you can do that, especially at 28 years old.''","The New York Times                            September 19, 2015 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Roger Adelman, 74, Government Lawyer Who Prosecuted Reagan's 1981 Assailant"
"Yitzhak Navon, who took part in the founding of Israel, served as its fifth president, from 1978 to 1983, in a largely ceremonial role, and then returned to politics as a Labor Party legislator and minister of education, died late Friday night at his home here.",54777,2015-11-09 00:00:00,"JERUSALEM -- Yitzhak Navon, who took part in the founding of Israel, served as its fifth president, from 1978 to 1983, in a largely ceremonial role, and then returned to politics as a Labor Party legislator and minister of education, died late Friday night at his home here. He was 94.

 His death was announced by the president's office.

 The scion of an old Jerusalem family -- his father was a descendant of exiles from Spain who came to the city from Turkey in 1670, and his mother's family arrived from Morocco about 200 years later -- Mr. Navon was one of a fading generation of Israeli state builders.

 Entering public life immediately after Israel's establishment in 1948, he began in the foreign service, then served as chief of staff to David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, and to Moshe Sharett when he succeeded Ben-Gurion.

 ''Time after time you were there, at the pivotal junctures, always in a significant position,'' Reuven Rivlin, the current president of Israel, said in a eulogy on Sunday as Mr. Navon's body lay in state at the president's residence.

 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Mr. Navon as ''one of the nation's finest and among its greatest builders.''

 ''With his personality and proficiency in the Arabic language,'' Mr. Netanyahu said in remarks at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, ''he also worked to bridge between Israel and its Arab neighbors, especially Egypt.''

 Mr. Navon was also fluent in Ladino, the Judeo-Spanish language of the Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492, and he strove to preserve Jewish Ladino traditions.

 As a writer and playwright, Mr. Navon created several acclaimed works dealing with Sephardic heritage, including the musical ''Sephardic Garden,'' which Mr. Rivlin described as ''a landmark in Israeli culture.''

 Mr. Navon became a unifying figure in a polarized Israel, where ethnic tensions ran rampant between Sephardic Jewish immigrants from North Africa and Asia and the state-founding Ashkenazi elite of European origin.

 For many Israelis, Mr. Navon was also a man of the people who would shop at the market and chat as easily with the vendors as with heads of state.

 ''He represents a bygone era, our parents' era,'' said Hagit Caspi, 63, a Jerusalem resident who came to pay her respects at the president's residence. ''He represents a Jerusalem of old, where people were more innocent, nobody locked their doors and everybody spoke each others' languages.''

 Born on April 9, 1921, to Yosef and Miryam Navon, Mr. Navon graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he studied Islamic culture, Arabic language and Hebrew literature.

 During the 1948 war, he headed the Arab division at the Information Section of the Haganah, the pre-state Jewish paramilitary organization.

 He married Ofira Erez, a psychologist, in 1963. She died of leukemia in 1993. Mr. Navon is survived by his second wife, Miri Shafir Navon; a daughter, Naama; a son, Erez; and several grandchildren.

 Mr. Navon was first elected to the Knesset in 1965 as a member of Ben-Gurion's Rafi Party, which later aligned with other political factions to form the Labor Party.

 As president he toured Israel extensively, and in 1980, after Israel's peace treaty with Egypt, he paid a state visit to Egypt as the guest of President Anwar Sadat, who described him as a ''friend.'' It was the first visit of an Israeli head of state to an Arab country.

 After the massacre carried out by the Christian Phalange militia in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila during the Lebanon War of 1982, Mr. Navon demanded that an official commission of inquiry be convened to ascertain the extent of Israeli responsibility. Mr. Rivlin said that Mr. Navon had threatened to resign had the Kahan Commission not been formed.

 After leaving office as president, Mr. Navon returned to the Knesset and also served as education minister from 1984 to 1990.

 In an interview with the Hebrew newspaper Yediot Aharonot a few months ago, Mr. Navon spoke wistfully of the city of his birth.

 ''Once there was a time in Jerusalem of brotherhood and peace,'' he said, when ''cultures and languages lived side by side, and not one at the expense of the other.''

 He continued, ''There was a brotherhood between modest, simple people, and whoever was called to heaven was asked to pray there and act for those who remained. I, too, when I go, will ask for the welfare of those that remain.''","The New York Times                              November 9, 2015 Monday                               Late Edition - Final  Yitzhak Navon, 94, Dies; President of Israel Who Bridged Divisions"

He was 76.

 His lawyer, Judy Tint, said Mr. King, who lived in Teaneck, N.J., died at Hackensack University Medical Center after a brief illness, offering no further details.

 Mr. King was working in his father's Harlem luncheonette in 1956 when a local impresario, Lover Patterson, overheard him singing to himself and persuaded him to join a group he managed, the Five Crowns.

 Lightning struck when the group, then known as the Crowns, performed at the Apollo Theater on a bill with the original Drifters in 1958 and attracted the attention of George Treadwell, who managed the Drifters and owned the name.

 [Video: Watch on YouTube.]

 Mr. Treadwell had been feuding with his group, which had entered a lean period after Clyde McPhatter, its lead singer, was drafted into the Army in late 1954. He fired the Drifters en masse and replaced them with Mr. King and three of his fellow singers.

 Atlantic Records assigned the songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller to produce the group's recordings. The match turned out to be inspired, yielding a streak of hit records that helped the Drifters achieve crossover success. Mr. King's suave but impassioned vocals had a lot to do with it.

 ''He had a way of retaining a gospel grit in his voice but at the same had an easy, debonair style that was appealing and ingratiating,'' said Ken Emerson, the author of ''Always Magic in the Air: The Bomp and Brilliance of the Brill Building Era,'' about the Midtown Manhattan center of pop music songwriting.

 ''There Goes My Baby,'' released in 1959, reached No. 2 on the pop charts. It was followed by ''Dance With Me,'' ''This Magic Moment,'' ''I Count the Tears,'' ''Lonely Winds'' and ''Save the Last Dance for Me,'' a No. 1 hit.

 Mr. King left the Drifters in 1960 and embarked on a successful solo career. ''Spanish Harlem,'' written by Mr. Leiber with Phil Spector, reached the Top 10 that year. ''Stand by Me,'' which Mr. King helped write, reached the Top 10 in 1961 and again in 1986, when it was used in the soundtrack of the Rob Reiner film of the same name.

 ''Because he recorded the work of so many great songwriters, his own songwriting is often overlooked,'' Mr. Emerson said. ''But he co-wrote 'There Goes My Baby,' and 'Stand by Me' originated with him.'' He was also the principal writer of ''Dance With Me.''

 Rolling Stone ranked ''Stand by Me'' 122nd on its list of the 500 greatest songs. In 1999 BMI, the music licensing organization, announced that it was the fourth-most-recorded song of the 20th century, having been played more than seven million times on radio and television.

 Mr. King was born Benjamin Earl Nelson on Sept. 28, 1938, in Henderson, N.C., and grew up in Harlem, where his father had moved the family when he was a child. He took the surname King, which belonged to a favorite uncle, soon after joining the Drifters.

 He began singing in church choirs and during high school formed a doo-wop group, the Four B's, that occasionally performed at the Apollo. ''To me, singing was fun,'' he said in a 1993 interview with the website Classic Bands. ''I never even visualized for a second doing what I'm doing.''

 Mr. King was similarly offhand in describing his songwriting. In an interview with Bill Millar, the author of ''The Drifters: The Rise and Fall of the Black Vocal Group'' (1971), he said, ''I'd sit down with this old guitar I have that's missing all but three strings -- no one else could play it, but I pick out tunes, and, when I have something, I'll play it for someone who can write it.''

 He was singing with the Five Crowns when, in 1958, the group signed with R&B Records, a fledgling label run by the songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. As the Crowns, the group recorded one song, ''Kiss and Make Up,'' before the company went out of business. The relationship proved fruitful, however. Pomus and Shuman went on to write ''This Magic Moment'' with Mr. King, as well as ''Save the Last Dance for Me.''

 Recording for Atco, a subsidiary of Atlantic, Mr. King scored modest successes in the 1960s with ''Don't Play That Song (You Lied),'' ''I (Who Have Nothing),'' ''Seven Letters'' and ''Tears, Tears, Tears.'' In 1968, he performed on the single ''Soul Meeting,'' a minor hit for the Soul Clan, an Atlantic supergroup whose members also included Solomon Burke and Joe Tex.

 By the end of the decade his career was in decline. He rebounded with the 1975 funk hit ''Supernatural Thing, Part 1,'' and in 1977 recorded a well-regarded album with the Average White Band, ''Benny and Us.'' He continued to turn out albums for Atlantic into the 1980s, recording ''Let Me Live in Your Life'' (1978), ''Music Trance'' (1980) and ''Street Tough'' (1981).

 Mr. King later recorded for a variety of independent labels and performed regularly in clubs and small concert halls in the United States and abroad.

 He is survived by his mother, Jenny Nelson; his wife, Betty King; two daughters, Terris Cannon and Angela Matos; a son, Benjamin Jr.; four sisters, Joyce Powell, Gladys Johnson, Deborah Nelson and Stacy Nelson; three brothers, Jeffrey, Calvin and Billy; and six grandchildren.

 ''I still think my whole career was accidental,'' Mr. King told Classic Bands. ''I didn't pursue it. I feel like I'm cheating sometimes.''","The New York Times                                May 2, 2015 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Ben E.

"Mr. Santucci, a former Queens district attorney, drew praise and controversy in trials involving municipal corruption, police conduct and a racial attack.",23046,2016-06-26 00:00:00,"HIGHLIGHT:Mr. Santucci, a former Queens district attorney, drew praise and controversy in trials involving municipal corruption, police conduct and a racial attack.

 John J. Santucci, who as the Queens district attorney from 1977 to 1991 became a lightning rod of controversy in high-profile cases involving a fatal racial attack, a municipal corruption scandal and allegations of lethal police brutality, died on Sunday in Mineola, N.Y. He was 85.

 His death was confirmed by a grandson, John T. Santucci.

 Mr. Santucci gained wide attention in December 1986 after one of the most explosive racially motivated crimes in the city at the time - an attack on three black men in Howard Beach, Queens, by a gang of white teenagers, who chased one man onto a highway, where he was struck and killed by a car.

 The two other men and their lawyers refused to cooperate with Mr. Santucci's office, contending that it had joined in an attempt to cover up vital aspects of the episode. Mr. Santucci denied the accusation, but he said that with the case at an impasse he had no choice but to turn it over to a specially appointed state prosecutor.

 That prosecutor, Charles J. Hynes, who later became Brooklyn's district attorney, won manslaughter convictions against three of the attackers, while six others were convicted of lesser charges.

 Earlier in 1986, Mr. Santucci had been both praised and pilloried in connection with a corruption scandal involving allegations of bribery schemes at city agencies.

 One defendant was John A. Zaccaro, the husband of Geraldine A. Ferraro, who had been an assistant district attorney under Mr. Santucci before she was elected to Congress and became the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1984. Another was Francis X. Smith, the state's judicial administrator in Queens and a former president of the New York City Council, who had been a longtime friend of Mr. Santucci's.

 Mr. Santucci prosecuted Mr. Zaccaro on charges that he had joined the Queens borough president, Donald R. Manes, in trying to extort a bribe from a cable television company that had unsuccessfully sought a franchise in Queens. Mr. Santucci prosecuted Mr. Smith on perjury charges for his grand jury testimony about meetings and conversations that were said to have been part of the extortion attempt.

 Mr. Zaccaro was acquitted; Mr. Smith was convicted and served two months in jail.

 Mr. Santucci's supporters said the prosecutions showed that he had not let personal relationships keep him from doing his job. But Ms. Ferraro denounced Mr. Santucci, contending that he had prosecuted her husband only to burnish his image and share the spotlight in an investigation that had been begun by federal prosecutors.

 Indeed, some of Mr. Santucci's critics maintained that his office had been lax in investigating political corruption in Queens. They noted that Mr. Manes was a central figure in the bribery plots that had been exposed by the federal prosecutors, headed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Manes committed suicide before he could be prosecuted.

 Mr. Santucci disputed the accusation of laxity. He said in an interview with The New York Times in 1987 that he had investigated separate allegations of payoffs to Mr. Manes before the 1986 scandal, but that he had been unable to make a case. In any event, he hired a special assistant, Paul W. Pickelle, a prosecutor from Westchester County without ties to the Queens establishment, to pursue cases related to Mr. Manes that were not being handled by Mr. Giuliani's office.

 The resulting cable television cases, Mr. Santucci said in 1987, had caused him personal pain. ""It was no fun for me with the Smith and Zaccaro indictments, especially Smith,"" he said. ""I knew Smith since 1958.""

 The rancorous case involving accusations of fatal police brutality began in 1991, when Mr. Santucci won the indictments of five police officers on murder charges. The officers said the victim, a car-theft suspect, had violently resisted arrest; prosecutors said one officer had choked the man.

 Some legal experts said the murder charges against the four other officers were a legal stretch. Mr. Santucci said they were warranted because all the officers had ""acted in concert"" and ""all had some physical contact"" with the suspect. Witnesses said the victim had been punched and kicked by the officers.

 But less than three months after the indictments, Mr. Santucci retired, in the middle of his fourth elected term, and his successor, Richard A. Brown, dropped all charges against the four other officers and reduced the charges against the one alleged to have done the choking to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The officer was acquitted of both charges at trial.

 The controversial episodes in Mr. Santucci's tenure involved only a few of the thousands of investigations, plea deals and trials that cram the calendar of a big-city prosecutor's office.

 ""If you examine the totality of his work over 14 years, he's run a fairly good office,"" Thomas J. Manton, then a member of Congress and the chairman of the Queens Democratic Party, said when Mr. Santucci retired.

 Mr. Manton and others said that in some years Mr. Santucci's office had the highest percentage of convictions in felony trials among the city's district attorneys. And his office won convictions of police officers in another highly publicized case, involving the torture of drug suspects with an electric stun gun at a station house, in 1985.

 Some of the controversies swirling around Mr. Santucci had nothing to do with prosecutions. In 1986, news reports disclosed that three years earlier he had spent at least seven hours at a private luncheon with a group that included a businessman who the F.B.I. and the police said had ties to organized crime.

 Mr. Santucci responded that at the time of the luncheon he had not known this. He also said that those who made much of the matter were seeking to link him to organized crime because he was Italian-American.

 That Mr. Santucci would spend so much time with anybody at lunch did not surprise those who knew him. ""He likes to talk, likes to schmooze, likes to be liked by everybody,"" one aide said.

 John Joseph Santucci was born in Queens on April 2, 1931. He earned a law degree from St. John's University and was an assistant district attorney in the borough from 1958 to 1964. He was later a member of the City Council for four years and a state senator for nine.

 Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed him district attorney for an interim one-year term beginning Jan. 1, 1977, to fill a vacancy. Mr. Santucci went on to be elected to four four-year terms of his own.

 He is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Edna Ann Hayes; three sons, Thomas, John Jr. and Robert; three daughters, Mary Panvini, Carol Santucci and Edna Masone; two brothers, Thomas, a cardiologist, and Fred, a retired justice of the Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court; and 12 grandchildren. He had homes in Garden City, N.Y., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

 In 2014, Mr. Santucci's family established the John J. Santucci Justice Scholarship at Touro Law School.

 Mr. Santucci initially envisioned the district attorney post as a steppingstone to higher office. In 1978, less than a year into his first full term, he made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for state attorney general. In 1980 he ran in his party's primary for the United States Senate and lost. It was his last attempt at higher office.

 In the 1987 interview, Mr. Santucci said, ""I never thought I'd be here 10 years.""

Bush as inspector general of the Corporation for National and Community Service.

 Gerald Walpin, a former inspector general for the Corporation for National and Community Service whose 2009 firing by President Obama was harshly criticized by Republicans, died on Friday after being struck by a vehicle while crossing the street in Manhattan. He was 84.

 Mr. Walpin was walking home from a doctor's appointment when he was hit in the crosswalk on 79th Street and Lexington Avenue by a sport utility vehicle making a left turn, his family and the police said. The vehicle's driver, Milton Kazi, was arrested on Saturday and given a desk appearance ticket for a failure to yield. He was released later in the day.

 A lawyer with a long career, Mr. Walpin was appointed by President George W. Bush as the watchdog of the agency that runs AmeriCorps, which provides living allowances and education grants to volunteers for community groups. He was sworn in in January 2007 and continued to serve after Mr. Obama became president in 2009.

 By then, an investigation had begun into the use of $800,000 in federal AmeriCorps money at a school run by an Obama supporter, Kevin Johnson, a former National Basketball Association player who became mayor of Sacramento. Mr. Walpin said some of the money was used improperly and recommended that Mr. Johnson and Dana Gonzalez, who both had run the school, the St. Hope Academy of California, face criminal charges.

 The United States attorney in Sacramento at the time, Lawrence G. Brown, determined that no criminal wrongdoing had occurred. The school paid $424,000 in April 2009 to settle accusations over its use of grant money.

 After Mr. Walpin was dismissed in June of that year, he suggested that the firing had been related to reports in which he was critical of programs receiving money from AmeriCorps, including St. Hope. ""I can only say that I became a thorn in the side of someone, because I was doing my job,"" Mr. Walpin told the conservative commentator Glenn Beck on Fox News.

 The White House said Mr. Walpin was incompetent and had behaved bizarrely, and it pointed to an ethics complaint about Mr. Walpin's actions related to the case.

 ""I think for them to say that I was disoriented is an amazing, amazing flinging of mud,"" Mr. Walpin told Mr. Beck. ""I believe when I'm doing my work that I call the cards as they come out.""

 Mr. Walpin's daughter Amanda Leath described her father as a staunch conservative. In 1999, he wrote a letter to The New York Times that cited a Supreme Court ruling to defend Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York for his criticism of an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum. He was active in the Federalist Society, and, after he left the inspector general's post, wrote a book, ""The Supreme Court vs. the Constitution,"" critical of what he saw as judicial activism.

 Gerald Walpin was born on Sept. 1, 1931, in the Bronx, the youngest of three sons of Michael Walpin, who ran a business fixing fire extinguishers, and the former Mary Gordon. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School and studied at the City College of New York. He graduated cum laude from Yale Law School in 1955, where he was managing editor of the law journal.

 He married Sheila Kainer in 1957. They lived in Buzanais, France, when Mr. Walprin's worked for the judge advocate general for the United States Air Force from 1957 to 1960.

 When they returned to New York, Mr. Walpin was an assistant United States attorney in the Southern District until 1965. He went on to work in litigation for the firm Rosenman Colin Freund Lewis & Cohen.

 Since his firing in 2009, Mr. Walpin had been writing, speaking and giving legal advice, Ms. Leath said.

 In addition to his wife and Ms. Leath, he is survived by a son, Edward; another daughter, Jennifer Tananbaum; and six grandchildren.

"Benjamin F. Payton, a civil rights advocate who was instrumental in transforming the historically black Tuskegee Institute in Alabama into the more broadly encompassing Tuskegee University over nearly three decades as its president, died on Sept. 28 in Estero, Fla.",28130,2016-10-12 00:00:00,"Benjamin F. Payton, a civil rights advocate who was instrumental in transforming the historically black Tuskegee Institute in Alabama into the more broadly encompassing Tuskegee University over nearly three decades as its president, died on Sept. 28 in Estero, Fla. He was 83.

 His death was announced by the university, which was founded in a shanty in Tuskegee, Ala., in 1881 by Booker T. Washington.

 Almost 100 years later, overcoming alumni objections and hoping to broaden its appeal, Dr. Payton enlarged the scope and the very identity of Tuskegee by pushing to give it university status.

 His plan was adopted in 1985, and soon afterward he established Tuskegee's first doctoral program, created a College of Business and Information Science, the General Daniel ''Chappie'' James Center for Aerospace Science and Health Education, and the Continuing Education Program. He oversaw fund-raising campaigns that generated about $240 million.

 He also won an apology from the United States, delivered by President Bill Clinton in 1997, for the federal government's infamous four-decade ''Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male.'' In the study, beginning in 1932, penicillin and other available treatments were deliberately withheld from more than 600 research subjects with venereal disease: poor black men from Macon County, whose county seat is Tuskegee.

 The government, in association with the staff at Tuskegee, had enlisted the men under the guise of providing free health care. Dozens of men died, and many of their families were infected.

 ''People call it the Tuskegee experiment, but it wasn't Tuskegee that did it -- it was the United States Public Health Service, and it went on for 40 years,'' Dr. Payton told The Montgomery Advertiser in 2010. ''The apology was long overdue.''

 Mr. Clinton also announced a $200,000 grant to start a National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care at Tuskegee.

 Dr. Payton's tenure as Tuskegee's fifth president, from 1981 to 2010, capped a lifelong religious commitment to racial justice. It began in the mid-1960s, when he was the director of the Office of Church and Race of the Protestant Council of the City of New York (now the Council of Churches of the City of New York) and then executive director of the National Council of Churches' Commission on Religion and Race.

 He helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for civil rights and economic justice. In 1965, he criticized a confidential federal report by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an assistant secretary of labor and later a United States senator from New York, which said that instability in black families needed to be addressed if poverty among African-Americans was to be mitigated.

 Dr. Payton and other critics argued that focusing on unwed mothers and their children debased blacks and blamed victims. Rather, they said, the government's agenda should be integration, education and jobs.

 Two years later, Dr. Payton urged Congress not to upend the will of Harlem voters by excluding their elected representative, the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., over corruption allegations. Powell, he said, was ''the one great symbol of power that Negroes have developed so painfully over the years.'' Congress did exclude Powell, but he was elected again.

 Dr. Payton served for five years, until 1972, as president of Benedict College in Columbia, S.C., a Baptist-affiliated black institution. Returning to New York, he became program officer for higher education and research at the Ford Foundation, a position he held for nearly a decade until his appointment at Tuskegee.

 When Dr. Payton retired to Florida in 2010, leaving Tuskegee as president emeritus, Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama said he had ''fostered innovation and academic excellence, playing a key role in Tuskegee University becoming the outstanding institution of higher learning that it is today.''

 Benjamin Franklin Payton was born on Dec. 27, 1932, in Orangeburg, S.C., the second of nine children of the Rev. Leroy Ralph Payton, an impoverished minister, farmer and teacher, and the former Sarah Mack.

 Despite their meager circumstances, the family had a passion for education; all of Dr. Payton's siblings earned college degrees. Dr. Payton received four: a bachelor's degree in sociology from South Carolina State University in 1955, a bachelor of divinity in philosophical theology from Harvard, a master's in philosophy from Columbia University and a doctorate in ethics from Yale.

 His wife, the former Thelma Plane, died in 2013. He is survived by their children, Mark and Deborah; four grandchildren; three brothers, Cecil Warren Payton, William Mack Payton and Bernard Simpson Payton; and three sisters, Mary Edith Padgett, Annette Dolores Thorpe and Gail Priscilla Floyd.

 When Dr. Payton became president of Tuskegee, he affirmed the enduring value of historically black institutions, many of whose first students were former slaves or the sons of freed slaves.

 ''You end black colleges, and youngsters will end up as serious social misfits,'' he told The New York Times in 1981. ''It will cost far more to keep them in prison than to develop their competencies. If the American people understood better what we are talking about, they would see that it is less costly, more humane and contributes more to the welfare of society to educate people than to neglect them.''

 Even as integrated colleges became more accessible, he said, ''these students no longer want the kind of environment that places the burden of proof on them to demonstrate that they're not there to meet someone's affirmative action quota.''

 In 1990, he reported progress: ''We are beginning to see a collection of institutions, both black and white, that are helping black students understand again that the single most important route out of poverty is education,'' he said.

 By the time he had retired, Dr. Payton had been president of Tuskegee longer than every one of his predecessors except Booker T. Washington himself. ''There was just so much to do,'' he told The Montgomery Advertiser, ''that I forgot about the time.''","The New York Times                             October 12, 2016 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  Benjamin Payton Dies at 83; Transformed a University"

 Correction Appended

 Cella Irvine, a Silicon Alley pioneer who led About.com and other new media companies in New York starting in the early 1990s, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59.

 The cause was thyroid cancer, her husband, Hart Hooton, said.

 Ms. Irvine broke ground in a male-dominated field in her corporate roles and as a founding board member and chairwoman of the nonprofit New York New Media Association. The group, which had 8,000 members at its peak, was acquired by the Software and Information Industry Association in 2003.

 Ms. Irvine began her quarter-century career in the digital industry in the mid-1980s at Activision, a video game and educational software company. From 1989 to 1993, she ran customer relations and strategic planning for the Prodigy Services Company before joining the Hearst Corporation in 1994 as vice president and general manager of new media.

 At Hearst, she guided its first digital ventures, including an interactive newspaper and the marketing of CD-ROMs.

 Within two years she was the general manager of Sidewalk, an early online guide to local businesses started by Microsoft. Sidewalk, described as a digital version of urban newsweeklies, emerged as one of the most heavily trafficked sites on the internet. Ms. Irvine stepped down when the guide was sold to Citysearch in 1999.

 After heading strategic planning and operations at a unit of Marsh, a risk consulting firm, she became chief administrative officer of Digitas, the digital advertising agency. There she helped integrate Modem Media and the Medical Broadcasting Company to become Digitas Health, a health care marketing firm.

 She went on to oversee a series of acquisitions that led to Digitas Health's sale to Publicis Groupe, a multinational advertising and public relations company based in France.

 Ms. Irvine became chief executive and president of the About Group of The New York Times Company in 2008. (The Times had purchased About Inc. and its website About.com in 2005 for $410 million.)

 When Ms. Irvine took over the group, About.com, as well as its other websites - ConsumerSearch.com, UCompareHealthCare.com and CalorieCount.com - were struggling at the beginning of the global economic recession and adjusting to Google's changing algorithms.

 She left in 2011. The About Group was sold the next year to Barry Diller's IAC for about $300 million in cash.

 In 2011, when Ms. Irvine became chief executive of Vibrant Media, a digital advertising company, David Kenny, the former chief executive of Digitas, told paidContent.org that she had been instrumental in planning the agency's acquisition strategy and in integrating newly acquired companies.

 She remained with Vibrant until 2013 and had been consulting since then.

 Cella Maria Irvine was born on Sept. 23, 1957, in Manhattan to the former Josephine Cella, the director of educational services for the Ballet Hispanico in Manhattan, and Bonnell Irvine, an architect and designer.

 She graduated from Friends Seminary in Manhattan and received a bachelor's degree in history from Cornell University and a master's in general management from Harvard.

 In addition to her husband, a digital marketing consultant, she is survived by their two children, Giovanna and Hudson, and her mother.

"Dr. Hahn transformed a regional military college with a mostly white, male student body into a diverse, internationally renowned research university.",22907,2016-06-04 00:00:00,"HIGHLIGHT:Dr. Hahn transformed a regional military college with a mostly white, male student body into a diverse, internationally renowned research university.

 T. Marshall Hahn Jr., who as president of Virginia Tech transformed it from a regional military college with a mostly white, mostly male student body into a diverse, internationally renowned research university, died on May 29 at his home outside Blacksburg, Va. He was 89.

 The university, in Blacksburg, announced the death.

 In 1998, in a retrospective examination of Dr. Hahn's career, The Roanoke Times called him ""the man who made Tech what it is today.""

 A physicist by training, Dr. Hahn assumed the presidency of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, as it was then known, in 1962. At the time, enrollment numbered not much more than 6,000.

 Although students at the institute's associated women's college, Radford College (now Radford University), could attend courses at Virginia Polytechnic, the student body was nominally all male. And though the institute had admitted its first black student in 1953, it remained overwhelmingly white.

 Founded in 1872 as Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College, Virginia Polytechnic had maintained a vigorous military tradition from its inception. At the time Dr. Hahn took office, participation in the college's Corps of Cadets remained mandatory for all students. But that requirement, he realized, had discouraged many prospective applicants.

 In his more than 12 years as president, Dr. Hahn created 30 new undergraduate majors, among them art, history, philosophy, sociology, psychology and management; added some 20 graduate programs; and established the colleges of arts and sciences, architecture and education.

 He also oversaw the construction of more than two dozen campus buildings.

 In 1970, the college was awarded full university status, becoming Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, its formal name to this day.

 In a move that incensed many alumni donors, Dr. Hahn eliminated compulsory cadet service in 1964. That year he also severed ties with Radford College and began admitting women to the regular student body.

 In 1965, aided by a $100,000 grant, Dr. Hahn established a scholarship program for enrollees of modest means, with most of the money earmarked for black students. The grant, from the Rockefeller Foundation, was believed to have been the first for this purpose awarded to a Southern land-grant college.

 In an article about the award that year, The New York Times wrote, ""Although it would seem to be a risky matter for a virtually all-white state college in the South to espouse a program that will bring in a sizable number of Negroes - 'token' integration is still the rule at many Southern institutions that must look to the state for support - Dr. Hahn declares that the venture was 'extremely well received, almost surprisingly so,' in the community.""

 By the time Dr. Hahn left the presidency in 1974, Virginia Tech's enrollment had nearly tripled, to 17,400. Today, its student body comprises roughly 17,000 men and 13,000 women. More than 1,100 students identify themselves as African-American, more than 1,500 as Hispanic and more than 2,500 as Asian.

 The son of Thomas Marshall Hahn and the former Elizabeth Boston, Thomas Marshall Hahn Jr. was born on Dec. 2, 1926, in Lexington, Ky. A brilliant student, he parted company with his high school long before the traditional graduation age because, the school said, it had no more to teach him.

 By the time he was 18, he had earned a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Kentucky. At 23, after two years' naval service, he received a doctorate in the field from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

 Dr. Hahn joined the Virginia Polytechnic physics faculty in 1954, becoming the department chairman. He left in 1959 to take a post as dean of arts and sciences at what is now Kansas State University, before returning in 1962 to become, at 35, Virginia Polytechnic's 11th president.

 After leaving the university in 1974, Dr. Hahn became an executive vice president of Georgia-Pacific, the paper company. He retired in 1993 as the company's chief executive.

 Dr. Hahn's first wife, the former Margaret Louise Lee, known as Peggy, whom he married in 1948, died in 2009. His survivors include two daughters, Anne Hahn Hurst and Betty Hahn, and three grandchildren. His second marriage, to Jean Quible, ended in divorce; a son, William, from Dr. Hahn's first marriage, died before him.

 In an interview with The Roanoke Times in 1991, Dr. Hahn described taking the helm of Virginia Polytechnic and glimpsing the vast potential beneath its surface.

 ""I saw Virginia Tech as a sleeping giant that could be awakened,"" he said. ""I thought the time was right.""

"Howard A. Schmidt, a computer crime expert who advised two presidents and drafted cybersecurity safeguards that were approved by Congress in 2015, died on Thursday at his home in Muskego, Wis.",50827,2017-03-04 00:00:00,"Howard A. Schmidt, a computer crime expert who advised two presidents and drafted cybersecurity safeguards that were approved by Congress in 2015, died on Thursday at his home in Muskego, Wis. He was 67.

 The cause was brain cancer, his wife, Raemarie, said.

 The legislation, which evolved from precautions he proposed several years earlier, enabled government and industry to share information about potential risks from attackers' codes and techniques, shielded companies from liability lawsuits for trading data and provided privacy protections for consumers.

 By the time the congressional legislation was finally approved, though, critics complained that it had been diluted in response to corporate concerns and was already technologically anachronistic.

 Recruited by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Mr. Schmidt returned to the White House under President Barack Obama.

 He also oversaw the creation of the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, an online authentication program less vulnerable than ordinary passwords to hackers engaged in identity theft or in stealing secrets from private industry or government.

 Mr. Schmidt won the trust of much of the business community, which was fending off a barrage of cyberattacks but which also feared government intrusion and a damper on innovation. At the same time, he suggested that the threat of full-scale cyberwarfare between governments was exaggerated and that any such conflict would be unwinnable.

 With the United States portraying itself as a victim of cyberwarfare and much of the world viewing Washington as a perpetrator -- citing attacks on Iran's nuclear program as an example -- the White House proclaimed its first formal international cyberspace strategy during Mr. Schmidt's tenure.

 That strategy mirrored the planned response to other security threats, in which the United States reserved the right to use all necessary diplomatic and military means to defend itself in the event of a hostile cyberincident. Meanwhile, Mr. Schmidt said, nations were already acting defensively.

 ''Governments are starting to say, 'In order to best protect my country, I need to find vulnerabilities in other countries,''' he told The New York Times in 2013. ''The problem is that we all fundamentally become less secure.''

 He said hackers exploited the fear that if one buyer failed to pay for secret information about a computer coding flaw, another would.

 ''If someone comes to you with a bug that could affect millions of devices and says, 'You would be the only one to have this if you pay my fee,' there will always be someone inclined to pay it,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, dancing with the devil in cyberspace has been pretty common.''

 For much of his 40-year career, Mr. Schmidt was in the forefront of information technology and computer security for the military, government agencies and private industry. Most recently he was a partner with Tom Ridge, the former Homeland Security secretary, in Ridge Schmidt Cyber, a security consultancy.

 In the mid-1990s, while working for the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Mr. Schmidt was credited with helping to establish the federal government's first full-time computer forensic laboratory. He also served as chief security officer at Microsoft and chief information security officer at eBay.

 Mr. Schmidt was the president's special adviser for cyberspace security in the Bush administration from late 2001 to 2003; he was also chairman of the president's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board.

 The Obama administration recruited him in late 2009 to be its computer security adviser. He reported to the National Security Council.

 Mr. Schmidt was the first president of the Information Security Forum, an industry and government coalition, and was chief security strategist for a partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and a cybersecurity program at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

 Howard Anthony Schmidt was born on Oct. 5, 1949, in Philadelphia to Anthony and Edith Schmidt. He served three tours in the Air Force in Vietnam from 1968 to 1974; was a police officer in Chandler, Ariz.; and worked for the F.B.I. at the National Drug Intelligence Center.

 He graduated from the University of Phoenix in 1994 with a bachelor of science degree in business administration and earned a master's degree from that university.

 In addition to his wife, the former Raemarie Lange, a forensic scientist, Mr. Schmidt is survived by his mother, Edith Curtis; his stepmother, Gloria Schmidt; his sons, Kyle, David, Andrew and Anthony; and eight grandchildren.

"Murray Lerner, whose documentaries captured some of the world's greatest folk and rock musicians in era-defining performances, died on Saturday at his home in Long Island City, Queens.",33480,2017-09-06 00:00:00,"Murray Lerner, whose documentaries captured some of the world's greatest folk and rock musicians in era-defining performances, died on Saturday at his home in Long Island City, Queens. He was 90.

 The cause was kidney failure, his assistant, Eliot Kissileff, said.

 Mr. Lerner filmed the Newport Folk Festival for four years in the early and middle 1960s, including the much-referenced moment when Bob Dylan plugged in an electric guitar. He also filmed the volatile 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, where commercial and communal sensibilities collided.

 But an entirely different type of music brought him his only Oscar, for ''From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China,'' which was named best documentary feature in 1981.

 Murray Lerner was born on May 8, 1927, in Philadelphia. His father, Nacham, left the family soon after; he was raised by his mother, the former Goldie Levine, in New York.

 Mr. Lerner graduated from Harvard in 1948 with a poetry degree, but also with the beginnings of a career: While there, he had helped create a film production society and had begun teaching himself how to be a filmmaker.

 His first feature-length documentary was an underwater film called ''Secrets of the Reef,'' which he directed with Lloyd Ritter and Robert M. Young in 1956. But it was his decision to document the Newport Folk Festival in 1963 that proved pivotal.

 He would return to that event for the next three years, coming away with hours of film of Mr. Dylan, Joan Baez, Mississippi John Hurt, Johnny Cash, Donovan, Peter, Paul and Mary, and more.

 His first documentary made from that footage, ''Festival,'' came out in 1967. The images shot by Mr. Lerner have become an important archival trove, capturing a cultural moment, and the film was nominated for an Oscar.

 (One critic, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, however, was put off by the mumbling and inarticulateness of both performers and audience members in ''Festival.'' '' You know' is constantly interjected, even in the middle of sentences, to cover or even dismiss an inadequately clarified thought,'' he wrote in his review. ''However, it is in their music that these people express themselves, and I suppose the music is thoroughly adequate.'')

 Forty years after making ''Festival,'' Mr. Lerner drew on the same material to tease out one particular story line in ''The Other Side of the Mirror: Bob Dylan Live at the Newport Folk Festival.'' That film drew on three years' worth of Mr. Dylan's performances, including the one in 1965, in which he played an electric guitar, a development that may or may not have led the audience to boo (depending on whom you ask). But the film inarguably conveyed why Mr. Dylan mattered so much, then and now.

 ''It's a remarkably pure and powerful documentary, partly because it's so simple,'' A. O. Scott wrote in his review in The Times. ''The sound mix is crisp, the black-and-white photography is lovely, and the songs, above all, can be heard in all their earnest, enigmatic glory.''

 [Video: Bob Dylan - Live at the Newport Folk Festival Watch on YouTube.]

 Mr. Lerner also made a series of documentaries from film he shot at the Isle of Wight Festival, off the south coast of England, in 1970, a year when that event had a particularly starry lineup and drew hundreds of thousands of fans, many without tickets. Fences were stormed, and the crowd disrupted some performances.

 Mr. Lerner released ''Jimi Hendrix at the Isle of Wight'' in 1991, and the more general ''Message to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival'' in 1996. Later films focused on the performances of others at the 1970 event, among them the Who, Jethro Tull, Miles Davis and Leonard Cohen. At his death, Mr. Lerner had just completed a film about Joni Mitchell's Isle of Wight set.

 His ''Mao to Mozart'' documented the violinist Isaac Stern's trip to China in 1979, an important event in the culture thaw, taking place after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.

 Mr. Lerner is survived by his wife, the former Judith Levine, whom he married in 1961; a son, Noah; and two grandchildren.

 Throughout his career, Mr. Lerner also made films about subjects other than music, including ''To Be a Man,'' a 1966 documentary about student life at Yale, where Mr. Lerner would later teach film, and ''Magic Journeys'' (1982), a 3-D short depicting the world through the eyes of a child. It has been shown for years at Disney theme parks.

 The music documentaries, though, remain his claim to fame. In a 2011 interview Mr. Lerner was asked about his apparent knack for being at big events with a camera.

 ''I think I have a feeling for what is happening and what is going to happen, and I move towards that moment,'' he said. But he also knew that the filmmaker is not merely a passive observer.

 ''Maybe I'm being egotistical,'' he said, ''but to be honest, I'm making it that moment. I'm describing it in a way that makes it a moment.'' He added, ''I think I was using history to create an idea.''

 Making a good music documentary, he said in the same interview, meant putting something of himself into it.

 ''I'm portraying what I feel, which is different from just recording a concert,'' he said.

 ''Most people think if they just turn a camera on and the group is great, that that is what they need to do, which isn't so at all,'' he added. ''I become part of the band when I film a band.

"Qian Qichen, an imperturbable Chinese diplomat who as foreign minister and vice premier steered his country on a pragmatic course through the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and bitter quarrels with the United States, died here on Tuesday.",54182,2017-05-12 00:00:00,"BEIJING -- Qian Qichen, an imperturbable Chinese diplomat who as foreign minister and vice premier steered his country on a pragmatic course through the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union and bitter quarrels with the United States, died here on Tuesday. He was 89.

 Official Chinese news reports announced Mr. Qian's death but did not give a cause.

 Mr. Qian, whose full name is roughly pronounced chee-en chee-chen, had mostly stayed out of the public eye in recent years, but on Thursday his death was mourned on the front page of People's Daily, the Communist Party's main newspaper -- a sign of the deep imprint he made in shaping a muted, unsentimental policy after the Soviet bloc fell apart in 1991 and in chipping away at China's isolation from the West in the years after 1989.

 ''Deng Xiaoping was the architect of China's pragmatic foreign policy, but Qian Qichen was the diplomat who carried it out,'' said Susan L. Shirk, who worked with Mr. Qian when she was a deputy assistant secretary of state under President Bill Clinton and is now a professor at the University of California, San Diego.

 Mr. Qian's tough yet phlegmatic manner underwent its biggest test when the United States and other Western nations bridled with revulsion after Deng, the party's most powerful elder, ordered soldiers in June 1989 to crush pro-democracy protests that had engulfed Beijing and other Chinese cities. Hundreds of civilians died in the gunfire and the chaos on roads leading to Tiananmen Square.

 In Congress there were demands for harsh sanctions, but President George Bush, not wanting to risk a total rupture with China over the violence, sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to Beijing for talks. In their meetings, at first held in secret, Mr. Scowcroft sparred with Mr. Qian over how to improve relations.

 ''You have your difficulties, and we have ours,'' Mr. Qian told Mr. Scowcroft, according to Mr. Qian's memoirs, which were published in Chinese in 2003 and in English in 2006. ''You're looking for a solution, and we're also looking for one.''

 Mr. Scowcroft, in a talk in 2006, said that although tensions between the two nations had persisted, ''in negotiating principally with Qian Qichen, we came up with a road map to renormalize our relations.''

 Mr. Qian so won the trust of Deng and President Jiang Zemin that he was elevated to vice premier in 1993 and into the Politburo, or Political Bureau, a council of 25 senior officials, in 1998. It was a rare feat for a career diplomat, one that has not been matched by any succeeding foreign minister.

 ''The fact that he rose to become both vice premier and a Political Bureau member is a mark of the high esteem in which he was held by Chinese leaders,'' Robert L. Suettinger, a China researcher in Washington, said in an email, adding that Mr. Qian ''was able to guide Jiang Zemin and others out of international isolation after Tiananmen.''

 Mr. Suettinger was director of Asian affairs on the National Security Council under President Clinton when he met Mr. Qian, whom he described as ''always well-informed, consistently knowledgeable, never unsure of his brief.''

 Mr. Qian began his career prepared for a very different world; at the time, it seemed that China and the Soviet Union had formed an ironclad alliance and that the United States would be their perpetual foe.

 He was born on Jan. 5, 1928, in Tianjin, a northern Chinese port city, but traced his roots more than 700 miles to the south, to Jiading, now a district of Shanghai. His ancestors included a famed Qing-era scholar.

 As a student in pre-revolutionary Shanghai, Mr. Qian was drawn into underground activism for the Communist Party. He joined the party in 1942, seven years before Mao Zedong declared the creation of the People's Republic of China.

 Chinese reports about Mr. Qian's death gave few details about his background and family, although a son, Qian Ning, wrote an admiring book about the United States based on his experiences as a student at the University of Michigan.

 Mr. Qian was sent to study in the Soviet Union in 1954 after spending several years as a journalist and party operative. The next year he was given a junior post in the Chinese embassy in Moscow. There, for seven years, he watched the relationship between Beijing and the Kremlin crumble.

 Mao had looked to the Soviet Union as an ideological soul mate and source of expertise, but relations soured over doctrinal rifts and Chinese resentment of Russian dominance.

 After he returned to China in 1962, Mr. Qian continued his way up the foreign policy ladder. But like many officials he was sidelined by the anarchic Cultural Revolution that Mao unleashed in 1966. Mr. Qian was sent to a ''cadre school'' for re-educating officials before being called back into diplomatic service in 1972.

 After Mao's death, in 1976, Mr. Qian embraced a push by Deng and other leaders to open China up to the world. He was promoted to foreign minister in 1988, when China's efforts to build bridges with the West and the Soviet Union seemed to be succeeding. But in little over a year, the carnage at Tiananmen Square and the fall of the Soviet bloc threw China's diplomatic progress into doubt.

 As Communism dissolved in Eastern Europe, some Chinese officials wanted Beijing to step forward as a bolder ideological rival to the United States. But Mr. Qian supported Deng's policy of a low-profile, practical foreign policy that would allow China to focus on economic growth and core territorial issues, like the one with Taiwan. Deng called it ''biding our time and nurturing our strength.''

 Explaining that policy in 1995, Mr. Qian said: ''The only thing is to focus on doing our own tasks. No matter how international circumstances change, we must hold unwaveringly onto economic development as the focus.''

 Throughout the 1990s, Mr. Qian led China's effort to end its ostracism by the West. He helped draw Japan closer to China, opened diplomatic relations with South Korea, normalized ties with Indonesia, wooed Russia and other post-Soviet states, and looked toward improving ties with Washington.

 In 1990, seeking a compromise to end hostilities after Iraq invaded Kuwait, he visited Baghdad for talks with President Saddam Hussein, who asked him whether he thought the United States would really go to war.

 ''I told him that a great power that has assembled dozens of armies does not back away without a fight unless it had achieved its goal,'' Mr. Qian wrote in his memoirs.

 Throughout the 1990s, however, he also skirmished with American diplomats over Chinese missile sales to Pakistan, suppression of dissent in China and sanctions on trade with China. China was infuriated when, in 1995, the Clinton administration, pressed by Congress, decided to allow Lee Teng-hui, the president of Taiwan, to visit Cornell University.

 The White House described Mr. Lee's visit as a private one, but China regards Taiwan as an illegitimate breakaway province and denounced the visit as an attempt by Mr. Lee to end its diplomatic isolation. The crisis spilled into 1996, when China fired missiles near Taiwan before the island's elections.

 ''China has never committed itself to abandoning the use of force for reunification'' with Taiwan, Mr. Qian warned in an hourlong news conference.

 Mr. Qian stepped down as foreign minister in 1998 and retired from his other high posts in 2003. Unlike some retired Chinese diplomats, he did not comment publicly as his country's foreign policy grew more pugnacious in recent years, especially under President Xi Jinping.

 Mr. Qian ''never berated Western counterparts for effect, as some of his successors did,'' Professor Shirk, at the University of California, said. Unlike his weaker successors, she added, Mr. Qian also ''appeared to have the authority to make concessions, when necessary, to get agreements.''","The New York Times                                May 12, 2017 Friday                               Late Edition - Final  Qian Qichen, Pragmatic Diplomat of Post-Tiananmen China, Is Dead at 89"
"Mark White, who as governor of Texas from 1983 to 1987 championed public education laws that limited class sizes, increased teachers' pay and introduced basic skills tests for high school students, died on Saturday in Houston.",33397,2017-08-07 00:00:00,"Mark White, who as governor of Texas from 1983 to 1987 championed public education laws that limited class sizes, increased teachers' pay and introduced basic skills tests for high school students, died on Saturday in Houston. He was 77.

 Mark Miller, a longtime friend and political consultant to Mr. White, said the cause was a heart attack.

 Mr. White, a Democrat, was the attorney general of Texas from 1979 to January 1983, when he became governor after defeating William P. Clements, the Republican incumbent. (Mr. Clements returned to defeat him in 1986.)

 In his four years in office, Mr. White won legislation requiring high school students to pass basic skills tests to graduate; establishing competency tests for public-school teachers and raising their salaries; capping class sizes in elementary schools; and increasing taxes by $4 billion to finance it all. Facing an economic downturn caused by plummeting oil prices, he also tried to wean the state off its dependence on oil and lure other industries to Texas.

 ''He laid the groundwork for diversification of the Texas economy,'' President George Bush said in a statement, ''and he made significant investments in improving education in our great state.''

 Mr. White may be best known for the ''no pass, no play'' rule, part of his sweeping 1984 education bill, which required students at Texas' public schools to pass all their courses to participate in sports. The effects were significant: ''About one in every seven varsity football players has been put out of uniform for six weeks,'' The New York Times reported in 1985, ''and some schools have had to abandon junior varsity play.''

 That prompted a fierce backlash in a state where high school and college football are deeply ingrained in the culture. Mr. White received personal threats, and a legal challenge reached the Texas Supreme Court, which ultimately upheld the law.

 Mr. White defended the rule, telling state legislators at the end of his term, ''Americans didn't get to the moon on a quarterback sneak.''

 In a campaign ad in 1985, he quoted the mother of a student who had been barred from his high school football team for failing his English class: ''His father and I didn't send him to school to play. We sent him to learn. Even if he makes the team, he wouldn't be a professional ballplayer, but if he doesn't pass his classes, he'll never be a professional anything.''

 Mr. White lost his re-election campaign, in part because of ''no pass, no play'' -- but the law still stands three decades later, in a somewhat looser form.

 Even after that defeat, Mr. White told reporters he had no regrets.

 ''His focus in life was not to be a politician,'' Mr. Miller said. ''His focus in life was to make educational strides, and make an impact on the education of children and teachers in our state.''

 In a 2011 interview with The Associated Press, Mr. White said he was inspired to push his education agenda by the experience of his mother, Sarah Elizabeth White, teaching first grade. ''It was all designed around what a first-grade teacher needs,'' he said.

 Mr. Miller said one of Mr. White's proudest achievements was having an elementary school in Houston named after him.

 Mark Wells White Jr. was born on March 17, 1940, in Henderson, Tex. His father, Mark Sr., was a merchant seaman.

 He earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from Baylor University in 1962, and a law degree from Baylor Law School in 1965. He worked briefly as a lawyer in Houston before serving as an assistant state attorney general from 1966 to 1969.

 After a few years back in private law practice, he was appointed Texas secretary of state under Gov. Dolph Briscoe in 1973, and in 1979 he became the state attorney general.

 In 1990, four years after he lost his bid for re-election, he unsuccessfully challenged Ann W. Richards in the Democratic primary for governor.

 He is survived by his wife, Linda Gale White; two sons, Mark III and Andrew; a daughter, Elizabeth White Russell; a sister, Betty Gerlach; and nine grandchildren.

 In a recent interview with The Houston Chronicle, Mr. White lamented the hyperpartisanship that has come to define both state and national politics. ''It's like combat now,'' he said.

 ''But,'' he added, ''I never give up on this state, on this country. That's what you learn after being in politics as long as I have. If you give up, then you're part of the problem.''","The New York Times                               August 7, 2017 Monday                               Late Edition - Final  Mark White, 77, Texas Governor and School Booster"
"Alec McCowen, the acclaimed British character actor whose gallery of roles on both sides of the Atlantic ranged from St. Mark to the Fool in ''King Lear,'' and from Rudyard Kipling to James Bond's ever-inventive outfitter, Q, died on Monday at his home in London.",50728,2017-02-08 00:00:00,"Alec McCowen, the acclaimed British character actor whose gallery of roles on both sides of the Atlantic ranged from St. Mark to the Fool in ''King Lear,'' and from Rudyard Kipling to James Bond's ever-inventive outfitter, Q, died on Monday at his home in London. He was 91.

 A nephew, the Rev. Nigel Mumford, confirmed the death.

 Over the course of a protean half-century career in film, television and theater, Mr. McCowen's greatest triumphs were on the stage, often in classical roles. But movie audiences knew him as well.

 He was a young house master in Tony Richardson's schoolboy drama ''The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner'' (1962). In ''Travels With My Aunt'' (1972), directed by George Cukor and based on the novel by Graham Greene, he had a lead role as a bank manager with a highly eccentric aunt (Maggie Smith).

 Then there was ''Never Say Never Again'' (1983), in which Sean Connery returned to the role of James Bond after a long hiatus and Mr. McCowen played Q, always ready with new weaponry for Agent 007.

 In Alfred Hitchcock's ''Frenzy'' (1972), probably his most famous film role, he was a police inspector tracking a serial killer -- an ''assiduous sleuth whose features crumple into dismay at his wife's reckless experiments with haute cuisine,'' as the critic Michael Billington wrote in The Guardian.

 Two milestones stand out in Mr. McCowen's rich theatrical career. The first was ''Hadrian VII,'' by Peter Luke, in which he portrayed the fictional Pope Hadrian. He first played the role in London in 1968 and earned a Tony Award nomination when he played it on Broadway the next year.

 Even more significant was ''St. Mark's Gospel,'' a one-man show that proved to be successful both in London and on Broadway. As he told The New York Times in 1984, he found the prospect of a solo performance daunting but irresistible.

 ''I wanted to be an entertainer, not an actor, when I was young,'' Mr. McCowen said. ''I wanted to be Jack Benny, and I'm still dazzled, still fascinated, by the audacity of a Judy Garland or a Lena Horne or a Frank Sinatra going out there all by themselves and holding an audience's attention.''

 He had turned to the Bible as a possible source of theater in 1976, when he was searching for a challenging new stage vehicle. He found it when he began reading the Gospel According to Mark.

 ''I started learning little passages to see if it would come alive, and instantly realized it was absolutely right,'' he told The Times in 1990. ''The style had a blunt, astringent quality which suited me. And it was a Gospel of action, not teaching, one which had plenty of episodes and dwelt on none for too long.''

 He began a daily routine of memorizing the Gospel's verses, a few every day, for nearly a year and a half, and gave his first public performance in 1978. On a bare stage, in casual clothes, he brought the Gospel to life, embodying multiple characters, including Mark himself, Pontius Pilate and Jesus.

 In his 1980 memoir, ''A Double Bill,'' Mr. McCowen noted that Mark had ''constructed his Gospel with the skill of a great dramatist.''

 He performed the show in London and then in New York in 1978, where he received his second Tony nomination. He also took ''St. Mark's Gospel'' to the White House, where the audience included President Jimmy Carter. He returned the show to New York for a limited Off Broadway run in 1990.

 Writing in The New Yorker in 2010, Adam Gopnik recalled Mr. McCowen's Jesus as ''a familiar human type -- the Gandhi-Malcolm-Martin kind of charismatic leader of an oppressed people, with a character that clicks into focus as you begin to dramatize it.''

 ''He's verbally spry and even a little shifty,'' Mr. Gopnik wrote. ''He likes defiant, enigmatic paradoxes and pregnant parables that never quite close, perhaps by design.''

 Alexander Duncan McCowen was born on May 26, 1925, in Tunbridge Wells, England. He studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and worked with several repertory theaters before making his London debut in 1950 in Chekhov's ''Ivanov.'' His first movie role was in ''The Cruel Sea'' (1953), a British war film starring Jack Hawkins.

 In 1959, Mr. McCowen became a member of the Old Vic Company. Maggie Smith joined at the same time, and Judi Dench was also a member. He appeared in ''Richard II'' and ''Twelfth Night,'' among other plays, all the while feeling overshadowed by the stage pillars of an earlier generation, notably John Gielgud, Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson.

 ''They were like giants to me,'' he told the British newspaper The Independent in the early 1990s, ''not just gigantic performances, but they appeared to be actually physically larger than life. I think they cast a wicked spell on my generation, the big three, because most of us just assumed we couldn't do it too.''

 He left the Old Vic in 1961 and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962. A hallmark of his early years with the troupe was Peter Brook's celebrated production of ''King Lear,'' in which Mr. McCowen played the Fool alongside Paul Scofield in the title role. (Thirty years later, after a long absence from Shakespeare, he returned to play Prospero at Stratford-upon-Avon in a Shakespeare company production of ''The Tempest'' directed by Sam Mendes.)

 After his success with ''Hadrian VII'' -- he gave more than 500 performances -- Mr. McCowen went on to star in Christopher Hampton's play ''The Philanthropist,'' which became a runaway hit in London in 1970 but was less successful on Broadway, where it ran for only 64 performances. Nevertheless, he received another Tony nomination and won a Drama Desk Award.

 His theater credits also included the 1973 London premiere of Peter Shaffer's ''Equus,'' in which he played a psychiatrist who tries to treat a pathological young man who blinds horses, and Molire's ''The Misanthrope,'' in which he co-starred with Diana Rigg.

 In 1984, Mr. McCowen undertook another one-man show, ''Kipling,'' a collaboration with the playwright Brian Clark, which had its premiere in London and moved to Broadway later that year. He had long been fascinated with Rudyard Kipling, and in a Times interview shortly before the show's Broadway opening, he called him ''the greatest English literary entertainer since Dickens.''

 ''What I have tried to do,'' Mr. McCowen said, ''is peel away all those layers of respectability to get back to the violent, self-opinionated little boy that was always bursting out.''

 London theatergoers also saw Mr. McCowen in T. S. Eliot's ''The Cocktail Party,'' Samuel Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot'' and Brian Friel's ''Dancing at Lughnasa,'' among other plays. He returned to Broadway in 1992 in ''Someone Who'll Watch Over Me,'' Frank McGuinness's play about three hostages in Beirut (Mr. McCowen, Stephen Rea and James McDaniel) who go to extreme lengths to try to keep their sanity in close confinement.

 In addition to Father Mumford, his nephew, Mr. McCowen's survivors include a sister, Jean, as well as two nieces and another nephew. His partner, the actor Geoffrey Burridge, died from complications of AIDS in 1987. Mr. McCowen had homes in London and in Sandgate, Kent, England.

 As much as an earlier generation of great actors haunted him, Mr. McCowen told The Independent, so did his father, a shopkeeper who had never gone to college and who felt intimidated by the theater.

 ''I think I've made a journey in my life, both in private and professionally,'' Mr. McCowen said. ''Certainly I started as a young actor using the fact of being an actor to get into disguise. I was clever at disguising my voice, putting on heavy makeups and shrinking into another character.

 ''But I was very overawed by my father, and I think I was in disguise from him,'' he went on. ''I adored him, but I didn't think I was the son he wanted.

 ''He towered in my private life, rather like the image I had of the giants of the stage. I look at his photograph now and I see he was quite a little man, and I wonder what on earth all that was about.''","The New York Times                             February 8, 2017 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  Alec McCowen, British Actor, 91, Dies; Gained Fame as a Saint and the Fool"
