1980-06-24 00:00:00,22176,"UF814DALLAS, June 23 (AP) - Jesse Curry, who was the chief of police when President Kennedy was assassinated here in 1963, died last night of a heart attack. He was 66 years old.

 He collapsed at home shortly before 11 P.M. and was prounounced dead on arrival at Baylor University Medical Center. Mac McMurtry of the Dallas County Medical Examiner's office said today that the cause of death was a heart attack, adding that Mr. Curry, who was retired, had been in failing health in the last few months.

 Chief Curry and his 1,100-man force captured Lee Harvey Oswald, the accused assassin of Mr. Kennedy, within 90 minutes of the assassination in downtown Dallas Nov. 22, 1963. But two days later Jack Ruby slipped into the City Hall basement and shot Oswald fatally during a jail transfer. That shooting was seen by millions on live national television.

 Job Tensions Affected Health

 Three years later, Chief Curry resigned from the force and became chief of security for a large bank. At the time, he said that tensions of the office were affecting his health.

 ''The worst thing that ever happened to us was Jack Ruby,'' he said. ''I wake up every now and then at 2 and 3 in the morning thinking about Kennedy, Oswald and Ruby and can't go back to sleep.''

 Jack Ruby died of cancer in 1967. In Mexia, Tex., meanwhile, Justice of the Peace Opaline Bonner ruled that John Holbrook, 56, one of the 10 psychiatrists who testified at Ruby's trial for murder, died last Monday of an overdose of alcohol and Valium.

 Ruby had said that he suffered from ''psychomotor epilepsy,'' which allegedly made him insane at the time he shot Oswald, but Dr. Holbrook, testifying for the state, said that Ruby did not have that disorder.

 Mr. Curry became police chief in 1960 after working his way up through the ranks. He joined the force as a patrolman in 1936, when his salary was $89 a month. He was born in Hamilton, Tex., in 1913, the son of a policeman who became a preacher. His family later moved to Dallas.","Jesse Curry, who was the chief of police when President Kennedy was assassinated here in 1963, died last night of a heart attack.","June 24, 1980, Tuesday, Late City Final Edition  JESSE CURRY;63 DALLAS POLICE AIDE"

 Mr. Hollander, who was appointed the new nation's first director general of the Ministry of Trade and Industry in 1950, was born in Germany. He joined the family leather business at an early age, traveling on business to Europe and North and South America. He continued his business travels after settling in New York City in the 1930's.

 He held office in a number of Zionist organizations in the United States, including that of vice president of the Mizrachi Organization of America from 1940 to 1948, when he moved his family to Israel.

 He was a member of the World Zionist Actions Committee, which in May 1948 voted to proclaim Israel's independence when the British left Palestine.

 Because of his experience in international trade, Mr. Hollander was recruited for Government service and took over the trade and industry post in the Ben-Gurion Government. He was closely involved in tackling the fledgling nation's economic problems both as a Government official and as a member of Zionist committees.

He was 83 years old.

 During the Depression year of 1931, Mr. Van Dyk, as the executive director of the Hospital Council of Essex County, N.J., was acutely aware of the difficulties people had in paying their hospital bills. He began exploring the possibility of prepaid hospital care throughout the community.

 He knew of an insurance plan for schoolteachers that had been initiated in 1929 at Baylor University Hospital in Dallas, Tex., by Dr. Justin Ford Kimball, the Dallas Superintendent of Schools. Mr. Van Dyk visited Dallas to gather information and then, in 1931, he organized the Associated Hospital of Essex County, N.J. That organization, now known as the Hospital Service of New Jersey, was the first communitywide prepaid hospital care plan in the United States.

 Fannie Hurst Subscribed

 In 1935, Mr. Van Dyk started the Associated Service of Greater New York with a staff of six at 370 Lexington Avenue. Fannie Hurst, the novelist, was the first subscriber. In the first eight months the number of subscribers grew to 40,000, and on the organization's 10th anniversary it had 2 million enlisted. Today, Blue Cross and Blue Shield subscribers in the lower 17 counties of New York State total 9 million.

 Mr. Van Dyk was elected vice president in charge of enrollment in 1939, a post he held until 1961 when he was made vice president in charge of community services. He retired in 1962.

 He was a native of Paterson, N.J.

Mr. Papadopulos, who last fall was named as the nation's No. 1 sheriff by the sheriffs' association, unexpectedly lost his reelection bid in November to Robert Berens, a Republican.

 In the heated campaign, Mr. Berens repeatedly asserted that organized crime had grown in Stark County during the Papadopulos Democratic administrations. The allegations led Mr. Papadopulos to file a libel suit against Mr. Berens. Mr. Papadopulos still held the sheriffs' association presidency when he died.

 Mr. Lordi was sworn in as chairman of the commission on Sept. 6, 1977, and presided over the agency as Atlantic City casinos grew into a billion-dollar industry. He had previously been Essex County Prosecutor.

 Mr. Lordi organized the commission's 225-member staff of lawyers, auditors and other specialists. He also took the lead in interpreting the 1977 Casino Control Act, promulgating rules and regulations, conducting licensing hearings and investigating housing, transportation and other Atlantic City problems related to casinos.

 In 1980, Mr. Lordi became a focus of controversy because of an assertion made in the Abscam investigation into political corruption. Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, who was convicted in the investigation, told undercover Government agents disguised as representatives of potential Arab investors that he could - and had - influenced Mr. Lordi to help a casino company. Mr. Lordi denied the assertion and no evidence was ever offered to support it.

 Mr. Lordi retired as commission chairman on June 30, 1981. He then returned to private law practice with his brother, James, in Caldwell, N.J.

 Mr. Lordi joined the Essex County Prosecutor's office in 1959 and left in 1964 to serve as director of the state's Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. He was named County Prosecutor in 1968, serving until his appointment as gaming commission chairman. In World War II, he was a counterespionage agent for the Office of Strategic Services in Europe.

1983-05-29 00:00:00,50451,"James H.J. Tate, the Mayor of Philadelphia from 1962 to 1972, died Friday at Shore Memorial Hospital, in Somers Point, N.J., apparently of a heart attack. He was 73 years old and lived in Longport, N.J.

 The current Mayor, William J. Green, ordered city flags flown at half staff. Mr. Green said Mr. Tate had the difficult job of guiding the city in the turbulent decade of the 1960's.

 Mr. Tate took office with the support of the local Democratic organization, in contrast with his predecessor, Richardson Dilworth, who had often been at odds with the party regulars.

 Under Mr. Tate, the city experienced a construction boom. But when civil disobedience was used to demand greater representation for blacks in the construction unions, the Mayor was at first criticized by civil rights leaders for his resistance. However, Mr. Tate eventually yielded and later helped obtain passage of the city's antidiscrimination statutes.

 Mayor Helped Restore Calm

 And in the summer of 1964, after a weekend of riots when a police officer shot a black youth, the Mayor was credited with helping to restore calm.

 James Hugh Joseph Tate was born in Philadephia on April 10, 1910. He had to work his way through school, which kept him from getting his law degree from Temple University until he was 28 years old. Mr. Tate worked for a time as a law clerk for the Common Pleas Court.

 Advancing through the ranks of the local Democratic Party in the late 1930's and early 1940's, Mr. Tate served as a committeeman, ward leader and State Assemblyman. He was first elected to the City Council in 1951.

 In 1962, Mayor Dilworth resigned to run for Governor. As City Council President, Mr. Tate automatically succeeded him. In 1963, in a close vote, Mayor Tate was elected to a four-year term. In May that year demonstrators from the Congress of Racial Equality staged a sit-in at his City Hall office to protest what they said was discrimination that kept blacks off the crews for the $18 million Municipal Service Building. At the same time, members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People were picketing a school construction site making similar charges.

 Ordered Construction Stopped

 Mr. Tate finally agreed to stop construction until the contractors and unions agreed to use some black workers. In 1967 he won re-election over his Republican challenger, Arlen Specter. In 1968, Mr. Tate was elected president of the National League of Cities and in 1971 he became president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

 After leaving office in 1972, Mr. Tate divided his time between work with various political and civic organizations and educational institutions in Philadelphia. He and his wife retired to Longport in the late 1970's.

 Mr. Tate is survived by his wife, the former Anne Daly; a son, Francis, of Boston; a daughter, Anne Tate Star, of Philadelphia; a sister, Margaret Tate Callahan, of Philadelphia; two brothers, Aloysius of Hatboro, Pa., and Hugh of Glenside, Pa., and a granddaughter.","James H.J.

 Mr. Ernst was president and later chairman of the board of Bloomingdale Properties, an investment organization for members of the Bloomingdale family, from the mid-1950's to 1983. At his death, he was chairman of the company's executive committee.

 In 1959, he was a founding director of and stockholder in Atheneum Publishers. Atheneum merged with Charles Scribner's Sons in 1978 to become the Scribner Book Companies, of which Mr. Ernst was also a director. Scribner Book Companies was taken over by Macmillan Inc. this month.

 Earned Service Awards

 Mr. Ernst, a graduate of Harvard University and the Columbia University Law School, was associated with the publishing companies of Howell Soskin and Alfred A. Knopf before joining Bloomingdale Properties.

 During World War II, Mr. Ernst was promoted to captain while serving in Europe with the Ninth Infantry Regiment of the Second Army Division.

1985-04-04 00:00:00,52010,"Kelly Miller Alexander Sr., chairman of the board of directors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a veteran of the civil rights movement in his native North Carolina, died late Tuesday night at his home in Charlotte, N.C. He was 69 years old.

 Although he served less than two years as chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., the nation's oldest civil rights organization, he had been on the organization's board since 1950 and helped over the last 40 years to build the North Carolina chapter into a force in the state and the largest N.A.A.C.P. chapter in the nation.

 It was largely because of his history of devotion to the organization and its goals that the N.A.A.C.P. board turned to Mr. Alexander in 1983 after a bitter and disruptive public dispute between the chairman, Margaret Bush Wilson, and the executive director, Benjamin L. Hooks, over direction and policies. Mr. Alexander became acting chairman of the board and was considered a steadying and calming force as he reorganized the N.A.A.C.P. leadership.

 Known as 'Mr. N.A.A.C.P.'

 But it was through Mr. Alexander's field work in North Carolina, which was as slow and deliberate as his speech, that he earned the unofficial sobriquet of ''Mr. N.A.A.C.P.'' as well as the respect and ear of elected officials who once defended segregation.

 He traveled the state in the late 1940's, planting seeds for the creation of new branches of the organization, defying threats against his life and persuading fearful blacks to openly or even secretly support the group's legal and political challenges to segregation.

 Last August, in presenting Mr. Alexander the North Carolina chapter's first annual Kelly M. Alexander Humanitarian Award, James B. Hunt Jr., then-Governor of North Carolina, said that as a result of Mr. Alexander's work, blacks and whites ''together have thrown open the doors of opportunity to those who were once locked out.''

 Mr. Hooks yesterday termed Mr. Alexander a ''fearless warrior who bowed to no foe'' and one of the ''pioneers of the modern phase of the civil rights movement in the south.''

 And Judge Henry Frye, the first black to sit on the North Carolina Supreme Court, said yesterday, ''When you thought about the N.A.A.C.P. in the state you thought of Kelly Alexander because he was its driving force.''

 Kelly Miller Alexander was born Aug. 18, 1915, in Charlotte and was named by his parents for the noted black sociologist, Kelly Miller.

 Lesson In Self-Employment

 As the son of the owner of the city's only black-run funeral home, he took to heart his father's admonition that in order to fight segregation and live with dignity, one had to be self-employed. So after studying two years at Tuskegee Institute and another two years at the Renouard College of Embalming in New York City, Mr. Alexander returned to Charlotte and took over the funeral home.

 In 1940 he assumed leadership of the city's sagging N.A.A.C.P. branch and built it into a force before turning his attention in 1948 to starting other chapters in the state. As a result, there are now 27,000 members of the organization in North Carolina who annually contribute about $100,000 to the group's national coffers.

 Mr. Alexander's activities throughout the state also brought danger, and in 1965 he and his family narrowly escaped injury in the late-night bombing of his home. Speaking of this event in a 1983 interview, he said that the bombing was a surprise because he thought his efforts had eased racial tensions in the state, and even more unsettling because the bombing seemed designed ''not to frighten, but to kill.''

 But in that same interview he said: ''I not only lived through a period of segregation, but I had the pleasure of seeing it change as the N.A.A.C.P. started on its campaigns. I never turned my back on the N.A.A.C.P. even when the organization or Kelly Alexander was under attack.''

 He is survived by his wife of 39 years, Margaret, and two sons, Kelly Jr. and Alfred, all of Charlotte.","Kelly Miller Alexander Sr., chairman of the board of directors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a veteran of the civil rights movement in his native North Carolina, died late Tuesday night at his home in Charlotte, N.C.","April 4, 1985, Thursday, Late City Final Edition  KELLY ALEXANDER OF N.

 Dr. Hoffmann, professor emeritus at Queens College, had been for the last quarter century perhaps the best-known critic of multiple-choice testing.

 In his 1962 book ''The Tyranny of Testing'' and other writings, Dr. Hoffmann vehemently opposed standardized tests as superficial measures of a person's knowledge.

 His other books included ''The Strange Story of the Quantum'' (1947) and ''Albert Einstein, Creator and Rebel'' (1972).

 In 1935, Dr. Hoffmann joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., where he worked with Einstein and a Polish physicist, Leopold Infeld, on a paper, ''Gravitational Equations and the Problem of Motion.''

 Einstein, an amateur violinist, and Dr. Hoffmann, an amateur pianist, would play duets on occasion. ''They both could read pretty well and they both seemed to enjoy it, but it wasn't for anyone to hear,'' said Dr. Hoffmann's wife, the former Doris Goodday.

 Dr. Hoffmann was born Sept. 6, 1906, in Richmond, England, just outside London, the only son of Polish immigrants. He attended St. Paul's School near Richmond and Merton College, Oxford University, where he received a bachelor's degree with first-class honors in 1929.

1988-04-19 00:00:00,38923,"James E. Olson, the chairman and chief executive of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, who played a major role in reshaping the telecommunications giant after its breakup, died of cancer yesterday at his home in Short Hills, N.J. He was 62 years old.

 A.T.& T. said last week that Mr. Olson underwent surgery on March 25 to remove a malignant tumor in the colon. He returned home on April 1 and had been undergoing chemotherapy as an outpatient. He died suddenly early yesterday, the company said.

 Heir Apparent Seen

 Robert E. Allen, the A.T.& T. president who assumed control of the company last month, will continue to direct A.T.& T. until its board elects a new chairman, the company said. Mr. Allen, 53, is widely considered to be Mr. Olson's successor.

 Mr. Olson, a 44-year veteran of the Bell Telephone System, started his career cleaning dirt out of manholes and splicing cable. He is perhaps the last of a generation of A.T.& T. chairmen who have spent their professional careers with the company.

 Mr. Olson, who succeeded Charles L. Brown as chairman in September 1986, took control of A.T.& T. when the telephone company was struggling. A.T.& T., which had divested itself of the regional Bell telephone companies in 1984, had no long-term business strategy. Its expenses were out of control, and its computer division was losing about $1 billion a year.

 The new chairman turned much of that around during his 20-month tenure by emphasizing cost-cutting and such A.T.& T. core businesses as long-distance service.

 Aggressive Reduction Programs

 An operations specialist, Mr. Olson began a large cost-reduction program that brought 27,000 layoffs and a $3.2 billion write-off in the fourth quarter of 1986. He also concentrated on international expansion and revamped A.T.& T.'s flagging computer division.

 Analysts credit Mr. Olson with hiring Vittorio Cassoni, a former executive of Ing. C. Olivetti & Company of Italy to head A.T.& T.'s computer division. Mr. Cassoni has reduced A.T.& T.'s losses in its computers and bolstered its credibility through alliances with such technology heavyweights as Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View Calif.

 ''His impact was greater than his time in office,'' said Jack Grubman, a former A.T.& T. executive who now serves as a telecommunications analyst for Paine Webber Inc. ''He let everyone from the highest officers to the lowest clerks know that they were expendable if they didn't get their act together. It's unfortunate that he will not bask in the limelight that is to come from his efforts.''

 Outgoing and Energetic

 Born on Dec. 3, 1925, Mr. Olson was a short, compact man who, according to his associates, was outgoing and energetic, sometimes to the point of being forceful. He was known to shout and beat his fists on a podium or desk to emphasize a point that he believed was significant.

 ''He was an aggressive person because he had a lot of energy, but with all his aggressiveness, he still had compassion,'' said Thomas E. Bolger, the chairman of the Bell Atlantic Corporation, who worked with Mr. Olson at A.T.& T. Charles E. Hugel, a colleague of Mr. Olson's for more than 20 years at A.T.& T. before becoming the president and chief executive of Combustion Engineering Inc., said, ''People at A.T.& T. respected him and responded to his leadership and personality, and that's what it takes to be an effective executive.''

 A native of Devils Lake, N.D., James Elias Olson was the son of a barber and a school teacher. After graduating from high school in 1943, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps but had to wait until he was 18 before he could report for duty.

 'A Hot and Dirty Job'

 While waiting to begin his military service, he took a summer job with the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, later describing it as ''a hot and dirty job of going down into telephone manholes to clean out silt.'' He later served as an apprentice to a cable splicer.

 Two years after beginning his Army service, Mr. Olson entered the University of North Dakota, from he received a degree in commerce in 1950. He joined the telephone company in a management position and began to climb the corporate ladder.

 In 1972, he was named the president of the Indiana Bell Telephone Company, and in 1974, he took charge of the Illinois Bell Telephone Company, a position that had been held by two other A.T.& T. chairmen, Mr. Brown and his predecessor, John D. deButts.

 Mr. Olson became an A.T.& T. executive vice president in 1977 and was elected vice chairman in 1979. He became the chairman and chief executive of A.T.& T. Technologies in 1984 and the president and chief operating officer the following year. He was elected chairman in September 1986.

 Many Accolades

 Praise for Mr. Olson came from many telephone industry officials and executives yesterday. Dennis R. Patrick, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said that Mr. Olson was instrumental in guiding A.T.& T. through the myriad of challenges arising from its divestiture of the Bell companies and from the continuing growth of competition in the long-distance market. William McGowan, the chairman of the MCI Communications Corporation, A.T.& T.'s chief rival, called Mr. Olson ''an oustanding executive and individual who made major contributions to the industry.''

 He is survived by his wife, Jean; a son, James D., of Boston; a daughter, Julie Paterson, of Alpine, N.J.; a brother, Donald, of Santa Ana, Calif., and two sisters, Nyer, of Grand Falls, N.D., and Yona Jensen, of Minneapolis.

 A memorial service will be held at 1 P.M. on Saturday at St. Thomas Church, Fifth Avenue at 53d Street. The Olson family has requested that memorials made in the name of James E. Olson be sent to the development office of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10021.","James E.

In World War II, Mr. Titus worked for two and a half years in the Office of Strategic Services.

1991-05-27 00:00:00,51962,"Kieran E. O'Doherty, a founder and the first state chairman of the Conservative Party of New York, died on Friday at University Hospital in Salt Lake City. He was 64 years old and lived in Hampton Bays, L.I.

 He died of complications after receiving a heart transplant, a family spokesman said.

 Mr. O'Doherty and J. Daniel Mahoney, a brother-in-law, were prime movers in founding the Conservative Party in 1962. They acted primarily to challenge liberal legislation championed by Nelson A. Rockefeller, then the Republican Governor of New York.

 Mr. O'Doherty relinquished the party chairmanship to Mr. Mahoney within several months to seek a Senate seat, but received only 116,151 votes. Two years later, he got only 9,941 votes in a vain challenge to John V. Lindsay in Manhattan's 17th Congressional District. Despite these early setbacks, the Conservatives gained increasing power in the 1960's in influencing Republican politics and winning state elections.

 Practiced Law in Manhattan

 In 1966, Mr. O'Doherty was the party's candidate for lieutenant governor when it overtook the Liberal Party as the state's third party by gaining a larger vote.

 Kieran Edward O'Doherty was a native of Manhattan who served in the Army infantry in Europe in World War II. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated from the City College of New York in 1950 and from the Columbia University School of Law in 1953.

 He practiced law in Manhattan, primarily with the firm of Royall, Koegel, Harris and Caskey until 1962, when he left to establish and build the Conservative Party. In later years, he was a member of the Federal Government's Postal Rate Commission and a counsel to the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service.

 Mr. O'Doherty was a founding director of the drug-rehabilitation center Daytop Village and had, in recent years, practiced law and operated a real-estate business in Hampton Bays with his wife, the former Mary O'Boyle.

 Surviving, besides his wife, are a brother, James, of White Plains, and two sisters, Kathleen Mahoney of Milford, Conn., and Sheila Favara of North Brunswick, N.J.","Kieran E.

 Mr. Carlson was well known as the founder of the Alfred B. Nobel conference. That annual meeting has earned Gustavus Adolphus, a small Lutheran college in St. Peter, Minn., about 50 miles southwest of Minneapolis, considerable prestige by attracting prominent scientists and Nobel laureates from around the world.

 Mr. Carlson, a native of Amery, Wis., earned bachelor's degrees at Gustavus Adolphus and at Augustana Theological Seminary in Rock Island, Ill., and a master's degree at Augustana. He did doctoral work at the University of Chicago.

 He was president of Gustavus Adolphus from 1944 to 1968; founded the Minnesota Private College Council, which continues to recognize distinguished service to higher education with an award in his name, and was a member of the National Commission on the Humanities, which was instrumental in establishing the National Endowment for the Humanities.

 He died of kidney failure, said his wife, Barbara.

 In a career spanning six decades, Mr. Babbitt gave Walt Disney's Goofy his character, created the dancing mushrooms in ""Fantasia,"" gave form to the stork who announced Dumbo's arrival and enabled Fred Flintstone to sell vitamins on television.

 Mr. Babbitt was born in Omaha and began his professional career in animation in 1929 when he joined Terrytoons, Paul Terry's studio on Long Island, which created some of the earliest sound cartoons.

 Three years later he moved to California to work for the Walt Disney studio, then nine years old. He remained with Disney until 1941, when, citing union activities, the studio dismissed him.

 A strike resulted and the Cartoonists Guild became bargaining agent for the studio's workers. Disney was ordered to rehire Mr. Babbitt, who, after service in the Marines, worked there until 1947.

 Mr. Babbitt worked for several other studios, including Hanna-Barbera, where he was director of the commercial department and won more than 80 awards for his television advertisements. He also taught classes at Richard Williams Animation in London, the studio that won Oscars for the 1971 animated version of Dickens's ""Christmas Carol"" and the 1988 film ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit.""

1992-12-08 00:00:00,48310,"Richard Joseph Hughes, who reshaped New Jersey's education system as Governor and then offered a new direction for the national right-to-die debate after becoming the state's Chief Justice, died yesterday. He was 83.

 Mr. Hughes died about 2 A.M. at his vacation home in Boca Raton, Fla. He had suffered a stroke earlier this fall and died of congestive heart failure, according to a statement released by his stepson, W. Michael Murphy, the Morris County Prosecutor.

 Mr. Hughes was the only man to serve New Jersey as both Governor and Chief Justice. In his two terms as chief executive, he expanded state services for the handicapped, improved education and created the state's county college system. Beyond the state's borders, his most-lasting legacy came in a much different arena: The court that he headed handed down a landmark decision that allowed the parents of Karen Ann Quinlan to remove their comatose daughter from a respirator.

 In all his actions as a public official, Mr. Hughes focused principally on their impact upon people. Reflecting on his career, he once said, ""Speaking about the loss of tidelands didn't interest people, but talking about the loss of jelly sandwiches for kids awakened the public's concern about the need for educational funds.""

 'The Politics of Joy'

 Gov. Jim Florio issued a statement saying that Governor Hughes practiced ""the politics of joy but also of determined hard work to bring about change.""

 In an interview yesterday, former Governor Thomas H. Kean described Mr. Hughes as ""my idea of what a governor should be.""

 ""When I was Governor he would call and say, 'This is your friend, the do-gooder, again,' "" Mr. Kean said. ""He was usually calling about someone who was sick or whose pension was not being handled properly. He cared about people who did not have a lot of other people to help them.""

 Although Mr. Hughes had been active for decades in Democratic politics in New Jersey, when he became the party's candidate for governor in 1961 so little was known about him that Time magazine ran a profile titled ""Who's Hughes?""

 That question was answered in an intense, barnstorming campaign that saw Mr. Hughes make dozens of stops a day, charming groups large and small with his stories about raising a family that, within months of his inauguration, would include 10 children. The result was a 34,920-vote upset victory over James P. Mitchell, a Republican who had been Secretary of Labor in the Eisenhower Administration.

 Mr. Hughes was born Aug. 10, 1909, in Florence, a town on the Delaware River a few miles south of Trenton. His father, Richard P. Hughes, was at various times the Mayor of Burlington, a state civil service commissioner and the warden of Trenton State Prison -- where the family lived for a time.

 Mr. Hughes graduated from St. Joseph's College in Philadelphia and the New Jersey Law School, now a part of Rutgers University.

 As a young lawyer, he worked for the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930's and in the 1940's helped convert Mercer County from a Republican stronghold to a safe Democratic county.

 It was while he served as Mercer County Democratic chairman that Mr. Hughes earned the nickname ""Two Buckets."" So skilled was he at mediating disputes that it was said he could carry a bucket of water on each shoulder and never spill a drop by leaning toward either side in the controversy.

 From a job as an assistant United States Attorney for New Jersey, he moved to Mercer County Court and later to Superior Court, where he headed a study that led to revisions in the state's system for dealing with juvenile offenders. In 1957 he was appointed to the Appellate Division of Superior Court, the state's second-highest tribunal, but he soon resigned to enter private practice and support a growing family.

 Mr. Hughes married Miriam McGrory in 1935, and the couple had four children. Mrs. Hughes died in 1950. Four years later, Mr. Hughes met Elizabeth Sullivan Murphy, a widow with three children, when they were both out accompanying their children on a Halloween round of ""trick or treat."" They married in 1955 and had three children. Elizabeth Hughes died in 1983.

 In 1961, the coalition of Democratic county leaders that controlled the party picked Mr. Hughes to run for governor after their first choice, Attorney General Grover C. Richman, suffered a heart attack.

 As the centerpiece of his campaign, Mr. Hughes focused on a litany of state needs, although he deftly managed not to criticize his Democratic predecessor, Robert B. Meyner, whose personal and public frugality was legendary.

 When Mr. Hughes took office, New Jersey was one of only a handful of states that had neither an income tax nor a sales tax. His first year in office was marked by his first major political defeat when voters rejected a $750 million bond issue in November 1962.Three months later, Mr. Hughes urged enactment of a personal income tax, but legislative leaders made it clear there would be no action until after the 1965 gubernatorial election -- a race that was expected to be something of a referendum on taxation.

 The tax debate was virtually pushed out of the campaign by an unexpected issue. A Rutgers University teacher, Eugene Genovese, made headlines when he told his students he would ""welcome a North Vietnamese victory"" in the Vietnam War. The Republican candidate for governor, State Senator Wayne Dumont, called for the dismissal of Mr. Genovese, and Mr. Hughes defended the teacher's right to his opinions, although he deplored the statement.

 Tax Bill Narrowly Defeated

 After winning re-election by 350,000 votes, Mr. Hughes again turned his attention to enactment of an income tax, looking for help from the Democratic majorities in both chambers of the State House that he helped elect. His tax bill made it through the Assembly but fell one vote short in the Senate.

 In its place, he agreed to sign a bill passed by the Legislature that instituted a 3 percent sales tax, saying that to turn down any broad-based tax would relegate the state to second-class status. Although he did not know it at the time, he was to play a key role in the enactment of the income tax several years later.

 In 1973, three years after Mr. Hughes left the Governor's post, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the state's reliance on local property taxes to support public education discriminated against poorer urban districts. After Mr. Hughes was named Chief Justice by Gov. William T. Cahill in 1974, the court began prodding the Legislature to find a way to eliminate the inequities.

 After Gov. Brendan T. Byrne and the Legislature battled for months over Mr. Byrne's proposal to enact an income tax, the Hughes-led court stepped into the controversy. In June 1976, the court ordered the closing of New Jersey's public schools until a new financing plan was approved. The decision broke the back of the opposition to the income tax. It was enacted and the schools were reopened.

 Earlier that year the court made history on a very different issue: the proper role of medical technology in the preservation of life and health, an issue often described as ""the right to die."" In a landmark opinion in the case of Karen Ann Quinlan, the seven-member court unanimously asserted an individual's right to refuse medical treatment and a guardian's power to exercise that right in the event the patient is too ill to make his or her wishes known.

 Right to Privacy

 In an opinion written by Mr. Hughes, the court grounded its decision in a constitutional right to privacy and held that as the medical techniques designed to prolong life become more invasive, the state's interest in preserving life declines and the patient's right to privacy grows.

 The decision was followed by other similar rulings, in New Jersey and across the country, that affirmed an individual's right to control the extent of medical treatment in the face of expanding medical technology.

 In 1982, three years after he left the bench, Mr. Hughes attended a ceremony naming the state's new $93 million Justice Complex after him. Characteristically, he had tried to deflect the honor by lobbying for a predecessor, Woodrow Wilson. He said the former Governor and President was a man ""who stood for international peace through law, something the world needs today."" It was one of the few times he was overruled.

 Besides his stepson Mr. Murphy, of Chatham, N.J., Mr. Hughes is survived by five sons: Richard J., of Palm Coast, Fla.; Robert F., of Parsippany, N.J.; John J., of Trenton; Brian, of Princeton, N.J.; and Thomas M., of South Orange, N.J.; two daughters, Mary, of Boca Raton, Fla., and Helen Calero of Lawrenceville, N.J.; two other stepsons, Timothy J.

1992-10-20 00:00:00,16061,"Howard W. Lipman, an art collector and a former chairman of the Whitney Museum of American Art, died on Sunday at his home in Carefree, Ariz., his son announced yesterday. He was 87 years old.

 Mr. Lipman had a series of small strokes in recent months and was generally in declining health, said his son, Dr. Peter Lipman, a geologist.

 Mr. Lipman, a former managing partner of Neuberger & Berman, a Manhattan-based securities firm, was a trustee of the Whitney from 1968 until his death. He was its chairman from 1977 to 1985 and served as its unpaid president from 1974 to 1977.

 On Donating Works

 He was also an important donor of art to the Whitney. In 1980 in The New York Times, Hilton Kramer reviewed the museum's show ""American Sculpture: Gifts of Howard and Jean Lipman"" and wrote: ""Few collectors of contemporary American art have shown an enthusiasm greater than that of Howard and Jean Lipman when it came to acquiring works of modernist sculpture.

 ""Almost nothing, it often seemed, has been too 'difficult' or audacious for them to embrace with their customary equanimity, and this is all the more remarkable when we recall that in the years that Mr. and Mrs. Lipman have been energetically acquiring new sculpture -- roughly, the last quarter-century -- this medium has undergone some very radical changes indeed. The Lipmans have been especially drawn to them.""

 The Lipmans' gifts included works by Jasper Johns, Alexander Calder, Robert Morris and Robert Smithson.

 Collection of Folk Art

 In four decades, Mr. and Mrs. Lipman built up a collection of folk art. They sold part of it for $1 million in 1981 to the Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan. The museum kept 32 works and sold the remaining 413 works at auction that year for a total of $911,000. Other works of folk art the Lipmans collected went to the New York State Historical Association at Cooperstown, N.Y.

 Jean Lipman was the editor of the magazine Art in America from 1940 to 1970 and was later in charge of the museum's publications. She also became known for her own writing, especially on folk art, and for her own painting.

 In addition to his son, of Portola Valley, Calif., and his wife, Mr. Lipman is survived by two grandsons.","Howard W.

1993-01-01 00:00:00,7397,"The Rev. Timothy S. Healy, a Jesuit priest who straddled the religious and secular life in a career that included the presidency of Georgetown University and finally leadership of the New York Public Library, died on Wednesday night after he collapsed at Newark International Airport. He was 69.

 Father Healy was returning from a vacation in Scottsdale, Ariz., when he was stricken. He was taken to Elizabeth General Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 11:21 P.M. His death was caused by a heart attack, said Nancy Donner, a spokeswoman for the library.

 In a career that spanned almost 50 years, Father Healy had also been vice chancellor of the City University of New York for academic affairs.

 In 1969, when he accepted the City University post, he found it necessary to explain that he was not controlled by his Jesuit superiors.

 ""I am not under discipline to anyone,"" he said at the time. ""I am a priest and as long as I behave myself, I am free to do as I please.""

 His appointment to the library presidency in 1988 evoked criticism from some writers who questioned whether a Roman Catholic priest, with his commitment to papal authority, could still uphold the tenets of free speech. Father Healy dismissed the chance of such a conflict arising, but vowed to resign if one did.

 In an interview three months ago, it was evident that the earlier criticism still rankled. ""Anti-Catholicism is the one allowable bigotry,"" he said.

 Told of Father Healy's death, President-elect Bill Clinton, a longtime friend, characterized the priest as ""the epitome of the merging of faith and intellect, a walking demonstration that there need be no conflict between the two.""

 A graduate of Georgetown and a Rhodes Scholar, Mr. Clinton maintained close ties with Father Healy and, at his request, often met with and counseled the school's Rhodes Scholar nominees.

 A native New Yorker who once had a summer job reshelving books at the main library on Fifth Avenue, Timothy Stafford Healy came from Georgetown to succeed Vartan Gregorian as library president when Dr. Gregorian resigned to become the president of Brown University. He had been widely credited -- by Father Healy, among others -- with bringing the library from near-destitution to robust institutional health during his eight-year tenure.

 'A Place of Learning'

 Like Dr. Gregorian, Father Healy came to the New York Public Library from an academic background. The switch made sense, he once said, because ""a university is a place of teaching and a library is a place of learning.""

 ""I grew up in libraries,"" he once told an interviewer. ""I care for them. I understand how they work.""

 A man of considerable scholarship -- he received his doctorate from Oxford for his work on the poetry of John Donne -- he was brought to the library more for his fund-raising and lobbying skills. During his 13 years as Georgetown's president he increased the school's endowment from $38 million to nearly $228 million. A five-year fund-raising effort that ended in 1989 raised $178 million, $63 million over the goal.

 He followed the same course at the Public Library. ""The endowment was $170 million when I got here,"" he said last September. ""It's $220 million now. I'd love to see it at $300 million or $400 million.""

 As president of the New York Public Library, Father Healy was in charge of a system consisting of four research centers, which are owned and operated by a private foundation that must raise money to support them, and 82 branches, which are owned by the city and the state and operated under a city contract.

 Father Healy's enthusiasm for the library was informed by his own life in the city. He recalled his years at the City University with fondness. ""Those were heady days,"" he said shortly before his death, ""more fun than a barrel of monkeys. We tackled a lot of problems. We didn't solve them all, but we helped a lot of kids.""

 Born in Manhattan

 Father Healy was born in Manhattan on April 25, 1923. His father, Reginald Stafford Healy, an Australian, came to the United States and Texas to study petroleum engineering after fighting in World War I. ""I belong to all the Irish societies,"" Father Healy once said, ""but I'm not Irish. I am probably the linear descendant of an 18th-century sheep thief.""

 His mother, Margaret Vaeth Healy, was a schoolteacher in Gainesville, Tex. The family moved to New York, where the elder Healy ran the business side of a small oil company. After the business collapsed in 1929, he took various jobs, his son later recalled, including conducting a children's radio program called ""Captain Tim's Stamp Club of the Air"" on NBC.

 Timothy Healy joined the Society of Jesus after graduating from Regis High School, a Jesuit school in Manhattan, in 1940. ""At first, my parents weren't too enthused about my becoming a priest,"" he once recalled. ""They even bought me a car to test my resolve.""

 He earned degrees in English literature and philosophy at a Jesuit seminary in Woodstock, Md., studied theology at the University of Louvain in Belgium and at the University of Valencia in Spain.

 Ordained in 1953

 He taught English for several years at Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx and was ordained a priest in 1953. He earned a master's degree in English literature at Fordham University in 1953 and his doctorate from Oxford in 1965.

 It was at Fordham, like Georgetown a Jesuit institution, that he first impressed his superiors as a potential administrator. He rose through the ranks, becoming executive vice president before he was tapped for the job as vice chancellor of the City University. Father Healy arrived at CUNY in the midst of a controversy over open enrollment, the plan that guaranteed all city high school graduates a place in the university system, regardless of their grades.

 By the time Father Healy left the City University in 1976, minority enrollment had jumped from 5 percent to 30 percent. ""It was so simple at CUNY,"" he later told Time magazine. ""There were no agendas, no politicking. Your task was clear: educate the poor. And that's what we did.""

 Extended His Influence

 At Georgetown, Father Healy extended his influence into Washington's uppermost political and social arenas. He was criticized by the right for working to develop academic exchanges with Communist China and for equating the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority with the Ku Klux Klan. The left complained when he hired Jeane Kirkpatrick and Henry Kissinger.

 He was criticized for accepting funds from the Government of Libya to endow a chair in Arab studies and was called a ""Jesuit Zionist"" by a history professor close to the Palestine Liberation Organization when he returned some of the money to Libya.

 On moral issues he could be conservative. He incurred the enmity of gay students when he refused to grant official recognition and a subsidy to their campus organization and he forced the editors of a student newspaper to drop an ad from an abortion referral service. Eventually, the gay students won a discrimination suit and got their recognition.

 After returning to New York to take the post at the library, he went frequently to Washington to urge the Government to take a larger role in supporting the library -- and all libraries. He lobbied Congress to finance a variety of projects included closer liaison with the neglected libraries of Eastern Europe.

 In New York, as in Washington, Father Healy led a divided life. He wore civilian clothes, just as he had done during his years at CUNY, with the occasional addition of some eccentric suspenders, a gift from the designer Bill Blass. He said Mass daily and lived not in the comfortable, three-bedroom apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side provided by the library, but in a smaller hideaway in midtown. Often he stayed at America House, a Jesuit residence at 106 West 56th Street in Manhattan.

 A heavyset man in his later years -- he admitted to being 50 pounds overweight -- Father Healy exuded the energy and bonhomie of a successful corporate executive. He swam almost daily but, in spite of many resolutions, never managed to give up smoking. He had heart surgery in 1983.

 He talked vaguely of retiring in two or three years but was filled with ideas that could have taken him beyond that period. He was particularly concerned about the library's branches. 'I want to see the library serve the poor better,"" he said last September. ""We have this unique outreach. We have 40 branches in neighborhoods where junkies shoot up on the front steps while little kids run in and out with armfuls of books. We can reach that population. We've got to.""

 A Humorous Nature

 Humor was an integral part of Father Healy's nature. While he insisted there were no moral or philosophical impediments to his running the library, he once acknowledged that there were limits to what a priest could do. ""I'd have great difficulty running a racetrack parlor and being a Jesuit,"" he said.

 Once during his years at vice chancellor at CUNY, a group of classics professors complained that recent budget cuts had demonstrated an insensitivity to their particular discipline. He took it upon himself to reply to them by telegram -- in Latin.

 Father Healy's roles in the religious and secular world often made new acquaintances uneasy; they didn't know what to call him. With students and most laymen he was simply Father Healy. At the library he was known as Dr. Healy. In personal encounters he solved the problem by jutting a hand out before anyone else spoke, smiling and saying: ""Tim Healy.""

 He talked about getting back to scholarship. In fact, he had never left. He taught a course at Georgetown; this past term he gave a class in the poetry of John Donne and Gerard Manley Hopkins at CUNY. And always he read Virgil -- in Latin. ""Virgil,"" he once said, ""is the best anger-reducer there is.""

 He is survived by two sisters, Mary Dean Dumais of New York City and Dr. Peggy Beauvois of Knoxville, Tenn., and a brother, David Healy of London.

 A wake will be held at America House tomorrow and Monday from 2 to 5 P.M. and from 7 to 9 P.M.

 Mrs. Logan was an associate of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a campaign aide for several political figures, including Nelson A. Rockefeller, Robert F. Kennedy and Robert F. Wagner.

 Mayor Abraham D. Beame appointed Mrs. Logan to head the Commission on Human Rights in 1977. During her two-year tenure she worked to stop the practice of redlining, by which banks and savings and loan institutions refuse to make mortgage loans to residents of certain areas.

 Efforts on West Side

 Along with her husband, Dr. Arthur C. Logan, a surgeon, she was involved in efforts to stabilize the West Side as an integrated community during urban-renewal efforts there.

 Mrs. Logan was a socially prominent fund-raiser who generated financial backing for both national and local civil-rights issues and causes, particularly those of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

 Mrs. Logan was at one time the only Northern board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She also raised money for the Congress of Racial Equality and the Urban League.

 In 1971 the Citizens Union presented Dr. and Mrs. Logan with awards for outstanding public service for their prominence in campaigning for civil rights and better public health.

 During her career in show business she sang using the stage name Marian Bruce. In the 1940's and 1950's she starred in the first all-black show to be presented in a Miami Beach nightclub. She also sang in Europe.

 Mrs. Logan's husband died previously.

1994-07-21 00:00:00,33923,"E. Frederic Morrow, a retired banker, author and executive assistant to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 88 and lived in Manhattan.

 The cause was complications from a stroke, his family said.

 Mr. Morrow was the first black to reach an executive position at the White House and the first black vice president at the Bank of America, then the world's largest privately owned bank.

 As described in his writings, he traversed a ""jungle of racial barriers"" to get there.

 The son of a Methodist minister, Everett Frederic Morrow was born in Hackensack, N.J., and earned his bachelor and Doctor of Laws degrees at Rutgers University.

 In Commerce Department

 Before World War II, he was a field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He joined the United States Army Field Artillery as a private in 1942 and left as a major in 1946.

 After the war, he was a public-affairs writer for the Columbia Broadcasting System. In 1952, he boarded General Eisenhower's Presidential campaign train as a personal adviser and administrative assistant.

 He was an executive in the Commerce Department in 1955 when the President appointed him Administrative Officer for Special Projects. That made him the first black to serve as a Presidential Executive Assistant. He also worked as a speechwriter.

 Mr. Morrow publicly urged the White House and the Republican Party to champion racial integration and equal rights all the way down to the district level, and to respond to black pressure for first-class citizenship. He held that the party's failure to do so was responsible for its ""ignominious defeat"" in the Congressional elections in 1958, and he called on its leadership to do some ""soul-searching.""

 How he himself was engulfed by questions of race and color was evident in ""Black Man in the White House"" (1963), his account of the Eisenhower years and the social and professional snubs he encountered. A review in The New York Times said the book made the reader squirm and must have caused many party leaders to wish he had kept his diary ""personal and private.""

 Leaving the White House in 1960, Mr. Morrow scouted the private sector but instead became a vice president of the African-American Institute in New York. ""It still shocks many captains of industry,"" he said at the time, ""when a Negro seeks a job on the executive level even though he dealt with them directly as part of his official White House assignment.""

 The Bank of America made him an assistant vice president at its international subsidiary on Wall Street in 1964. His responsibilities included foreign loans and business development, and he retired as a senior vice president in 1975. After that he worked as an executive associate at the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J.

 He is survived by his wife of 37 years, Catherine Gordon Morrow; a sister, Nellie Parker of Baltimore, and a brother, Dr. John H. Morrow of Huntington Beach, Calif.","E.

1994-01-15 00:00:00,41916,"Samuel Bronston, a Hollywood film producer whose credits include the historical epics ""El Cid,"" ""King of Kings"" and ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" died on Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Sacramento, Calif. He was 85.

 The cause was pneumonia secondary to Alzheimer's disease, said his daughter Irene Bronston.

 Over a period of about 25 years Mr. Bronston either produced or had a role in producing about a dozen films. Perhaps his most famous production was ""El Cid,"" a 1961 epic about the Spanish hero, which starred Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren. The three-hour film received mixed reviews, but it won Mr. Bronston several awards.

 Mr. Bronston was born in Russia and brought up in France, where he first became interested in photography and film production. He moved to the United States in 1937 at the age of 29.

 Among the other films in which he was involved were ""The Adventures of Martin Eden"" (1942), ""Jack London"" (1943), ""City Without Men"" (1943), ""And Then There Were None"" (1945), ""Walk in the Sun"" (1945), ""John Paul Jones"" (1959), ""55 Days at Peking"" (1963) and ""Circus World"" (1964).

 He then made several documentaries.

 In the late 1940's, Mr. Bronston became the official photographer of the Vatican and produced several films on behalf of the Chancellery of the Vatican. He retired in 1985.

 Mr. Bronston's marriage ended in divorce.

 In addition to his daughter Irene, of Berkeley, Calif., he is survived by two sons, Dr. William Bronston of Sacramento and Philip Bronston of San Antonio; two other daughters, Andrea Bronston of Madrid and Kira Bronston of Austin, Tex., and 10 grandchildren.","Samuel Bronston, a Hollywood film producer whose credits include the historical epics ""El Cid,"" ""King of Kings"" and ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" died on Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Sacramento, Calif.","January 15, 1994, Saturday, Late Edition - Final  Samuel Bronston, Film Producer, 85; Made Epic 'El Cid'"
1994-05-28 00:00:00,13222,"George W. Ball, who as Under Secretary of State in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations argued forcefully but unsuccessfully against United States involvement in the Vietnam War, died Thursday night in New York Hospital. He was 84 years old and lived in Princeton, N.J.

 The cause of death was not immediately determined, but his son, Douglas, said that Mr. Ball had entered the hospital on Wednesday and that his doctors had made a diagnosis of terminal abdominal cancer.

 Mr. Ball's opposition to the Vietnam War was based on his belief that Europe, not Southeast Asia, was the central political arena and that the key to East-West rapprochement and world peace lay in a strong, unified Western Europe.

 Mr. Ball, who also served as United States delegate to the United Nations in 1968, retired in 1982 as senior managing director of the New York investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb.

 Career Began in New Deal

 In a career that began in the New Deal and spanned half a century, Mr. Ball was a lawyer, economist, author, investment banker, high Government official, diplomatic troubleshooter and adviser to Presidents. He never ran for elective office and rose no higher than Under Secretary, the No. 2 post in the State Department, which he held from 1961 to 1966. But he was an influential and often dissenting voice in the making of American foreign policy in the 1960's.

 Mr. Ball was a leading exponent of European economic and political unity and of aid to underdeveloped nations; a mediator of crises in Cyprus, Pakistan, the Congo and elsewhere and a member of President Kennedy's inner circle in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.

 But he was perhaps best known as an early and consistent opponent of American involvement in Vietnam: a devil's advocate who challenged the basic assumptions about the war, yet never lost his influence within the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations.

 As early as 1961, when most Americans had no inkling of where Vietnam was, let alone what was going on there, Mr. Ball was urging President Kennedy not to send American servicemen, warning that hundreds of thousands of troops might ultimately have to go.

 The Vietnamese Detour

 Later, when the Johnson Administration built up American involvement in the war, he argued against ""the Vietnamese detour with its deep ruts and treacherous quicksands."" Later on, he did not favor unilateral American withdrawal, but sought reduced involvement and a political settlement with the Communists.

 ""By a series of small steps, taken in good faith over a period of years,"" he said as the conflict swelled, ""we have mired ourselves in a frustrating war that turns our otherwise sensible countrymen into placard-carrying hysterics and impedes our coming to grips with fundamental problems in our cities, our society and the world.""

 His opposition was not founded on pacifism, morality or other principles espoused by antiwar demonstrators. Indeed, he found it ""stupid and unattractive"" that antiwar protesters engaged ""in self-flagellation, declaring in sanctimonious tones that American policy is thoroughly in the wrong and that we as a nation are as brutal and viciously ambitious as the other side.""

 His dissenting views stemmed rather from his belief that Southeast Asia was peripheral to American interests, diverting attention from the main arena, which he said lay in Europe.

 Focus on Europe

 This theme -- that a united Western Europe was the key to American foreign policy because it would strengthen the Atlantic alliance and provide a cushion between the United States and the Soviet Union -- was, in fact, the touchstone of Mr. Ball's vision of global politics.

 In this vision, the United States, a unified Europe and the Soviet Union would come finally to an East-West rapprochement, and these stronger nations of the northern half of the world, working together, would help the poorer peoples of the Southern Hemisphere, ultimately bringing peace and plenty to the planet.

 With Europe and its problems as his immediate focus, Mr. Ball thus concluded that the whole Asian mainland, not merely Vietnam, was peripheral to American interests and that fighting there constituted an enormous waste of human and national resources.

 Communist China, he contended, was overrated as a menace, and its existence should be accepted forthrightly. He favored trade with China, United Nations membership for Beijing and abandonment of the ""myth"" that Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan represented China.

 Views Did Not Prevail

 Mr. Ball's views, for the most part, did not prevail while he was in office, though by the end of the Johnson years many top policy makers believed, as he had, that the Vietnam War could not be won. For most of his tenure, however, Mr. Ball was regarded in the Government as a kind of loyal oppositon.

 ""I've become,"" as he once said, ""a champion of lost causes.""

 Detractors contended he was being used by Secretary of State Dean Rusk and President Johnson as a sophisticated yes man who could be relied upon to raise cogent objections and then be overruled, so critics could not say dissenting views were unheard in policy-making circles. But Mr. Ball's admirers called him a team player in the best sense and said his views were valued and had a moderating influence.

 When he resigned as Under Secretary in 1966 to return to private life, Mr. Ball left on friendly terms and silenced his criticism of the war during the remaining Johnson years. It was not until after President Nixon took office that he attacked America's Vietnam policy publicly again.

 He was called back several times in the Johnson Administration, serving on a Presidential advisory group that urged an end to a further buildup of the Vietnam War and providing counsel when North Korea captured an American intelligence ship, the Pueblo, in January 1968.

 Author and Counsel

 In May 1968, President Johnson named Mr. Ball as the United States delegate to the United Nations after Arthur J. Goldberg, another opponent of the Vietnam War, resigned, apparently in frustration over his diminishing influence.

 Mr. Ball returned to work as an investment banker when President Nixon entered the White House in 1969, but was called back by President Carter for counsel on crises in Iran and the Persian Gulf and on the Panama Canal Treaties. He also continued to write articles and books, occasionally stirring controversy with his views on Israel, the Middle East and other subjects.

 Mr. Ball was the author of five books, ""The Discipline of Power: Essentials of a Modern World Structure,"" published in 1968; ""Diplomacy for a Crowded World,"" in 1976; ""The Past Has Another Pattern,"" a memoir, in 1982; ""Error and Betrayal in Lebanon,"" in 1983, and ""The Passionate Attachment,"" a history of American-Israeli relations, written with his son, Douglas, in 1992. At his death, he was working on a book about America at the end of the 20th Century.

 Tall, burly, with white wavy hair, a cleft chin and gray eyes behind dark- rimmed spectacles, Mr. Ball was a forceful speaker whose style, in writing too, struck an academic tone with literary flourishes. His sentences often began ponderously but wound up with stingers in the tail. In a memo to President Kennedy, for example, he wrote: ""Whenever we extend the hand of friendship to President de Gaulle, he puts into it a dead fish.""

 Native of Iowa

 George Wildman Ball was born on Dec. 21, 1909, in Des Moines, the third son of Amos and Edna Wildman Ball. His mother was a teacher and his father was a Scottish immigrant who became a vice president of Standard Oil of Indiana.

 The family moved to Evanston, Ill., when George was 11, and he later enrolled at Northwestern University. He majored in English, founded a literary magazine, graduated in 1930 and earned his law degree from Northwestern in 1933.

 Eager to become a part of the New Deal, he went to Washington and worked in the Farm Credit Bureau and in the Treasury Department. But his enthusiasm soon paled and he returned to Chicago in 1935 to join a tax law firm, one of whose partners was Adlai E. Stevenson. The two became close friends, and Mr. Stevenson, who went to Washington in 1941, helped place Mr. Ball in 1942 as a lawyer with the Lend-Lease Administration.

 In London in 1944-45, Mr. Ball was director of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, appraising the effects of the air war against Germany. It was in this capacity that he met and became close to Jean Monnet, who was to become known after the war as the architect of the European unification movement.

 Captivated by Mr. Monnet's vision of Europe as a unified political-economic entity that could be a bulwark of Western strength, Mr. Ball after the war supported the unification cause, in effect becoming its Washington representative.

 Lobbied for Common Market

 He became a founding partner of the law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Ball, which represented the Common Market and the European Coal and Steel Community, and he pushed the first abortive efforts of British entry into the Common Market.

 It was a short step into the political arena after Mr. Stevenson, then Governor of Illinois, joined the race for President in 1952. Then, and again in 1956, Mr. Ball was chief of volunteers in the Stevenson Presidential campaigns. In 1960, he backed John F. Kennedy.

 When the Kennedy Administration took office, Mr. Ball was named Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. But less than a year later, when Chester Bowles resigned in November 1961, Mr. Ball was named Under Secretary of State.

 Mr. Ball became an Administration trouble-shooter, shuttling between Athens, Ankara and Nicosia to mediate crises over Cyprus, and dashing off to Pakistan, the Congo, the Dominican Republic and other trouble spots to ease tensions or halt fighting. He was a prodigious toiler and traveler, often working six days a week and 70 hours at a stretch, and was usually at his best under pressure.

 In Kennedy's Inner Circle

 He was one of a small circle of advisers to President Kennedy in the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, when the discovery that Soviet missiles were being transported and installed in Cuba raised the specter of nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Mr. Ball urged a naval blockade of Cuba coupled with a demand that the Soviet missiles be withdrawn, the course that was successfully followed.

 After Mr. Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, Mr. Ball was one of the leaders who went to the White House to work out a transition to the new Administration. Resigning as Under Secretary in 1966, he joined Lehman Brothers and, except for his service at the United Nations and occasional duty as a Presidential adviser, remained with the firm for the rest of his career.

 In the Carter Administration, Mr. Ball helped draft long-range American policy in the Persian Gulf. As an adviser to the National Security Council on Iran, he was critical of supporting Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, and favored formation of a broad coalition government in Teheran. He also helped mount a bipartisan effort for Senate ratification of the Panama Canal Treaties.

 Mr. Ball's wife, Ruth Murdoch Ball, whom he married in 1932, died last August. He is survived by two sons, John Colin Ball, of West Concord, Mass., and Douglas Bleakly Ball, of Rockville Centre, L.I., and two grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York on June 21.","George W.

He joined the Royal Air Force in 1924 as an instructor at its Central Flying School, returned to civilian life as a test pilot and won trophies for aerobatics and cross-Channel air races.

 In World War II, he rejoined the Central Flying School but the R.A.F. sent him to the United States to test the warplanes being sent to Britain on Lend-Lease. He became chief of the test branch of the British Air Commission in this country in 1943, rose to the rank of group captain and received the Air Force Cross.

 After the war he served as civil-aviation attache in the British Embassy in Washington until 1952. That year he became United States representative of Vickers-Armstrong Ltd., then one of Britain's leading aircaft and arms manufacturers. That led to his position in 1961 as head of British Aircraft Corporation U.S.A., now British Aerospace. He retired four years later.

1995-09-27 00:00:00,51563,"Anyone attending the inauguration this weekend of Ruth Simmons as Smith College's ninth president will be likely to note the presence of such luminaries as Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning author; Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman College; Cornel West, the scholar, and Henry Louis Gates, the writer and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard.

 But they might miss the people who Ruth Simmons believes are the most important -- those responsible for her becoming the first black president of one of the country's most elite women's colleges. They are her nine brothers and sisters: Elbert, Wilford, Atherine, Albert, Arnold, Nora, Clarence, Ozella and Azella. Her eighth-grade teacher, Modria Caraway. Her high school drama teacher, Vernell Lillie.

 Her kindergarten teacher, Ida Mae Henderson, would like to be there, but at age 85, she is not strong enough to make the trip alone from Grapeland, Tex. ""Miss Ida Mae,"" Dr. Simmons said. ""I revere her.""

 Dr. Simmons, who is 50, is the great-great-granddaughter of slaves. She began her journey on a cotton farm in Grapeland, in East Texas. Her parents, the late Isaac and Fannie Stubblefield, were sharecroppers. Dr. Simmons was the youngest of 12 children -- two brothers are dead -- and was 7 when the family moved to a poor section of Houston. Her father went to work in a factory and eventually became pastor of the Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church. Her mother scrubbed floors for white families.

 To Henry Louis Gates, the appointment of a black woman to the top job at Smith is ""a major event in the history of American letters."" Professor Gates, who regards Dr. Simmons as a mentor, said, ""She's the Jackie Robinson of college presidents.""

 Ask Ruth Simmons how she did it, how she made her way from Grapeland to the provost's job at Spelman College to vice provost at Princeton University to the presidency of Smith, and she seems startled by the question. ""I didn't make it happen,"" she said in an interview the other day in her wood-paneled office at Smith. ""That's just the point.""

 It was her teachers at the segregated schools she attended, W. R. Banks Elementary in Grapeland and Phyllis Wheatley High in Houston, who made it happen, she said. ""They thought I belonged in college,"" she said. ""And they were convinced they would get me there. They protected me, especially after my mother died.""

 She was 15 when her mother lost her battle with kidney disease. ""I had a remarkable mother,"" said Dr. Simmons, who is 50. ""When she would do day's work, she would sometimes take me with her to white people's houses when I was a little girl. The thing I remember vividly is how good she was at what she did. She was very demanding in terms of her own work -- Do it well, do it thoroughly, whatever you do.""

 After graduation from high school, she went to Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, where she majored in Romance languages.

 ""Vernell Lillie wrote to Dillard, which is where she had gone, and asked them to provide a scholarship for me,"" Dr. Simmons said.

 Ms. Lillie, a professor of African studies at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview: ""She was brilliant. I was very fortunate to be a part of her life.""

 The scholarship did not cover everything. ""I didn't have enough money to buy clothes,"" said Dr. Simmons, who was elegantly dressed the other morning in a long, dark-green pleated skirt and matching jacket, with a double strand of pearls and small gold hoop earrings. ""And I'll never forget one of my teachers asked me to come over to her house, and she went to her closet and she took enough clothes out for me to go to college.""

 Her family pitched in, too. ""My brothers and sisters would send me what they could,"" she said. ""They were all starting families. Sometimes it would be $5, or $10.""

 Her brother Wilford Stubblefield, who is 16 years older, was working at an oil refinery in Houston as a janitor, the only job open to a black man at the refinery in those days.

 ""We all helped her -- probably not as much as we should have,"" Wilford said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Houston. ""She was the second one that had gone off to college. Naturally, we were proud.""

 Another brother, Clarence Stubblefield, who is 54 and a high school basketball coach in Houston, had gone to Prairie View College in Texas on a basketball scholarship.

 Dr. Simmons said: ""I'm not the brightest person in my family. I was very lucky. I came along at the right time.""

 Growing up in the segregated South, she said, she had no specific ambition, only a hunger to learn. ""One really didn't aspire to do professional things,"" she said. ""I think my mother must have thought that eventually perhaps I would get enough education to be self-sustaining and to do something comfortable, perhaps housework.""

 Instead, she earned an undergraduate degree from Dillard, and master's and doctorate degrees in Romance languages at Harvard. She became an assistant professor of French, and later an assistant dean at the University of New Orleans.

 In the meantime, at age 22, she married Norbert Simmons, a lawyer and businessman. They had a son, Khari, now 22 and a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and a daughter, Maya, 18, who plans to attend Spelman next year.

 After the couple separated in the mid-1980's -- they were divorced in 1989 -- Dr. Simmons began her administrative rise at Princeton. She brought Ms. Morrison and Professor West to the Princeton faculty. She tried to persuade Professor Gates to join the faculty, too, he said.

 There was one problem with Ms. Morrison's appointment: the faculty search committee wanted a resume. And Ms. Morrison, offended by the request, refused to submit one.

 So Ruth Simmons wrote Toni Morrison's resume for her. ""Here's my philosophy about life,"" said Dr. Simmons, who considers Ms. Morrison her best friend. ""Don't dwell on insignificant things.""

 Ms. Morrison said in a telephone interview: ""She's still a bit of a miracle as far as I'm concerned. She has an unusual combination of real politics and integrity, and this very keen sense of morals which does not interfere with her generosity and her wide spiritedness. She's extremely creative in terms of solving other people's problems. And she's a lot of fun.""

 For the 14-member presidential search committee at Smith, Dr. Simmons was the unanimous first choice. ""We had a wish list of the qualities we wanted,"" said one member of the committee, Peter Rose, a sociology professor. ""She seemed to fill them all. Race was not an issue.""

 Of Smith's 2,800 students, 86 are black. There are 15 black faculty members -- out of 300.

 One goals, Dr. Simmons said, is to interest more black women in Smith. She hopes her presence will help. ""If it's not a good place for African-American students,"" she said, ""it's not a good place for me.""

 Her friend, Professor Gates, said he was already planning ahead. ""I'm hoping Maggie and Liza Gates will go to Smith now,"" he said, referring to his teen-age daughters. ""It never would have occurred to me before Ruth became president.""

 For now, her presence has electrified the campus. She walks everywhere. She invites students into her office to talk. She listens to them, they say.

 Tigress Osborne, a black senior, said she returned to Smith last spring after taking some time off. ""One of my friends said, 'You won't believe what's happened: we have a black president!' "" Ms. Osborne said. ""There's a moment when you think if Smith picked a black woman, how black is she? Is she going to be interested in us?""

 She added, ""But there's a real sense of her blackness. She also has a good handle on how to be not just the black president, on how not to cater to just black students.""

 Watching Dr. Simmons mingle at the senior tea last week, one senior, Kathryn Fields, who is white, said: ""She's so cool. She's so young. She's new, she's exciting, she's going to make this school amazing.""

 At her inauguration, the new president will be carrying a Bible her mother gave her father on the day they were married.

 ""I know the board of trustees thinks I'm trying to live up to the standards they set for me, and that's O.K.,"" she said. But she is aiming toward the higher standard set for her by Fannie Stubblefield, who never had the chance to go beyond the seventh grade.

 The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered earlier this year, said his wife, Elaine.

 As one of the first consultants hired in 1956 by Heidrick & Struggles, Mr. Johnston was a leader in the firm's expansion outside its Chicago home. Today, Heidrick & Struggles is one of the country's largest executive search firms and is often called on to find top executives at some of the country's largest corporations.

 Mr. Johnston opened the firm's office in Los Angeles, its first outside Chicago, and became director of West Coast operations in 1960. Later he supervised the creation of the firm's London office, its first outside the United States, and in 1970 he became chief executive. From 1978 to 1981 he was chairman, and he remained with the company as honorary chairman until 1991, when he retired.

 Born in Oak Park, Ill., Mr. Johnston graduated from St. Mary's College in Winona, Minn., and served in the Navy during World War II. After the war, Mr. Johnston was a specialist in personnel management at various corporations, starting with Western Electric, in 1946. As retail personnel manager at Montgomery Ward & Company he met John Struggles, a founder of the firm that bears his name.

 Besides his wife, Mr. Johnston is survived by four daughters, Elene Kapp of Santa Ana, Calif., Molly Johnston of Altadena, Calif., Anne Gardner of Pasadena, Calif., Karen Johnston of Larchmont, N.Y.; a son, John of San Francisco, two sisters, Sister Katrine Johnston of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, of Dubuque, Iowa, and Kathleen Gaumond of Spring Park, Minn., and six grandchildren.","Thomas J.

1995-10-31 00:00:00,51740,"Thomas F. Murphy, whose career in law and law enforcement brought him to the prosecutor's table in the Alger Hiss case, to the office of New York City Police Commissioner and ultimately to the Federal bench, died on Thursday at Noble Horizons, a nursing home in Salisbury, Conn. Mr. Murphy, who formerly lived in Sharon, Conn., was 89.

 Bulldog tenacity and a quiet, persistent pursuit of facts were hallmarks of Mr. Murphy's career. Tall (6 feet 4 inches), heavyset (250 pounds) and well tailored, the walrus-mustached Mr. Murphy sometimes reminded people of Theodore Roosevelt, who was also a Police Commissioner of New York City.

 In 1949, in Mr. Murphy's most famous case, he was the assistant United States attorney designated to be the lead prosecutor in the famous trial of Mr. Hiss, a former State Department official accused of perjury. In a case that bitterly divided the public at a time of concern about Communist infiltration of the Government, Mr. Hiss was accused of having lied by denying he had passed confidential documents to Whittaker Chambers, an avowed Communist and courier for the party.

 After six weeks, the first trial ended in a hung jury. The retrial lasted 10 weeks. Each morning and afternoon, after court adjourned, Mr. Murphy went directly to his office and dictated a detailed series of notes on what had taken place.

 Fueling himself with steaming pots of coffee late into the night, he pored over the court record and eventually dragged out damaging contradictions. When it came time to address the jury, Mr. Murphy delivered a two-and-a-half hour summation without ever glancing at his notes. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on Jan. 21, 1950.

 That fall, given a mandate by Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri to root out corruption, Mr. Murphy took over a Police Department undermined by the disclosures of a Brooklyn bookmaker named Harry Gross that widespread corruption and collusion had spread into the highest levels of the 19,000-member force.

 Mr. Murphy, who would hold the job for less than a year, moved quickly to replace every member of the 336-man plainclothes squad with younger officers and instituted a policy of promotions through merit. He shuffled 21 members of the senior staff and won praise for firmness and resolute action. In the Mayoral election that took place shortly after his appointment, Republican and Democratic candidates alike expressed admiration for him.

 Discussing the police, Mr. Murphy was quick to note, ""For every cop who will take a buck from a bookie, there are hundreds who will stand up for you and me and take a bullet.""

 The next year, as he looked back, he said: ""I am convinced today that basically, the large percentage of public servants are morally and intellectually honest. They try to do a day's job, honestly and conscientiously. There should be no place in government for the venal rascals who bring harm to other loyal workers as well as violate the public trust.""

 That attitude, as well as Mr. Murphy's Democratic politics and his success as a prosecutor, doubtless helped to convince President Harry S. Truman to appoint Mr. Murphy to the United States District Court in July 1951.

 As a Federal judge, Mr. Murphy presided over a wide range of cases. They included those involving the Swedish sex film ""I Am Curious -- Yellow,"" which he termed ""repulsive and revolting""; James R. Hoffa, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who was charged with wiretapping, and a former Yale lecturer, Vladimir Sokolov, who, Judge Murphy ruled, concealed his past as a World War II Nazi propagandist.

 Mr. Murphy, who was born in Manhattan, was a son of Thomas Murphy, for many years the chief clerk of the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity and a grandson of a New York City patrolman. Thomas Murphy was not the only one of the four children in his family to achieve renown. His younger brother, Fireman Johnny Murphy, was an ace relief pitcher for the New York Yankees in the 1930's and 40's before finishing his career with the Boston Red Sox and eventually becoming general manager of the New York Mets.

 In fact, when Mr. Hiss was finally convicted and Mr. Murphy, his wife and another couple sought release from the tensions of the trial by going to a nightclub, they were emerging from a taxi when the driver asked the other man in the cab:

 ""Who's the big fellow?""

 ""That's Tom Murphy, the man who just convicted Alger Hiss,"" came the reply.

 ""Oh,"" the driver said, ""you mean Johnny Murphy's brother!""

 Thomas Murphy graduated from Regis High School and entered Georgetown University, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1927. Three years later, he received a law degree from Fordham University and, after admission to the bar that year, joined the firm of Alcott, Holmes, Glass & Paul and spent the next 12 years in private practice.

 In 1942, Mr. Murphy became an assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, and two years later became head of the office's criminal division, prosecuting embezzlement, smuggling, draft evasions, kidnapping, stock and mail fraud, counterfeiting, draft evasion and other Federal crimes.

 Seven years later, after compiling a 99 percent conviction record, he became chief prosecutor in the Hiss trials.

 He served on the Federal bench until taking senior judge status. In 1968, after he moved to Connecticut, he became a visiting judge for the Federal District of Connecticut in Waterbury, and also served during the winter months on the Ninth Circuit bench in Arizona and Connecticut.

 In addition to his wife, Katherine, Mr. Murphy is survived by a sister, Anna Henn of New York City.","Thomas F.

1995-06-16 00:00:00,11669,"Fred Rosenstiel, who spent his life planting gardens to brighten the lives of his fellow New Yorkers, and to alleviate an abiding sadness in his heart, died on Tuesday at the Western Queens Community Hospital in Astoria. He was 83 and lived recently in Astoria.

 In a city where corps of volunteer gardeners seem to spring up like wildflowers, Mr. Rosenstiel was a volunteer gardener with a difference, a man so driven that for four decades he did little else.

 Since arriving in New York in 1951, Mr. Rosenstiel, the son of a prosperous Dutch businessman who left him enough money to live on, had made gardens, coaxing green shoots of life from the New York soil.

 ""He was a master plantsman,"" said Barbara Earnest, the director of the New York Horticultural Society, recalling Mr. Rosenstiel as the city's most dedicated and prolific volunteer gardener, one who lent his expertise and his brawn to community gardening groups and worked on his own to plant flowers on virtually any patch of unpaved earth in the city.

 Whether part of a group or working alone, Mr. Rosenstiel, whose name means ""rose stalk"" in German, planted gardens in parks, vacant lots, schools, housing projects, hospitals and homeless shelters.

 A founder of the Green Guerillas, a group that has organized and tended hundreds of community gardens since 1973, he was also an unpaid consultant to the New York City Council on the Environment and to many other organizations.

 A long-time resident of the Upper West Side, he would leave his apartment on West 113th Street at 8 A.M. and would rarely be home before midnight, sometimes visiting three or more community gardens in a day.

 When he was not on his knees, digging his hands into the earth to root out Japanese knotweed threatening a garden in Riverside Park or planting the yellow flowering lamium he knew would thrive in the ubiquitous New York shade, Mr. Rosenstiel, a tall, powerfully built man with granite features, could often be found immersed in a newspaper at a Broadway coffee shop.

 Known as a sad man who found an elusive joy in gardening and music, Mr. Rosenstiel became a familiar figure on the Upper West Side, a neighborhood character in a beret and tweed jacket who carried a shopping bag crammed with gardening equipment and made it a point of honor never to travel anywhere except by subway.

 He often held court at the old Mill Luncheonette at 111th Street and Broadway, where he would harangue Columbia University students, often urging them to adopt surprisingly radical positions.

 They called him ""the Professor.""

 ""Perhaps I would have had a more interesting career had I been forced to make a living,"" he once told a friend, before adding, ""These are the ironies of life.""

 Mr. Rosenstiel was on intimate terms with such ironies. In his family the ironies twisted back on themselves.

 His parents were German Jews who immigrated to England, where they suffered such anti-German prejudice during World War I that they moved to the Netherlands.

 Mr. Rosenstiel, who was born in London and grew up there and in Rotterdam before going to school in Switzerland, was the only member of his family who survived the Nazis.

 His only brother was killed fighting as a soldier with the Dutch Army. His parents and several aunts, uncles and cousins died at Auschwitz.

 Mr. Rosenstiel, who was in England at the outbreak of the war and who later served four years as a seaman with the Britain-based Dutch Navy, seemed to find it hard to forgive himself for surviving the Holocaust, friends said. He felt such guilt, he once told a friend, that he felt he was not entitled to any happiness.

 That, he explained, is why he never married, never pursued a career. He simply planted gardens, a delight he had stumbled on at a cooperative London youth hostel when he volunteered to tend its garden as a way of getting out of doing the dishes.

 In his later years he found a measure of comfort with Esther Lazarson, a woman who had loved him since the day they met in 1969 and who took him in when he became too sick to care for himself four years ago.

 Ms. Lazarson, a native of England who has lived in New York off and on since 1951, recalled yesterday that Mr. Rosenstiel had once offered her a white begonia if she would stay in New York, but she wanted more than he was prepared to give at the time. He had learned from the Holocaust, she said, how much you can lose and how quickly when you love too much.

 ""He gave me a white begonia when I came back,"" she added.","Fred Rosenstiel, who spent his life planting gardens to brighten the lives of his fellow New Yorkers, and to alleviate an abiding sadness in his heart, died on Tuesday at the Western Queens Community Hospital in Astoria.","June 16, 1995, Friday, Late Edition - Final  Fred Rosenstiel, 83, Devoted His Life to Planting Flowers"
1995-06-13 00:00:00,11644,"G. J. Tankersley, who was chairman and chief executive of the Consolidated Natural Gas Company from 1979 to 1987 and who led the company into energy exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico, died on Sunday. He was 74.

 He died at his home in Stahlstown, Pa., from complications related to a degenerative muscle disease, said Cynthia Navadeh, a company spokeswoman.

 When Mr. Tankersley took over Consolidated, which is based in Pittsburgh, it was mostly an interstate pipeline company and a distributor of natural gas. He led the company into the risky business of exploring for gas and oil in the Gulf of Mexico, a venture that eventually turned the company into a significant producer.

 Consolidated has since built up its position in the gulf, making heavy investments in deep-water exploration. One of its deep-water ventures has led to a major addition to its oil and gas reserves.

 Outside the energy business, Mr. Tankersley served as chairman of the Pittsburgh branch of the Federal Reserve Bank and as vice chairman of the board of the University of Pittsburgh. He also served two terms as president of the Pittsburgh Symphony Society.

 He graduated from Auburn University in 1943 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He began his career in the gas industry in 1949. He joined Consolidated in 1966 as president of the East Ohio Gas Company, a subsidiary, in Cleveland. He became the subsidiary's chairman in 1973.

 He served as the first chairman of the National Alliance of Businessmen in Cleveland, working to promote the hiring of members of minorities.

 He and his wife, the former Mary Armstrong, who died in 1993, created an endowment for the International Aquaculture Network at Auburn, which seeks to ease world hunger by improving fish farming.

1996-07-10 00:00:00,18159,"Melvin Belli, an impressario of a lawyer who pioneered new techniques and huge settlements in personal injury cases and who defended Jack Ruby, the man who shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald, died yesterday at his home in San Francisco. He was 88.

 ""He was sitting; he just stopped breathing,"" Edward Lozzi, Mr. Belli's publicist, said, adding that Mr. Belli was with his wife, Nancy Ho Belli.

 In a profession storied as much for its histrionics as for its seriousness of purpose, Mr. Belli was a superstar. With his square-jawed portly good looks, flowing mane and scarlet-silk-lined suits, he was at once leonine and bearish. He delivered his lines in court with an oleaginous voice whose resonance suggested entombment in his generous frame, a voice that for more than half a century seemed always to discharge its burden of quotable phrase quickly, incisively, almost hypnotically.

 But even when he failed, even when his eloquence became grandiloquence, Mr. Belli beguiled jurors and journalists alike.

 Such was the case in 1964 when he defended Ruby, who had gunned down Oswald in Dallas police headquarters as millions of Americans watched on television that Sunday in November 1963, two days after Oswald killed President John F. Kennedy. Indeed, Mr. Belli became a national celebrity after the Ruby trial, which he lost, a distinction that had eluded him after the earlier cases he so ably won.

 Harold Scarlett, who covered the Ruby trial for The Houston Post, wrote that Mr. Belli ""played that voice like a symphony.""

 ""It was by turns a Stradivarius, a bugle, an oboe, a snare drum racing at breakneck speed through key passages of trial testimony,"" Mr. Scarlett wrote. ""Clarence Darrow would have liked it.""

 But the jury quickly found Ruby guilty of what a nation had seen him do; Mr. Belli was unable to persuade Dallas jurors that Ruby should be treated with leniency and compassion because of his mental state. Although Ruby would have his conviction overturned on appeal, he died in 1967 before he could get a new trial.

 Mr. Belli, who would be dismissed and left largely unpaid by the Ruby family, exploded in rage when he heard the verdict and publicly accused Dallas of being ""a sick, sick, sick city"" and said that Ruby, a Jew, had been the victim of discrimination.

 With Maurice C. Carroll, a journalist who had covered the trial for The New York Herald Tribune, he wrote a book called ""Dallas Justice -- The Real Story of Jack Ruby and His Trial.""

 Mr. Belli's courtroom display was found unseemly by both the American Bar Association and the Texas Bar Association. It was only one of many criticisms that were directed against Mr. Belli in the course of his career. And the level of esteem by which he was held by his fellow lawyers was not enhanced when he suggested that the prestige he got from membership in the American Bar Association was rather the same thing he got from membership in the Book-of-the-Month Club.

 In 1966, Mr. Belli was even banned from the convention program of the American Trial Lawyers Association, the very group he had helped found as something of an alternative to the bar associations filled with corporate lawyers. The trial lawyers association said the ban was approved for reasons of ""propriety.""

 A Gallery of Clients That Was Never Dull

 Propriety was sometimes hard to find among Mr. Belli's more famous clients, who were hardly the choirboys and choirgirls of their time. Among the notables were Mickey Cohen, a gangster who gambled, and Errol Flynn, an actor who gamboled. Others included Lenny Bruce, the comedian whose humor made heavy use of language and ideas that some found objectionable; Mae West, the actress appreciated by generations of young and not-so-young men for her sultry spoofs of sex; Mario Savio, the most vocal of the Berkeley student protesters of the late 1960's; and Ferdinand W. Demara Jr., who somehow convinced a great many people over the years that he was a Trappist monk, a college dean, a cancer researcher, a surgeon and a teacher, when, in fact, he was none of those things. Mr. Demara's life was depicted by Tony Curtis in the movie ""The Great Imposter."" Mr. Demara sought Mr. Belli's help when he was accused of being a child molester. Mr. Belli said the charges were specious and got him off.

 Among Mr. Belli's clients was also Winnie Ruth Judd, declared insane and sent to a mental hospital in the 1931 murders of two people who were stuffed into a trunk in Phoenix. Mr. Belli met her in 1969, seven years after she had escaped from the Arizona State Hospital. He managed to get her sentence commuted to time served.

 There were also Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, the television evangelists. The Bakkers were so taken with Mr. Belli that they gave him a gilt-edged Bible as a band played ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."" Mr. Belli, never to be outdone by such gracious gestures, gave the Bakkers the use of the deck of his yacht so they could plan their moves. It did no good; in 1989 Jim Bakker was convicted of 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, sentenced to 45 years in prison, and fined $500,000. His wife, now Tammy Faye Messner, was not charged. Mr. Belli called Mr. Bakker the ""finest client"" he had ever had in 53 years of practice.

 Such associations may have ruffled some of Mr. Belli's more conservative colleagues. Certain aspects of his personal life, of which he made no secret, may have ruffled them even more, for Mr. Belli was both a lawyer and a lover.

 He made no secret of his friendship with Errol Flynn and that the two of them liked to go on the town together; that he once had his pet greyhound listed in the San Francisco telephone directory; that he drank prodigious amounts of port; that he was so much the actor that he began to do in front of cameras what he earlier had done only in court. Thus he portrayed an extraterrestrial creature on television's ""Star Trek,"" and appeared in such Hollywood productions as ""Devil's Dolls,"" where he played an army colonel, and ""Wild in the Streets,"" in which he was a lawyer.

 ""Am I romantic?"" Mr. Belli asked in his 1976 autobiography, ""My Life on Trial."" He answered: ""Of course I am. Show me a good trial lawyer who isn't. Good trial lawyers have a zest for life, a penchant for all good things bright and beautiful, kinky and flawed, for good wines, great tables, wide travels and beautiful women.""

 All of this may have overshadowed some of his stunning triumphs: the $19 million settlement his firm helped win for the 16 families of the American servicemen who died in the Christmas 1986 air crash at Gander, Newfoundland; the $32 million it got from California crematoriums that mishandled the disposal of the remains of the deceased; the many people who got substantial settlements because of the damages they suffered through accidents; and his more than 60 books that he wrote or co-wrote, some of them consulted by lawyers to this day.

 A Growing Fame Arising From Audacity

 Melvin Mouron Belli was born July 29, 1907 in Sonora, Calif., the son of Caesar Arthur and Leonie Mouron Belli. He claimed that his maternal grandmother, Anna Mouron, was the first female pharmacist in California. He was also quite proud of his father, who, he said, could do ""marvelous feats like multiply 8,648 times 1,342,765 without pencil or paper."" The elder Belli did many things successfully, from timekeeper to rancher.

 The family surname is Italian, but the Bellis originated in Switzerland. The name was pronounced ""bell-eye,"" apparently because if said the Italian way, it would sound like ""belly.""

 Mr. Belli was valedictorian of the class of 1925 at Stockton High School, then went to the University of California at Berkeley in 1929, where he got only average grades. Still, he gained admission to Boalt Hall, the prestigious law school of the University of California. But he did not make law review and received a mere ""C"" in torts, the legal label for any injury for which damages can be sought and the area of law where he would become a legend.

 He first began to attract attention in 1941 because of his aggressive representation of people who had been damaged in some way and his considerable creative skill in developing new courtroom techniques to present their cases. A case in point in the early 40's was his representation of Katherine Jeffers, a young mother whose leg was severed by a San Francisco trolley. A jury awarded her $65,000, but lawyers for the trolley company appealed because, they said, the award was too high.

 On appeal, Mr. Belli appeared in court with an L-shaped package wrapped in cheap yellow paper, tied with soft white string. The judge and the opposing lawyer stared at it; the jurors suspected that the woman's severed leg was wrapped up in the package. After a couple of days, Mr. Belli began to move the package around on his desk. He did not open it, however, until he was in the midst of his summation. He held up Mrs. Jeffers' artificial leg. The defense lawyer started to object, then fell silent.

 ""Ladies and gentleman of the jury,"" Mr. Belli said, moving to the jurors, ""this is what my pretty young client will wear for the rest of her life. Take it.""

 And with that, he dumped the leg on the lap of the first juror.

 ""Feel the warmth of life in the soft tissues of its flesh,"" he said, ""feel the pulse of the blood as it flows through the veins, feel the marvelous smooth articulation at the new joint and touch the rippling muscles of the calf.""

 This time, the jury deliberated for only 20 minutes and awarded Mrs. Jeffers $100,000 -- $35,000 more than she got the first time and 10 times the going rate for the loss of a limb in those days.

 ""There may be better lawyers than I,"" Mr. Belli would say when he was in his prime, ""but so far I haven't seen any of them in court.""

 A Showcase Office Tailored to His Style

 As his fame spread and his practice grew -- in 1954 Life magazine called him the King of Torts -- the Belli office at 722 Montgomery Street, a historical landmark in downtown San Francisco, developed a look not normally associated with the staid offices of proper lawyers. Mr. Belli's office seemed transmogrified, the story went, into the parlor of a bordertown bordello at the turn of the century.

 Once his clients moved through courtyard filled with wisteria, geraniums and small-leaf-ivy and past the wrought-iron gate at the front door, they were surrounded with brocade and velvet, lavender-tinted windows, royal red Persian carpets that tickled their shoelaces, mahogany paneling, a red French hall porter's chair and two stuffed chairs of some vintage near his mahogany desk. Above, four crystal chandeliers hung from a white ceiling flecked with gold trim that carried four gold cupids ariding.

 On his desk he kept a jeweled crown (not for monarchical reasons, only to hold paper clips and to play ""Let Me Call You Sweetheart"" whenever it was moved) and to one side there was a skeleton, a female mannequin, some braids of garlic, apothecary bottles from Mr. Belli's grandmother's drug store, a splendid wet bar, a ship's wheel and many hundreds of books. And there were tapestries from Nepal and a tiger skin rug bought from Elizabeth Taylor. It never lacked for warmth: Mr. Belli also had working gas jets in the marble fireplace that could burn a make-believe log.

 The office's west wall was of glass, so passing tourists could see the Great One at work. He loved it when they waved, and if he saw them, he always waved back.

 In his later years, Mr. Belli's firm maintained a huge caseload. Some lawyers and disappointed clients claimed that he had accepted too many cases and that he was personally making mistakes he never made in his prime.

 In 1988, for example, Mr. Belli and a colleague were fined $5,000 by a Federal judge in San Juan, P.R., because after fire had destroyed the Dupont Plaza Hotel there, they had filed a damage suit on behalf of the widow of a man they thought had been killed in the fire. In fact, the man had died 12 years earlier.

 Mr. Belli steadfastly denied he was trying too much and estimated in 1987 that he had won more than $350 million for clients through cases either won or settled.

 In 1995, however, Mr. Belli announced that he was filing for protection under the bankruptcy laws. He said he had had a falling out with some of his former partners and was further made impecunious because of a divorce settlement. He said his expected cash flow from a major national breast implant case, in which he represented several clients, had been delayed.

 But he added, ""Any legitimate creditor will not lose a dime by our reorganization.""

 Mr. Belli was married five times. In addition to his wife, whom he married on March 29, Mr. Belli's survivors include his children, Richard R., Melvin M. Jr., Jean, Susan, Caesar M., and Melia.","Melvin Belli, an impressario of a lawyer who pioneered new techniques and huge settlements in personal injury cases and who defended Jack Ruby, the man who shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald, died yesterday at his home in San Francisco.","July 10, 1996, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final                               Correction Appended  Melvin Belli Dies at 88; Flamboyant Lawyer Relished His Role as King of Torts"

 She had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for several years, and could not walk or talk for the last year, said her husband, Herman, a mayoral adviser and former Congressman.

 Mrs. Badillo worked for the Carey and Cuomo administrations as the deputy director of the Division for Women from 1978 until 1986, when she took over the New York City office of the State Department of Social Services. She retired in 1990.

 As the Deputy Director of the Division for Women, Mrs. Badillo helped run the state's efforts to pass an Equal Rights Amendment, organizing rallies and conferences in various cities and towns.

 ""She was one of the strongest and most passionate defenders of the Equal Rights Amendment,"" Mr. Badillo said. ""The amendment lost, but in New York State we put up a tremendous fight for it, and she was a big part of it.""

 Even before her career in state government, Mrs. Badillo was active on social issues. In the 1960's she worked for two poverty programs: the Suburban Action Institute, which aimed to build low- and moderate-income housing in New York, and the Center for Urban Education, which focused on the needs of New York City schools.

 Mrs. Badillo was born in New York City. She was a graduate of Empire State College.

 Mr. Tokugawa, a descendant of the feudal-era Tokugawa shoguns, had been in poor health since his retirement in 1988. He had been hospitalized at Tokyo University Hospital with breathing problems since December, said a spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency.

 Mr. Tokugawa became Chamberlain to Emperor Hirohito, known posthumously as the Showa Emperor, in 1936 after graduating with a degree in art history from Tokyo University and then studying for three years at the University of Berlin.

 On the morning of Aug. 15, 1945, he blocked rebellious soldiers from seizing a recording in which the Emperor announced Japan's surrender in World War II. The soldiers, who wanted Japan to fight to the death, had broken into the palace and demanded that Mr. Tokugawa turn over the tape in an effort to prevent the surrender from being broadcast.

 Mr. Tokugawa refused to disclose the tape's location. The broadcast was made as scheduled at noon to a population that had been taught to revere the Emperor as a god and had never heard his voice.

 Mr. Tokugawa became Grand Chamberlain in 1985, and then resigned in late 1988, citing poor health.

1996-09-03 00:00:00,18449,"Norman Harry Hollow, a former tribal chairman of the Fort Peck, Mont., Indian reservation, which is home to members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes, died in his sleep early Saturday at his ranch near Fort Kipp, Mont. He was 76.

 He had been in failing health after having heart surgery earlier this year, said his grandson Spike Bighorn, according to The Associated Press.

 Mr. Hollow, a Sioux, held the tribal chairman's post for a dozen years, beginning in 1973, and then stepped down to let a new chairman take over and to spend more time on personal matters.

 As chairman, he was involved in negotiations that led to a 1985 water rights agreement -- between the tribes of the Fort Peck reservation and the State of Montana -- which guaranteed for all time the water rights of tribe members and nearby non-Indians. State officials said then that it was the first such pact in Montana that was reached by negotiating and not by courtroom strife.

 In 1982 he was given an Interior Department award for being an outstanding Indian leader, and he received numerous other honors over the years for his work in Indian affairs.

 In 1981, the Supreme Court upheld a $106 million award to the Sioux Nation after a long legal struggle by the Sioux to win just compensation for the Government's seizure of their sacred Black Hills in South Dakota more than a century earlier.

 ""This case dates back to 1922,"" Mr. Hollow said in 1981. ""I remember when I was a little boy this was all the old-timers talked about, the Black Hills case.""

 Before becoming tribal chairman, he served, from 1947 to 1973, as a member of the Fort Peck reservation's tribal executive board. In 1993, the reservation had a work force of more than 5,700 Indians and almost two million acres of land spread over four counties.

 Mr. Hollow was born in Fort Kipp, went to high school nearby in Culbertson, Mont., became a cross-country runner and a horseman as a youth and worked as a construction worker and a farm hand. Then, in the 1940's, he went into the cattle business and began farm operations of his own.

 In addition to Mr. Bighorn, he is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Vera Bertelsen; two daughters, Doremis Bighorn of Brockton, Mont., and Sharon Vierra of San Lorenzo, Calif.; three other grandchildren; eight great-grandchildren; two sisters, Caroline Yellowrobe of Wolf Point, Mont., and Harriet Wellington of Sacaton, Ariz., and a brother, Anton of Marysville, Wash.","Norman Harry Hollow, a former tribal chairman of the Fort Peck, Mont., Indian reservation, which is home to members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes, died in his sleep early Saturday at his ranch near Fort Kipp, Mont.","September 3, 1996, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final  N.

1997-09-02 00:00:00,45748,"John F. Eichorn Jr., a retired chairman and chief executive of Eastern Utilities Associates who played a significant role in completing the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire, died of cancer on Aug. 19. He was 73 and lived in Santa Monica, Calif.

 Mr. Eichorn headed Eastern, an electric utility holding company based in Boston, from 1972 until his retirement as chief executive in 1989.

 He gained attention in the 1980's when Eastern Utilities took a big stake in the Seabrook plant, a project that had been plagued with costly construction delays and was the target of antinuclear protestors. Mr. Eichorn's commitment to the plant helped it finally go into service in 1990.

 Earlier, in the 1970's, he had gone to Poland to negotiate favorable prices for imported coal for the Northeast, which helped the utilities in the region weather the energy crisis. He was also one of the pioneers in establishing the New England Power Pool, the first regional electricity distribution grid in the nation.

 Mr. Eichorn was born in Boston. He received a bachelor of science degree from the University of Maine.

1997-06-13 00:00:00,22006,"Cardboard boxes clutter the floor of Dr. Mary Hibberd's office here, some filled with files to discard and others bulging with mementos to keep. Her desk is strewn with folders and a hammer and a screwdriver for removing photos from the wood-paneled wall.

 Dr. Hibberd, the Suffolk County Health Commissioner, is making an abrupt and highly publicized career change in a life that has never worked out quite the way she planned.

 Her pattern was set early, when hopes of becoming a naturalist were thwarted by a graduate program's males-only policy. Since then, her zigzag career as a scientist and pediatrician has taken her to a remote Montana Indian reservation, the squalor of Bangladesh and the poorest neighborhoods of Long Island.

 None of it seemed to prepare Dr. Hibberd for the rough and tumble of politics in Suffolk County. She says she was ousted because she would not play patronage games; her detractors disputed her health policies and said she was a poor manager. In any case, by Friday, she will have vacated her office.

 As Dr. Hibberd sorted through her things, she said, ""Look -- here's something."" It was the plaque commemorating her induction in March into the Suffolk County Women's Hall of Fame. Etched at the bottom is the name of County Executive Robert J. Gaffney -- who two months later, without warning, created a committee to search for her successor.

 Dr. Hibberd was in Virginia picking up her daughter from college, and found out when she called her answering machine from a pay phone in a Wendy's and heard urgent messages from reporters.

 ""It was very painful,"" she recalled. ""I was crying and saying it's not fair -- I'm not there to defend myself. We drove back home in this big line of violent thunderstorms. It seemed like the perfect metaphor.""

 Mr. Gaffney said his decision stemmed from a growing rift with Dr. Hibberd over health policies. He also questioned her management skills, saying that her agency had failed to get millions of dollars in state aid, that malpractice expenses were high and that its managed-care system was floundering.

 Dr. Hibberd rebutted his complaints, saying, for example, that Suffolk would get all its state aid after the normal lags in claims, payments and budget cycles. But she also mounted a counterattack, saying that the real reason for her removal was that she blocked attempts at interference by Mr. Gaffney, his top aides, two legislators and others.

 Over the years, she said, those officials had tried to foist unqualified but politically connected job candidates on her agency. She said they also tried to force her agency to spend money advertising in a politically connected newspaper and tried to strong-arm her into backing off on smoking regulations to help their business friends.

 Dr. Hibberd, 50, a divorced mother of two who is given to quoting Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said she would not give in. ""My duty is to protect the public health, not to engage in politics,"" she said.

 Nor did she seem concerned about losing her job. ""I always think God has a plan, even though we don't know it,"" she said.

 Dr. Hibberd has a legion of admirers who see her as a Mother Teresa who championed suburbia's invisible needy, and, in the process, cut Suffolk's infant mortality rate by more than 40 percent.

 ""Mary is credible, and the rest of them aren't,"" said Maxine Postal, a Democrat and chairwoman of the County Legislature's Health Committee. ""That slim woman has a backbone made of tempered steel. From the person who does the maintenance work right up to the top, they say she's the very best we've ever had.""

 Mr. Gaffney and the other officials denied the charges of interference. Mr. Gaffney declined to be interviewed for this article.

 Although some people called for an investigation get to the bottom of the dispute, there appears little chance of that. Instead, Dr. Hibberd will start a new job Monday as a senior executive at Ipro, a health-care consulting firm in Lake Success.

 Growing up in Upper Darby, Pa., Dr. Hibberd never envisioned that she would some day be at the helm of a $275 million-a-year health agency.

 ""It was actually a fluky thing,"" Dr. Hibberd said of her career. Her own requirement was to find something ""that was work I wanted to do and that made a difference."" After being shut out of the naturalists' program, she earned a master's degree in microbial genetics, then another in human genetics, which led her into medicine.

 ""I liked surgery best, but women rarely went into that,"" she said, so she shifted to pediatrics. In nearly five years practicing at the Flathead Indian reservation, she realized the medical toll of social and economic ills. ""I saw a lot of unemployment, alcoholism, fetal alcohol syndrome.""

 Her career was transformed again by 10 months as a volunteer in the Care Medico program in Bangladesh. ""People went blind from lack of vitamin A. There was scurvy, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, TB -- all preventable. You could save thousands.""

 She earned a master's degree in public health and took a residency in community and preventive health at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. A stint at the Suffolk Health Department prompted a job offer, and she became director of reproductive care for six years. County Executive Patrick Halpin named her acting health commissioner in 1991, and Mr. Gaffney made the appointment permanent.

 Many trace her undoing to a dispute four years ago with Suffolk's District Attorney, James Catterson Jr.

 She accused Mr. Catterson of threatening to investigate her agency unless she overturned the failing results of a psychological exam given to a son of a longtime associate of his. The son, an investigator in Mr. Catterson's office, needed to pass for authorization to carry a gun.

 Perhaps emboldened by Dr. Hibberd, other Republican officials also began to speak out, saying that Mr. Catterson had improperly pressured them on various issues. But he denied all the complaints, and a state inquiry ended with no action taken against him.

 ""There's a pattern here of someone who sees things that other people don't,"" Mr. Catterson said in an interview. ""I've never understood her agenda."" He said Dr. Hibberd had been ""canonized"" by the news media, but he conceded, ""She comes across in private as she does in public, as Mother Teresa, and it's very disarming.""

 Her tenacity, however, hardly ingratiated her with Mr. Gaffney. This year she went over his head to the County Legislature to win more funds for her department.

 About the last thing to come down from Dr. Hibberd's office wall was a display of 13 color snapshots of beaming mothers and their babies from Project Hope, in which health workers monitor infants through their critical first year.

 ""This is one of the programs I started and one of the best things in the department,"" she said. ""So I am definitely taking these pictures. It just makes you feel good.""","Cardboard boxes clutter the floor of Dr. Mary Hibberd's office here, some filled with files to discard and others bulging with mementos to keep.","June 13, 1997, Friday, Late Edition - Final  Bounced Commissioner Practices Her Rebound"

 Mr. Epley, a lawyer by training, became president of Texaco in 1964, and ran the company during a period of rapid change and expansion at Texaco and throughout the energy industry, a corporate spokesman said yesterday.

 Mr. Epley was chairman of the company for about a year until his retirement in 1971. He and his wife, Dorris, then moved to Palm Beach, where he served for several years as president of Good Samaritan Hospital.

 Mr. Epley was born in Hattiesburg, Miss., and earned his undergraduate and law degrees at Tulane University in New Orleans, where he practiced law, except for service in the Navy in the war years, until joining Texaco in 1947. Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Marion J. Epley 3d of Millbrook, N.Y.; a daughter, Sara Epley Davis of Houston, seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.","Marion J.

He was 77 and a resident of Rochester, where he served as cantor of Temple Beth El from 1946 until retiring 10 years ago.

 The cause was heart failure, his family said.

 Cantor Rosenbaum was a leader in the court fight to win government recognition for cantors as members of the clergy. He was one of 10 cantors who formed the Cantors Assembly at Jewish Theological Seminary in 1947 and saw it grow into the world's largest body of Jewish prayer leaders.

1997-06-17 00:00:00,22020,"Milton Blatt, an inspiring teacher and coach at Andrew Jackson High School in Queens who guided its track and cross-country teams to national prominence, died last Thursday at his home in Glen Cove, N.Y. He was 87.

 Mr. Blatt's impact was felt by thousands of students during his 42 years in the New York school system, and he steered many on to college as an adviser. He was also an English teacher, but was most noted for his coaching at Jackson, located in Cambria Heights, Queens.

 On the day Andrew Jackson opened in 1937, Mr. Blatt transferred there after having taught at Jamaica High School.

 In the 1940's, after having served as an English teacher and Jackson's tennis coach, he was asked by some students if he could also coach track and field. He had never done so, but went to the library and took out several books on the sport.

 His caring style gave him the nickname Uncle Miltie among his runners, whom he led to 14 Public Schools Athletic League citywide championships as well as 16 borough titles. He helped produce two Olympians, Vince Matthews, a 1965 graduate who captured the gold medal at 400 meters in Munich, Germany, in 1972, and Julio Meade, who competed at that distance for the Dominican Republic in 1968.

 ""Coach Blatt was very special to the many lives that he touched,"" said Mr. Meade, now a business executive living in Virginia. ""He would sit with you and say, 'You can do this, you can do that' -- not only in track but also in your studies. To this day, I am very thankful to Coach Blatt, because he basically changed my life.""

 If students had trouble getting to a meet, he would pick them up, one of his runners, Sam Thomas, a city champion half-miler, once recalled.

 Indeed, to the dismay of his wife, son and daughter, he sold the family pride and joy, a Volvo they had purchased in Europe in the 1960's, because, he said, ""It's not big enough for my boys."" He meant the four young men on the relay team he usually chauffeured, along with their equipment.

 In an attempt to produce a national scholastic record in the two-mile relay, he once orchestrated a 1966 match race against Boys High of Brooklyn. The result became a legend among track buffs.

 The teams met on the St. John's University oval in Jamaica, Queens. Meade was a sprinter, but Coach Blatt sensed he could run a top-notch opening half-mile, so he put him on the leadoff leg. Meade set a blistering pace and pulled everyone who followed along with him faster than they had ever gone before.

 When it was over, the two teams had shattered the national record by seven seconds. Each was timed in 7 minutes 35.6 seconds -- with Jackson gaining a victory of inches. The record stands today, and is believed to be the oldest high school track mark.

 The Jackson teams never enjoyed having assistant coaches. But Coach Blatt, who retired in 1972, had huge squads numbering 60 to 70 athletes.

 Mr. Blatt, who was born in New York City, graduated from Jamaica High School and received bachelor's and master's degrees from the City College of New York.

 He is survived by his wife, Jennie; a son, Joel, of New York City; a daughter, Janet, of Glen Cove, a sister and two brothers.","Milton Blatt, an inspiring teacher and coach at Andrew Jackson High School in Queens who guided its track and cross-country teams to national prominence, died last Thursday at his home in Glen Cove, N.Y.","June 17, 1997, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final  Milton Blatt, 87, Track Coach and Teacher"

 The cause of death was a heart attack, said his son, Lamond Charles Godwin.

 Mr. Godwin founded Peachtree Asset Management, which manages large equity portfolios for corporations, pension funds, endowments and other institutional clients, in 1994. He was also a managing director of Salomon Smith Barney.

 Mr. Godwin joined American Express Bank, a division of the American Express Company, as senior director and first vice president in 1986.

1998-05-12 00:00:00,57215,"Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a three-time candidate for President of the Dominican Republic who rose from a childhood of extreme poverty to become one of the most prominent black political figures in Latin America, died on Sunday night at his home outside Santo Domingo. He was 61.

 Mr. Pena Gomez had been battling pancreatic and stomach cancer for years, but refused to give up his passion for politics. At his death, he was running for Mayor of Santo Domingo, the country's capital, in municipal and congressional elections scheduled for Saturday, and polls showed him with a comfortable lead.

 President Leonel Fernandez, who narrowly defeated Mr. Pena Gomez in 1996, yesterday decreed a suspension of all campaigning and declared three days of national mourning ""in recognition of the contribution Pena Gomez made to democracy in the Dominican Republic.""

 The campaign will then resume and the election will proceed as scheduled, Government officials said.

 No politician openly acknowledging African ancestry has ever been elected president of any Spanish-speaking Latin American nation in this century, though a few of mixed race have held power. But Mr. Pena Gomez came extremely close to achieving that feat, and even without occupying his country's highest office came to be known throughout the hemisphere as an eloquent spokesman for and defender of political, social and racial equality and justice.

 ""He was a great man, one of the very few people I have known who at critical moments put democracy ahead of his own personal interests,"" Robert Pastor, the director of the Latin American and Caribbean program at the Carter Center in Atlanta who knew Mr. Pena Gomez well, said yesterday.

 Mr. Pena Gomez was born on March 6, 1937, in Valverde to parents of Haitian descent. As an infant, he was orphaned when Rafael Trujillo, the military dictator of the Dominican Republic, ordered a massacre in which more than 10,000 Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent in the border area were killed and additional thousands fled across the border.

 A peasant family took in the foundling, raised him as their own child and gave him their name. In one of the ironies that marked his public life and illustrated his appeal to the poor, Mr. Pena Gomez's running mate in 1996 turned out to be none other than Fernando Alvarez Bogaert, scion of the family that owned the ranch where he was raised.

 ""I am a human being who has experienced many vicissitudes,"" Mr. Pena Gomez said in an interview in 1996. ""I was born in an era of conflicts. I have two sets of parents and two families. One is by blood, and the other is the result of cohabitation. But both are dear to me.""

 As a result of his upbringing, Mr. Pena Gomez relied on his voracious intellectual appetite to supplement a tenuous early education. At 8, he worked in a grocery store and at a bar, and by the time he was a teen-ager he had taken jobs as a shoemaker's and a barber's apprentice.

 At 15, he became an instructor in a literacy program for poor children in his native province and later worked as a teacher in rural and night schools. By 1960 he had moved to Santo Domingo, where he enrolled in a broadcasting course and proved so natural a talent that a radio station quickly hired him to announce baseball games and other sports events.

 At the same time Mr. Pena Gomez was making his first forays into politics. After an interlude when he studied political science at universities in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, he became first the press secretary of the leftist Dominican Revolutionary Party, or P.R.D., and then its Secretary General.

 The P.R.D. was the party of Juan Bosch, the radical firebrand who for 20 years had led the opposition to the Trujillo dictatorship. By the time Mr. Bosch was elected President in 1962, Mr. Pena Gomez had emerged as a protege. Mr. Bosch was ousted by a coup in 1963, however, and that led to a civil war and, in April 1965, an American invasion of the Dominican Republic.

 Mr. Pena Gomez took his oratorical skills to the streets and the airwaves to head the opposition to that intervention, which led to Joaquin Balaguer's becoming President and the P.R.D.'s being cast into the political wilderness for 12 years. Repression was intense throughout that period, and Mr. Pena Gomez eventually had to leave the country.

 Taking refuge in France, he studied political science and constitutional and labor law for two years at the University of Paris. Earlier, Mr. Pena Gomez had earned a law degree from the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo and had also studied political science in courses at Harvard University and Michigan State University.

 In exile he also was involved in efforts to obtain international condemnation of human rights violations in the Dominican Republic, forging relationships with groups that were important for the rest of his life. It was also during that period that Mr. Bosch and Mr. Pena Gomez had a falling out that resulted in Mr. Bosch's breaking with the party that he had founded and setting up a new one.

 In 1982, Mr. Pena Gomez was elected Mayor of Santo Domingo, which automatically made him a strong contender for the presidency. But his party passed him by in 1986, with some of its leaders arguing that it would be impossible for a black man, especially one of Haitian descent, to defeat Mr. Balaguer, who was Foreign Minister at the time of the 1937 massacre and was notorious for his disdain for blacks.

 The P.R.D. lost to Mr. Balaguer anyway, and in 1990, Mr. Pena Gomez finally won the nomination. He finished third in a vote marred by widespread accusations of electoral fraud after a campaign that was full of racial innuendo, but he vowed to try again.

 In 1994 he won his party's nomination for a second time, but had to contend with what electoral observer groups described as race baiting and vote fraud that was even more blatant. The widely questioned final official results showed him losing by 30,000 votes, and though many political observers expected Mr. Pena Gomez to order his followers into the streets to challenge the tally, he chose restraint and negotiation.

 His first bout with cancer followed soon afterward. But the disease went into remission after treatment in the United States, and, with Mr. Balaguer barred from succeeding himself, Mr. Pena Gomez finished ahead of two strong competitors in the first round of a special presidential vote in 1996, receiving 47 percent of the vote. But he fell short of the majority that he needed to avoid a runoff, and was narrowly defeated by Mr. Fernandez in the second round.

 Shortly thereafter, the cancer reappeared, and Mr. Pena Gomez spent most of the rest of his life shuttling back and forth between Santo Domingo and New York, where he underwent medical treatment.

 In January, a factional dispute led him to jump back into the political arena in hopes that his personal popularity and fiery oratory would enable his party to make gains in the voting on May 16.

 Surviving are his wife, Peggy Cabral, and eight children and stepchildren.

 With his admirers converging on Santo Domingo from all corners of the country yesterday, the Dominican Government agreed that his body would be displayed at the national baseball stadium to accommodate the huge crowds that are expected.","Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a three-time candidate for President of the Dominican Republic who rose from a childhood of extreme poverty to become one of the most prominent black political figures in Latin America, died on Sunday night at his home outside Santo Domingo.","May 12, 1998, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final  Jose Pena Gomez, 61, Rare Black Dominican Figure, Dies"

 His nephew, Walker Taylor, recalled that a former U.S.G.A. president once told him that Mr. Grainger ""was the only person he knew who went to sleep every night reading the rules of golf. And he did.""

 Mr. Grainger was also president of Chemical Bank from 1956 to 1960. He was considered instrumental in developing the bank's retail network. In 1996, Chemical Bank merged with Chase Manhattan.

 Mr. Taylor said his uncle retired to Wilmington in the 1970's, but maintained an office in New York until his death, conducting business by calling his secretary several times a day. At the time of his death, Mr. Grainger was a director of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company and Smith Barney Managed Funds and was an adviser-director of the Union Electric Company of St. Louis.

 His business expertise, however, was probably overshadowed by his knowledge of and devotion to the game of golf.

 Mr. Grainger was chairman of the U.S.G.A. committee that in 1951 negotiated the first uniform code of rules with the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in Scotland, and reportedly assisted President Dwight D. Eisenhower with his short game at the White House.

 He was a chairman of the U.S.G.A. rules committee and vice chairman of the Augusta National Rules Committee.

 As president of the U.S.G.A., Mr. Grainger presented Arnold Palmer with his first amateur champion cup in 1954. He also served as president of the Metropolitan Golf Association and the United States Seniors' Golf Association.

 Born in Wilmington in 1895, Mr. Grainger attended Woodberry Forest School in Virginia and Princeton University in New Jersey.

 During World War I, he served on the home front as a captain of infantry and as an instructor in officers training schools at Fort Oglethorpe and Camp Gordon, both in Georgia.

 He later held executive positions with the Murchison National Bank in Wilmington, the North Carolina Bank and Trust Company of Greensboro and the Montclair Trust Company in New Jersey.

 He joined Chemical Bank in 1943 and served as president from 1956 to 1960, when he reached mandatory retirement age.

 Mr. Grainger was widowed when his wife of 70 years, Catherine, died in 1987.

 His survivors include two sons, Isaac B. Grainger Jr. of Charlotte and John Victor Grainger of Wilmington.

 In 1995 (the centennial year for both the association and Mr. Grainger), the U.S.G.A. designated the Ike Grainger Award to recognize people who have volunteered for the U.S.G.A. for 25 years.

1999-07-30 00:00:00,33032,"Phaidon Gizikis, a Greek general who as President of Greece played a key role in paving the way for the return of democracy after seven years of dictatorial rule, died on Monday at the Nimits military hospital in Athens. He was 82 and a longtime resident of Athens.

 The cause was not immediately disclosed, but Greek news media said his hospital stay was brief.

 Lieutenant General Gizikis was appointed President in late 1973, after an army coup, in which he had been a conspirator, overthrew President George Papadopoulos, a former army colonel. President Gizikis promoted himself to full general. The plan was for him to be only a figurehead. The real ruler of Greece was Brig. Dimitrios Ionnidis. But key military leaders turned against the brigadier and General Gizikis came to play his important part in the dictatorship's end.

 Mr. Papadopoulos had presided over a military dictatorship that had ruled Greece since 1967. In that year he had led an earlier military coup that ousted an unsteady parliamentary Government.

 In the summer of 1974, Greek officials said pressure built up within the military to go back to its barracks when it became obvious that the Government of Prime Minister Adamandios Androutsopoulos, a political nonentity who was appointed after the 1973 coup, could not respond effectively to growing economic problems and to a crisis that had arisen over Cyprus.

 Cabinet ministers in the civilian Government that supplanted the military in July 1974 said the prospect of war with Turkey over Cyprus had persuaded members of the junta that it was futile to carry on any longer. It was said that General Gizikis had realized that without a strong Government, Greece would not be able to negotiate effectively about Cyprus.

 He spoke by telephone with former Prime Minister Constantine Caramanlis, a civilian conservative who was in self-imposed exile in Paris, and asked him to return to Greece. Mr. Caramanlis hesitated. The President pledged to him that the civilians would acquire full control. Other junta members joined the President in the promise.

 Mr. Caramanlis returned, was sworn in as Prime Minister on July 24, 1974, and formed a new, center-right Government. Several of its members had been deported or jailed by the military rulers.

 By early August 1974, the relaxation of political life in Greece was already apparent. Political prisoners had been released, other exiles had returned. The far left, including adherents of Communist Party factions, was making its voice heard. The music of Mikis Theodorakis, the left-wing composer whom the military had expelled, was heard again in nightclubs and on the radio.

 After a new democratic coalition was put in place, General Gizikis stepped down as President in December 1974 and was succeeded by Michael Stassinopoulos. Later he retired from the army. In 1976 a military judicial council dropped proceedings against him and 88 other former officers charged with treason and mutiny for collaborating with the former junta.

 General Gizikis was born in western Greece, north of Athens, but reports differ as to his birthplace. He graduated from the Greek military academy in Athens in 1939.

 Surviving are his wife, two daughters and a son.

1999-06-22 00:00:00,40023,"Leonard Price Stavisky of Queens, a longtime Democratic legislator in Albany and an outspoken advocate of state support for public education, died Saturday in a hospital in Queens. He was 73 and lived in Whitestone, Queens.

 The cause was complications from a cerebral hemorrhage, said Senator Martin Connor, the leader of the Democratic minority in the State Senate.

 A former professor of history and government who held administrative office at various colleges for decades, Senator Stavisky made education the keynote of his 34 years in the New York State Assembly and Senate.

 ""He was an expert in the field of education,"" Senator Connor said, ""and fought tirelessly throughout his entire legislative career to insure that all of New York's children are provided with the opportunity to succeed.""

 Among his peers, Senator Stavisky, who represented Flushing, Queens, was respected as an expert on educational affairs and policies. In the Assembly, he served as chairman of the Education Committee for eight years and was a sponsor of the Stavisky-Goodman bill of 1975, which sought to prevent New York City's public schools from facing steep budget cuts in the wake of the city's fiscal crisis.

 As a member of the minority in the Senate, he was far less influential, but he continued to speak out about education. He was a champion of bilingual education, and conducted hearings on matters like tuitions, student-aid programs and the fiscal autonomy of the State University of New York.

 In the Senate, his committee assignments included memberships on the education, higher education, civil service and pensions committees.

 Leonard Stavisky was born in the Bronx and graduated from City College of New York in 1945. He received a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1946 and topped off his studies with a Columbia doctorate in political science in 1958.

 From 1945 to 1979 he taught history and political science and worked as an administrator at Colgate University, Long Island University, State University of New York, City University of New York, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University at Blacksburg, Va., among others. After that, until 1990, he was an adjunct professor of political science at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs.

 Mr. Stavisky earned his political spurs on the New York City Council from 1954 to 1960.

 He was elected to the State Assembly in 1966 and advanced to the Senate in 1983, first representing the old 12th District and, since 1994, the 16th as a Democrat-Liberal. In the 1970's he was a commissioner of the New York State Charter Revision Commission for New York City.

 He was a past commissioner of the Education Commission of the States, formed as an interstate liaison among governors, state legislators and educators. As such, he had a role in programs to improve educational practices in the United States and conduct training seminars for lawmakers and the makers of educational policies.

 Senator Stavisky is survived by his wife of 35 years, Toby Goldhaar Stavisky; and a son, Evan M., of Flushing.

He was 78 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.

 The cause was complications from pneumonia, said his daughter Nancy Doyle Palmer.

 Mr. Doyle worked for NBC televison in Washington and New York from 1946 to 1957. ""He was a very innovative craftsman as a producer and director"" of television news, said Reuven Frank, a former president of NBC News.

 He helped direct and produce ""The Huntley-Brinkley Report,"" the nightly newscast, from its beginning in October 1956.

 He also worked to organize and produce joint television news operations by ABC, CBS and NBC at eight presidential conventions, beginning in 1952, Mr. Frank said.

 Mr. Doyle also did some coaching of Presidents before they went before television news cameras at the White House. ""He was Harry Truman's favorite director,"" Mr. Frank said. ""As a pool producer and also when NBC was covering, he'd go down there and make sure the filming was done right.""

 ""The Eisenhower press conferences were not models of coherence,"" Mr. Frank continued, and so Mr. Doyle would study NBC's film of Mr. Eisenhower's responses to reporters' questions and then confer by phone with James Haggerty, Mr. Eisenhower's press secretary.

 ""It's not that Haggerty was censoring what we were putting together,"" Mr. Frank said. ""We were putting together pieces of film to make sure they made complete sentences,"" and Mr. Doyle ""didn't want Eisenhower to say what Eisenhower didn't say.""

 Mr. Doyle's later work included producing one-hour television specials for the National Geographic Society and owning and operating two radio stations and two cable systems. He won two Emmys and a Peabody Award, his family said.

 Born in Washington, he graduated in 1942 from Harvard College and was a Navy pilot in World War II.

 Besides his daughter, Ms. Palmer, of Washington, he is survived by his wife, Priscilla; another daughter, Diane Doyle, of Chevy Chase; a son, Robert, of Brooklyn; a sister, Marion Wade Campbell, of Richmond, Va.; and five grandchildren.

2000-10-01 00:00:00,6180,"Brian MacRae, who for 15 years was the Queen of England's personal bagpiper, died on Sept. 3. He was 58.

 The cause was a heart attack while he was on vacation in France, The Times of London said.

 Pipe-Major MacRae's principal duty, starting at precisely 9 a.m., was to play for 15 minutes under the window of Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle or Balmoral Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Scotland. Tradition required that he march up and down four times as he brought forth his instrument's eerie, inimitable sound.

 He also piped at the queen's dinner table, and was responsible for the 12 pipers who played around the table at state banquets.

 His daily duties did not end with the morning serenade. His next duty was to escort the queen from her private quarters to her first appointment of the day. He also served as page of the presence, responsible for meeting and escorting the queen's visitors, including the prime minister and ambassadors, to the Grand Entrance of Buckingham Palace.

 ""His expert playing, composing skills and cheerfulness earned him his coveted post,"" The Daily Mail newspaper reported. ""Once, as a birthday treat, he woke the queen on the Royal Train with one of his familiar medleys.""

 Brian MacRae was born in Aberdeen on March 27, 1942. His grandfather and father played the pipes, and he began to play at 6. The Times of London reported that his father insisted that he learn a trade so he apprenticed as a yacht builder and cabinetmaker.

 He joined the army at 18, serving with the Royal Engineers. He transferred to the Gordon Highlanders two years later. He rose from piper to pipe-major in nine years on the strength of his virtuosity and skill at composing. But his duties extended beyond music: he commanded his drummers and pipers as a rifle platoon in Northern Ireland in 1976.

 He was selected to be the queen's piper in 1980. He was the ninth person to fill the position since Queen Victoria first heard bagpipes when she and Prince Albert visited the Scottish Highlands for the first time in 1842 and the queen declared, in a letter to her mother: ""I must have a piper.""

 Pipe-Major MacRae became particularly known as a composer for the bagpipe. His ""Cannongate"" strathspey, a Scottish dance a bit slower than the reel, won the Scottish Division competition in 1976. When Prince Charles visited the Gordons as their colonel in chief in 1978, he was greeted by ""Prince Charles March,"" composed by Pipe-Major MacRae.

 A reel he wrote the same year, called ""The Tache"" and dedicated to his commander, was said to be ""probably the best new reel since the war"" by the piper and critic Archie Kenneth, according to The Times.

 He retired as the queen's piper at 52, because of Army retirement policies, and played at weddings and funerals afterward. He is survived by his wife, Joan, and daughters, Fiona and Helen.

 At a private observance at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle that preceded his private funeral, The Mail reported, a band of pipers struck up ""Lord Lovat's Lament"" as his coffin was carried to the hearse.

2000-02-11 00:00:00,28636,"Ion Gheorghe Maurer, who was prime minister, foreign minister and titular head of state of independent-minded Communist Romania from the 1950's to the 1970's, died Tuesday in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, where he lived. He was 97.

 Mr. Maurer, whose name is pronounced yon gay-OR-gay MAO-rer, came from a middle-class background, was trained as a lawyer, and became a longtime Communist and a member of the Romanian Politburo.

 Mr. Maurer, who had joined the then-illegal Communist Party in 1936, was elected prime minister in 1961 by Romania's Grand National Assembly and held the post until 1974. As prime minister he was the country's second-ranking Communist, after the party leader, Nicolae Ceausescu.

 Both men sought the greatest possible freedom of action inside the Soviet bloc. That sometimes led to disagreements with the Soviets.

 As prime minister, and earlier, Mr. Maurer was closely involved in forming his country's foreign policy. He also repeatedly sought to play a conciliatory role in the ideological rift between the Soviet Union and China, which grew more and more acerbic beginning in the early 1960's.

 In 1974, the official Romanian press agency, Agerpres, reported that he asked to be released from the premiership for reasons of age -- he was 71 -- and health. He had been badly hurt when his jeep flipped during a hunting trip in 1970. When he was 75, he withdrew from politics without saying why.

 Mr. Maurer had a brief stint as his country's appointed foreign minister in 1957 and 1958. Then, early in 1958, he was elected chairman of the presidium of the Grand National Assembly. He held that post, and was ex officio head of state, until 1961.

 He was a teacher's son, a native of Bucharest and partly of German descent. After receiving his law degree from the University of Bucharest, he did legal work for years for Mr. Ceausescu and other Communists and also for banks. He spent time in jail because of his Communist views, but after Romania acquired a Communist-led coalition government in 1945 and was proclaimed a Communist people's republic in 1947, he rose to hold various party and government posts before becoming foreign minister.

 An early marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Elena Stanescu, died last year.

 He is survived by a son, Jan, and a daughter.

2000-01-25 00:00:00,28556,"Bob Squier, one of the originators of modern political imagery and a close friend and adviser of Vice President Al Gore, died today after a six-month battle with colon cancer. He was 65 and lived in Millwood, Va.

 Mr. Squier brought his background as a documentary filmmaker with a fascination with American literary figures to his path-breaking role as political manipulator and marketer. His advertisements, always for Democrats, were marked by sharp-edged wit and a direct approach that contrasted with the gauzy morning-in-America style.

 His clients included Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and President Clinton and Mr. Gore in 1992 and 1996. He worked on dozens of Senate and governor contests and compiled a win-loss record envied by his competitors.

 ""His loyalty, talent and, above all, his perseverance helped Vice President Gore and me craft a winning re-election campaign when many had counted us out,"" President Clinton said today. ""I owe him much.""

 Mr. Squier trained many of today's most prominent political consultants and was one of the first celebrity political advisers, winning a steady spot as a commentator on the NBC's ""Today"" program in the 1980's.

 ""He was a pioneer in this business of political communications,"" said Bill Knapp, a partner of Mr. Squier in the consulting firm Squier Knapp Dunn. ""He helped create the modern campaign, for better or for worse.""

 Many of the legends of late-20th century politics were captured in Mr. Squier's camera and transformed into a form of visual persuasion that defines political speech in the modern era.

 Mr. Squier filmed a young politician named Bob Graham as he spent a day working as a teacher, a laborer, a farmer and an egg-packer to convince Florida voters that he was a regular guy who understood their concerns. They rewarded him with the governorship and, later, a seat in the United States Senate.

 Mr. Squier also captured dozens of Mr. Gore's town meetings in Tennessee, turning them into a record of contact with voters that propelled Mr. Gore into the Senate and the vice presidency.

 As the 1990's dawned and a younger crowd of consultants was making its mark in politics, some Democrats whispered that Mr. Squier had lost his edge. But Mr. Gore stuck with him and used him as a consultant in the 1992 presidential campaign.

 His advertisements for the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1996 visually linked the Republican nominee Bob Dole to the unpopular Speaker Newt Gingrich and buried the Dole campaign before it had a chance to get off the ground.

 ""It was the first time paid advertising made a decisive difference in a presidential campaign,"" said Ronald Klain, Mr. Gore's former chief of staff.

 Although he had worked with Mr. Gore almost from the beginning of the vice president's political career, Mr. Squier's role in the Gore campaign sharply diminished last summer after Mr. Gore brought in Carter Eskew as a top adviser.

 Mr. Eskew and Mr. Squier had a bitter and well-publicized falling out in 1992 and refused to work together -- or even speak to each other. But Mr. Gore continued to quietly seek Mr. Squier's counsel until illness incapacitated Mr. Squier a few weeks ago, aides said.

 Mr. Eskew, who remains on the Gore campaign as senior media strategist, said Mr. Squier was an innovator to whom American politics owes a large debt.

 ""Bob understood that campaigns were dialogues and that a lot of that dialogue takes place through advertising,"" Mr. Eskew said. ""I had some obvious differences with him professionally but I had the greatest times of my life with him as well.""

 Another Squier partner, Anita Dunn, is the chief communications consultant in the campaign of Mr. Gore's Democratic rival, former Senator Bill Bradley.

 Mr. Squier was born in Brainard, Minn., on Sept. 21, 1934, and reared in Minneapolis. He was a top high school and collegiate swimmer and set a National Collegiate Athletic Association record for the butterfly when the stroke was still accompanied by a frog-kick, rather than the current dolphinlike method of propulsion.

 He studied communications at the University of Minnesota and learned documentary filmmaking there and then at the public television stations WGBH in Boston and KLRN in Austin, Tex.

 Mr. Squier made documentaries about President Lyndon B. Johnson after the Kennedy assassination and filmed award-winning biographies of Herman Melville and William Faulkner before turning his transforming eye toward electoral politics.

 His sons by his first marriage, Robert Squier and Mark Squier, followed their father into the business of political persuasion. Mark is a partner in a political consulting firm; Robert is a professional musician who produces music tracks for commercial films and political advertisements.

 Mr. Squier is also survived by his wife, Prudence, and three grandchildren.

 He died at his farm in the Virginia horse country west of Washington where he tended a garden and a small vineyard. Although Mr. Squier was a collector of art, a connoisseur of first-class travel and something of a clothes horse, he could not master his little vineyard, Mr. Knapp said.

 ""He planted it, hoed it, watered it,"" Mr. Knapp said, ""and produced some of the worst wine imaginable.""

 His body was crushed in the accident, which took place at the construction site where he worked in West Palm Beach, the news agency said.

 Mr. Smith's suave sound became familiar to disco fans before he joined K. C. and the Sunshine Band, when he played the signature riff on George McRae's ""Rock Your Baby."" He was soon invited by the production team of Harry Wayne Casey (also known as K. C.) and Richard Finch to join the Sunshine Band.

 ""Armed only with her faith, she taught gangs in New York City to solve their differences without violence,"" President Clinton said in a statement last week. ""In Puerto Rico, her community service centers, the Centros Isolina Ferre, transformed ravaged neighborhoods by operating clinics and helping residents to empower themselves.""

 Sister Isolina won the Medal of Freedom, the highest honor the government can give a civilian, for establishing charitable centers in New York City and Appalachia, in addition to Puerto Rico.

 A friend and fellow nun in Sister Isolina's order, the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity, said that Sister Isolina successfully mediated a conflict between warring Puerto Rican youth gangs in Brooklyn in the 1950's and 60's while she was the director of a Catholic charitable center there.

 The friend said Sister Isolina's success as a peacemaker was the result of her interpersonal skills, her training in sociology at Fordham and the insights provided by her Puerto Rican heritage.

 She also worked with Portuguese immigrants in New England and black youths in Brooklyn.

 She won a Rockefeller Public Service Award in 1980 for her work in revitalizing communities and neighborhoods and organizing local groups to serve the unemployed, underskilled, delinquent, sick and handicapped.

 Sister Isolina was born into a Puerto Rican family that owns two leading newspapers. Her brother, Luis, was a governor of Puerto Rico, and established the ruling New Progressive Party. She employed her family's influence in establishing charitable organizations.

 In 1935, while on a trip to Havana, she decided to join the Missionary Servants of the Most Blessed Trinity. She studied at St. Joseph College for Women and at Fordham University. Her work in Puerto Rico included founding a vocational school in Ponce.

 She is survived by her brother.

2001-11-02 00:00:00,53333,"Juan Bosch, a prolific writer who in December 1962 became the first freely elected president of the Dominican Republic in 38 years -- only to be toppled by a military coup after seven months in office -- died yesterday in the capital, Santo Domingo. He was 92.

 At its start, Mr. Bosch's presidency appeared to promise a more hopeful future for his impoverished and deeply troubled country. His election had been made possible by the assassination in May 1961 of Gen. Rafael L. Trujillo, the dictator who had ruled since 1930. That also let the Organization of American States lift sanctions imposed on the country in 1960 because of General Trujillo's complicity in a plot to assassinate President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela.

 The Kennedy administration welcomed Mr. Bosch's election and sent Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson to represent the United States at his inauguration in February 1963. Washington also promised increased aid under the Alliance for Progress.

 But Mr. Bosch quickly provoked his rightist opponents, introducing constitutional changes that included limiting the size of landholdings and strengthening industrial and agricultural workers' rights.

 His performance as president had other problems, too. Caught between the remnants of General Trujillo's forces and Communists inspired by Fidel Castro, he often appeared indecisive and unable to delegate responsibility. In his book ""Overtaken by Events,"" John Bartlow Martin, who was the American ambassador in Santo Domingo, described Mr. Bosch as ""a poor president.""

 On Sept. 25, a group of military officers and other enemies of the government led by Generals Elias Wessin y Wessin and Antonio Imbert Barreras ousted Mr. Bosch and his cabinet. The plotters called them ""corrupt and pro-Communist."" Mr. Bosch went into exile in Puerto Rico.

 The United States reacted angrily, suspending aid and refusing to recognize the triumvirate that emerged from the coup and was replaced by a cabal headed by Donald Cabal Reid, a prominent businessman.

 In 1965, military supporters of Mr. Bosch conducted an uprising in the capital, demanding the restoration of the exiled president and a return to the Constitution of 1963. In April, Mr. Johnson warned Mr. Bosch not to return to the Dominican Republic. That month, the United States sent 22,000 marines to occupy the capital for several months while a provisional government was formed and elections were arranged.

 Mr. Bosch returned to contest the elections in June 1966 but lost to Joaquin Balaguer, a former ally of General Trujillo. Mr. Bosch contested elections in 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1994, always losing.

 Juan Bosch Gavino was born on June 30, 1909, in La Vega to a Spanish father and a Puerto Rican mother. After college in Santo Domingo, he began writing and published more than 30 works of fiction and history. In 1937, appalled by a massacre of Haitian squatters ordered by General Trujillo, he began a 24-year exile, initially moving to Cuba.

 In 1939, he helped found the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano, with a leftist non-Communist orientation. In 1952, he fled Cuba after Gen. Fulgencio Batista took power and threatened to deport him to the Dominican Republic. Mr. Bosch returned to his homeland in 1961 after General Trujillo's death and built his party into a movement of farm and factory workers.

 In the 1962 election campaign, he made his followers extravagant promises that were probably unrealizable, including jobs for the unemployed, the division and distribution of big estates to landless farm workers, better housing and higher living standards.

 He was so eager to resist being called a Communist that when a Spanish Jesuit accused him of that, he withdrew from the election for a while after failing to have the contest postponed to give himself time to reply. Two days before Election Day, Mr. Bosch rejoined the contest and won.

 In 1941, he married the former Carmen Quidiello, a Cuban. They have a son, Patricio, and a daughter, Barbara.","Juan Bosch, a prolific writer who in December 1962 became the first freely elected president of the Dominican Republic in 38 years -- only to be toppled by a military coup after seven months in office -- died yesterday in the capital, Santo Domingo.","The New York Times                              November 2, 2001 Friday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Juan Bosch, 92, Freely Elected Dominican President, Dies"
2001-07-06 00:00:00,46918,"Hannelore Kohl, the wife of Germany's former chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has committed suicide and left letters saying she wanted to end her suffering from a long illness, the authorities said today. She was 68.

 Her body was found today at the family's home in the western city of Ludwigshafen, Rhineland-Palatinate state officials said. The method of suicide was not disclosed.

 Mrs. Kohl had suffered for seven years from a painful sunlight allergy that forced her to spend the last 15 months of her life at the family's home ""without any daylight,"" a statement from Mr. Kohl's private office said. She was also taking strong painkillers, it said.

 Her allergy was caused by a penicillin treatment in 1993. Doctors in Germany and abroad could not alleviate the extremely rare ailment, the statement said.

 ""Due to the hopelessness of her health situation, she decided to end her life of her own free will,"" the statement said. ""She conveyed this decision in farewell letters to her husband, her sons and friends.""

 Mr. Kohl made no immediate comment.

 Mrs. Kohl. who married the future chancellor in 1960, had virtually disappeared from public view since her husband's election defeat three years ago, though she supported him during a slush fund scandal that threatened his reputation as the leader who reunited Germany.

 She stood firmly by her husband's side during his long political career. With her coifed blond hair and blazers, she was a trim and elegant presence. Still, one of her foremost goals was keeping herself and the couple's two sons out of the public spotlight.

 Trained as a interpreter of English and French, she led a charity for helping accident victims, the Hannelore Kohl Foundation. A few years ago, she wrote a cookbook with her husband that extolled the heavy German fare he loves.

 In May, she was so ill that she had to skip the wedding of her son Peter to his Turkish fiancee in Istanbul.

 Mrs. Kohl was born on March 7, 1933, in Berlin, the daughter of an engineer from Rhineland-Palatinate. She grew up in the eastern city of Leipzig until the end of World War II in 1945, when the family moved west.

 She is survived by the former chancellor and their sons.","Hannelore Kohl, the wife of Germany's former chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has committed suicide and left letters saying she wanted to end her suffering from a long illness, the authorities said today.","The New York Times                                July 6, 2001 Friday                               Late Edition - Final  Hannelore Kohl, 68, Ex-Chancellor's Wife; a Suicide After Illness"
2001-05-24 00:00:00,58578,"Philip W. Buchen, a lawyer who in 1974 first laid plans for Gerald R. Ford to succeed Richard M. Nixon as president and then worked on legal aspects of President Ford's decision to pardon Nixon, died on May 21 at his home in Washington. He was 85.

 The cause was pneumonia, his family said.

 One evening in early April 1974 as the Watergate crisis moved toward its climax, Mr. Buchen, a friend and former law partner of Vice President Ford as well as a member of his staff, came to dinner at the home of Clay T. Whitehead, a Nixon White House aide, and surprised his host by saying: ""We have to do some planning for Jerry. We have to face the fact the president may resign.""

 Mr. Whitehead, apparently concerned about Nixon's mental condition, agreed and called in three trusted friends: Jonathan Moore, a former assistant to Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson; Lawrence Lynn, an assistant secretary of the interior; and Brian Lamb, one of his own assistants.

 As the Watergate storm worsened, the group worked in secrecy for three months, reading up on the transition of power in 1945, when Harry S. Truman ascended to the presidency upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt and making plans for Mr. Ford's first days in office.

 At dinner on Aug. 6 that year, Mr. Buchen revealed these preparations to an astonished Mr. Ford, according to an account by James Cannon in ""Time and Chance: Gerald Ford's Appointment with History"" (HarperCollins). Mr. Ford said that if word of the preparations had become public, he would have been accused of disloyalty to the president.

 In fact, the end of the Watergate ordeal was already at hand. On that same day, Nixon told his chief of staff, Alexander M. Haig, that he would resign, and Mr. Ford independently ordered aides to start writing a speech for him to deliver upon taking office.

 Mr. Buchen, who was appointed White House counsel with a seat in the cabinet shortly after President Ford took office on Aug. 9, 1974, immediately found himself at the center of the controversy about whether to pardon Nixon and what to do about his presidential papers and documents, including the Oval Office tapes that had brought him down.

 In his autobiography ""A Time to Heal"" (Harper & Row), President Ford recalled how he secretly raised the possibility of pardoning Nixon with five aides: Mr. Buchen, Mr. Haig, Henry A. Kissinger, Robert Hartman and Jack Marsh.

 ""Buchen, I knew already, was inclined to favor the idea,"" he wrote, adding that Mr. Haig and Mr. Kissinger also supported it.

 Mr. Cannon gives a slightly different account, quoting Mr. Buchen as saying of President Ford, ""I could see that he had already made up his mind, and it was my job to find out how he could do it, rather than whether he should do it.""

 Mr. Buchen convinced President Ford that he had the authority to pardon Nixon before the former president was indicted for any crimes. He was involved in negotiating the agreement with Nixon's lawyers for sharing ownership of his presidential papers and tapes.

 But Mr. Buchen never obtained the full confession of guilt in the Watergate case that he had recommended President Ford seek from Nixon in return for a pardon, though he argued that by accepting the pardon Nixon had implicitly admitted guilt.

 Though the pardon set off a firestorm of criticism and was credited with helping Mr. Ford lose the 1976 presidential election, it has come to be regarded more evenhandedly. Earlier this week, Mr. Ford was honored for issuing the pardon by the John F. Kennedy Library with its Profile in Courage award.

 Born in Sheboygan, Wis., on Feb. 17, 1916, Mr. Buchen had polio as a boy and thereafter walked with a cane. He studied law at the University of Michigan, where he met Mr. Ford, later setting up a law office with him in Grand Rapids, Mich.

 A first marriage ended in divorce; he is survived by his second wife, the former Beatrice Loomis; their son, Roderick, of Tampa, Fla.; and a stepdaughter, Victoria Aler of Scottsdale, Ariz.","Philip W.

 Mr. Crowell joined Thomas Y. Crowell, the first American publisher of Tolstoy and Gogol, as a sales representative in 1931, moving up the ranks until he became president and treasurer in 1937. During his career, he was known for his special interest in publishing reference books, which included Roget's International Thesaurus and The Reader's Encyclopedia.

 When HarperCollins acquired the company in 1978, Mr. Crowell stepped down as president and served as a consultant. In 1980, he retired to Newfane, Vt., where he was a benefactor of the Moore Free Library.

 The company, which started as a book bindery, began publishing books in 1876 when Mr. Crowell's grandfather, Thomas Young Crowell, started his own publishing branch of the Boston bookbinder. The bindery was closed in 1920 and the company became a publisher exclusively.

 Outside the company, Mr. Crowell was a director of the American Book Publishing Council, a member of the United States Information Agency's advisory committee and a director of the Yale University Press.

 An avid conservationist and benefactor, Mr. Crowell donated tracts of land in Vermont and Maine to Yale and the Nature Conservancy.

2001-04-02 00:00:00,58351,"Stanley H. Ruttenberg, a union organizer and consultant for more than 40 years who was an assistant secretary of labor in the Johnson administration, died on Wednesday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 84.

 Drawn to the trade union movement as a young man, Mr. Ruttenberg later became an economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. before working for the federal government.

 W. Willard Wirtz, the secretary of labor with whom Mr. Ruttenberg served, said Mr. Ruttenberg knew how to combine fiscal policies with ""a program of hands-on job training.""

 In the mid-1960's, Mr. Wirtz recalled, Mr. Ruttenberg helped to eliminate widespread racial discrimination in state employment offices. At that time, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited discrimination in federally financed programs and directed government agencies to enforce that policy in the programs they administered.

 The federal government at that time financed the United States Employment Service, established in 1933, but states operated the agency's local offices.

 Mr. Ruttenberg, who was directing the Labor Department's enforcement of Title VI, sent 10 teams around the country to investigate nearly 50 complaints of discrimination and other suspicious situations.

 While urging voluntary compliance, Mr. Ruttenberg made it clear that he was prepared to cut off employment service money to any state that refused to comply with the law. Some offices changed their practices.

 In a newspaper interview at the time, Mr. Ruttenberg said change would come slowly because racial discrimination had such deep roots.

 ""You don't break that thing overnight,"" he said.

 Stanley Harvey Ruttenberg was born in St. Paul , on March 19, 1917. He grew up in Nemacolin, Pa., and attended the Massanutten Military Academy in Woodstock, Va. He earned a bachelor of science degree at the University of Pittsburgh.

 As a child, Mr. Ruttenberg recalled, he developed a lifetime dedication to the trade union movement when he stirred the soup pot for striking coal miners and heard them talk about their discontent.

 In the 1930's, Mr. Ruttenberg was a union organizer in Cincinnati, Chicago and other Midwestern cities.

 In World War II, he served as a first lieutenant in the Army on Okinawa.

 Prominent as a union economist in the 1950's, Mr. Ruttenberg became head of the research department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

 In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Mr. Ruttenberg as a special assistant to the secretary of labor. Five years later, the president named him to succeed Daniel Patrick Moynihan as assistant secretary of labor for manpower.

 After six years in the Labor Department, Mr. Ruttenberg became a consultant, establishing himself as Stanley H. Ruttenberg & Associates in Washington, where he helped clients win federal contracts. He retired in 1982.

2002-03-22 00:00:00,56412,"Former Senator Herman E. Talmadge, an old-fashioned Southern populist who built schools as governor of Georgia and then called for stopping desegregation by closing them, died today at his Hampton, Ga., home. He was 88.

 Mr. Talmadge, a Democrat who was elected governor twice, lost his bid for a fifth term in the Senate in 1980 when he could not keep up with changes in the Georgia electorate and in political standards in Washington.

 Like his father, Eugene Talmadge, a three-term governor who boasted that he never carried a county with a streetcar line, Herman Talmadge concentrated on rural areas. As he wrote in ""Talmadge,"" his 1987 autobiography, ""The farmers had supported me in every race I ever ran, including the last one, but there just weren't enough of them left.""

 He was swamped in the Atlanta area by Mack Mattingly, the first Republican to win a Georgia Senate seat since Reconstruction. Mr. Mattingly enjoyed strong support from black voters, whose leaders recalled that when Mr. Talmadge first ran for the Senate in 1956 he proclaimed ""God advocates segregation.""

 His defeat was made possible by a messy divorce in 1978, a public bout with alcoholism in 1979 and a Senate ethics investigation of a sort that would never have happened when he was first elected. The Senate voted in 1979 to denounce him for ""reprehensible"" official finances -- padding of his expense accounts.

 Before the troubles of his final term, he was a quiet but important member of the Senate, overshadowed for some years by Richard B. Russell, Georgia's senior senator until his death in 1971, and then to a degree by Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana, whom he ranked just behind on the Finance Committee. Mr. Talmadge was not a colorful orator like many other Southerners, but he chewed tobacco and was probably the last senator to use a spittoon while presiding over the Senate.

 As chairman of the Agriculture Committee, he pushed through the Rural Development Act of 1972 to promote jobs and infrastructure in rural areas. He also helped expand the food stamp and school lunch programs. That was consistent with his record as governor from 1948 to 1955, said Charles S. Bullock III, a University of Georgia political scientist. ""There was a populist streak,"" Mr. Bullock said. ""He built more schools and roads than most governors.""

 Mr. Talmadge could afford that spending because he got the Legislature to pass a sales tax after campaigning against it.

 While he denounced the 1954 Supreme Court decision on school desegregation -- saying ""there aren't enough troops in the whole United States to make the white people of this state send their children to school with colored children"" -- he also saw to it that black teachers' salaries were made equal to those of whites, a step for which there was no political support.

 Senator Zell Miller, whom Mr. Talmadge defeated in a bitter runoff for the Democratic nomination in 1980, told the Senate today that Mr. Talmadge ""was Georgia's greatest governor of the 20th century.""

 Herman Eugene Talmadge was born on Aug. 9, 1913, the son of Eugene Talmadge and Mattie Thurmond Talmadge. He grew up on a farm and graduated from the University of Georgia in 1936. He entered the Navy as an ensign in 1941 and was discharged in 1945 as a lieutenant commander.

 In 1947, Mr. Talmadge served as governor for 67 days, though the Georgia Supreme Court would later rule he had not been the actual governor. He had taken over after his father, a strident racist, died after being re-elected in 1946, but before being sworn in. The son, who ran his father's campaign, devised a strategy to have the Legislature make him governor. Under the state Constitution, the Legislature could choose between the top two candidates if neither had a majority. The younger Mr. Talmadge got into the running by producing several hundred write-in votes, many with obvious irregularities, and the Legislature voted to make him governor.

 That period was known as the time of the three governors in Georgia: Herman Talmadge; Ellis Arnall, the outgoing governor who refused to leave; and M. E. Thompson, who had been elected lieutenant governor and claimed he was Eugene Talmadge's rightful successor.

 The State Supreme Court agreed, making Mr. Thompson governor until a special election in 1948, which Mr. Talmadge won. He won a full four-year term in 1950.

 In the Senate, he was known for the un-senatorial behavior of starting his committee meetings on time.

 He was also chosen for membership on the seven-member special Senate committee that investigated the Watergate scandal. Samuel Dash, the committee's chief counsel, said today, ""His questioning was among the best.""

 One of his best-known exchanges was with John D. Ehrlichman, a top Nixon aide. Mr. Ehrlichman was defending, on grounds of national security, his decision to order a break-in to obtain the psychiatric records of Daniel Ellsberg, who has said he gave The New York Times the secret Pentagon papers on the government's conduct of the Vietnam War.

 On July 25, 1973, Mr. Talmadge asked Mr. Ehrlichman, ""Do you remember when we were in law school we studied a famous principle of law that came from England and also is well known in this country, that no matter how humble a man's cottage is, that even the King of England cannot enter without his consent?""

 Mr. Ehrlichman shot back, ""I am afraid that has been considerably eroded over the years, has it not?""

 Mr. Talmadge got an ovation when he replied, ""Down in my country, we still think it is a pretty legitimate principle of law.""

 One other major step Mr. Talmadge took in the Senate, recalled today in Atlanta as ""heroic"" by former President Jimmy Carter, was to vote for the Panama Canal treaties in 1978, which ceded control of the canal to Panamanian sovereignty.

 Mr. Carter said Mr. Talmadge acknowledged that the vote ""was almost politically suicidal."" But, he said, the senator supported him as a fellow Georgian, and ""and because it was the right thing to do.""

 Mr. Talmadge is survived by his wife, Lynda Cowert Talmadge of Hampton; a son, Herman Eugene Talmadge of Lovejoy, Ga,; a stepson, David Pierce of Brunswick, Ga.; nine grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

 One reason Mr. Talmadge never had a serious contest until 1980 was unfailing attention to constituents. A former aide, Daniel Tate, said today that Mr. Talmadge required ""every letter from Georgia had to be responded to or at least acknowledged within 24 hours of receipt.""

 Mr. Tate, now a Washington lobbyist, recalled being reprimanded for getting behind on the mail. In defense, he said, ""Senator, the letters still on my desk really should not be answered at all. Each is from a nut.""

 Mr. Talmadge replied: ""Every constituent, including those you think of as nuts, expects and deserves a response from his United States senator.""

 Then the senator said, ""Just remember, nuts vote. And if you lose the nut vote, you'll lose the election.""","Former Senator Herman E.

2002-10-07 00:00:00,37014,"Prince Claus von Amsberg, husband of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, died tonight in Amsterdam after a long illness. He was 76.

 The Dutch prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, said the cause of death was pneumonia. The prince's health had declined in recent years, owing to Parkinson's disease.

 Speaking of the German-born aristocrat, Mr. Balkenende said in a televised address: ""Prince Claus committed himself to Dutch society with strength, seriousness, dedication and, when appropriate, with humor. We owe him our respect and thanks for standing by the side of our Queen.""

 Prince Claus became a beloved figure in the Netherlands after a stormy start. Many Dutch objected to the royal marriage in 1966 because as a teenager he had briefly been a member of the Hitler Youth and was later in the Wehrmacht during World War II, when Germany occupied the Netherlands for five years. The wedding of the handsome German diplomat and Princess Beatrix was marred by smoke bombs and violent protests outside the palace.

 But Prince Claus worked to turn the tide. He denounced the Nazi regime, learned perfect Dutch, fathered three sons -- including the first male heir to the throne in nearly a century -- and became involved in development work.

 With his unassuming and witty style, he gradually became the most popular member of the royal family, as confirmed by repeated opinion polls. Many Dutch said that he gave a more human face to the rather formal and often distant Dutch queen.

 ""He was a man of substance, although it was sometimes difficult for him to find the right role,"" said Andre Spoor, a former newspaper editor and a long-time friend of the prince's. ""Behind the scenes he worked hard to build bridges between the Dutch and the Germans because relations continued to be tense until well into the 1980's. He would bring people from both sides together for meals and press them to debate and air their grievances.""

 Prince Claus was born Sept. 6, 1926, and grew up in Tanzania on his parents' sisal plantation. He was later drafted into the German army but did not fight.

 After Beatrix was crowned queen, he sometimes spoke privately of the constraints of royal life and of being prince consort. ""We live in a glass house,"" he would tell his friends.

 He also expressed doubt about the future of the monarchy. ""He once told me: I think we'll be the last ones. A hereditary monarchy does not really have a place in a modern democracy,"" Mr. Spoor said.

 But he was usually contradicted by Dutch friends and opinion polls indicating that the Dutch are quite attached to their monarchy. His oldest son, crown Prince Willem-Alexander is in line to become the next king.

 One story often told concerned the ""neck tie incident."" At a ceremony in 1998 he rose to the podium and invited all the men in the room to strip off their ties -- ""that chain around your neck"" -- and lay them before the queen. From then on, ties were no longer required at the palace.

 In addition to his wife and the crown prince, Prince Claus is survived by five sisters and two other sons, Johan Friso and Constantijn.","Prince Claus von Amsberg, husband of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, died tonight in Amsterdam after a long illness.","The New York Times                               October 7, 2002 Monday                               Late Edition - Final  Claus von Amsberg, 76, Popular Dutch Prince"

 Mr. Tassie, who spent 35 years with the company, which is in Lawrenceville, led it as chief executive from 1959 to 1977. He retired as a director and chairman of its finance committee in 1980. (Lenox is now a subsidiary of the Brown-Forman Corporation of Louisville.)

 Lenox was founded in 1889 by Walter Scott Lenox as a ceramic art studio in Trenton. It was chosen in 1918 to supply the china for formal White House dinners and has created elegant table settings for presidents, vice presidents and American ambassadors abroad ever since.

 Under Mr. Tassie, the company broadened its sights through market research, advertising and its first national sales force. The Lenox brand grew into a family standby for quality home products, jewelry, gifts and collectibles. Its line now includes flatware and leather goods, like business cases.

 Formerly a family-owned craft operation, Lenox expanded to 14 subsidiaries and increased its market share, particularly in fine china. It joined the Fortune 1000, and Mr. Tassie took the company public in 1963. (It now has 4,000 employees and produces $550 million in annual sales.)

 John Tassie, a native Californian, graduated from Princeton in 1939. He joined Lenox as an assistant plant manager in 1942, when the company turned to war production with its translucent ivory china, which proved ideal for ship instrumentation. Its craftsmen developed an even tougher ceramic, Lenoxite, for the military's insulators and resistors, and for other uses in radar and electronics.

 Mr. Tassie was promoted to general manager in 1943. He became executive vice president in 1948, president and chief executive in 1959, and chairman and C.E.O. in 1974, the positions he held until 1977.

2002-12-24 00:00:00,37334,"Harvey B. Scribner, a no-nonsense former teacher from Maine who went on to become the chancellor of New York City's school system as it underwent a turbulent shift toward local control in the early 1970's, died yesterday in Waterville, Me. He was 88.

 Dr. Scribner arrived in New York after two decades as a teacher and administrator in Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont and New Jersey, compiling a record of innovation and gentlemanly leadership.

 As state education commissioner in Vermont in the late 60's, Dr. Scribner advocated greater local control of schools and became known for emphasizing the basics in the classroom and continuing education for teachers. He was an early advocate of giving students academic credit for community service. As superintendent in Teaneck, N.J., he oversaw efforts to preserve integration in the township's schools.

 But he later acknowledged that nothing could have prepared him for the tumultuous political and educational environment in New York. Years of racial and economic stress in the city's growing black and Hispanic neighborhoods resulted in protests during his tenure in support of local control of the schools, a notion supported by Mayor John V. Lindsay, who later paid a political price as the schools began to slip.

 The State Legislature responded to the upheaval by decentralizing control of the school system. In 1969, it empowered 32 community school districts throughout the city to administer elementary and middle schools. High schools remained under the control of the central Board of Education. But the board, too, was reconstituted, with its five members appointed by the city's borough presidents instead of by the mayor.

 A superintendent of schools, wielding broad authority over the entire system, was replaced by a chancellor who directly administered only high schools and support services, like budgeting, special education and career education.

 On paper, the chancellor could suspend, supersede or remove community school board members for failing to live up to regulations. In reality, his power was limited. Dr. Scribner found himself hamstrung by the racial and political strife, as well as by the dispersion of power under decentralization, the very system he advocated.

 When Dr. Scribner took office in July 1970, he was the last hope of a school board that had searched for a chancellor for more than a year and had been turned down by at least 10 candidates, including Ramsey Clark, Cyrus R. Vance and R. Sargent Shriver. Upon taking office, Dr. Scribner expressed great enthusiasm for taking over the nation's largest school system at a critical time.

 But years later, Dr. Scribner, who resigned after nearly three years, expressed great disappointment, blaming the Board of Education, which he believed was never committed to making local control work, for the school system's problems.

 ""I don't think decentralization ever was set up to work,"" he was quoted as saying in Newsday in 1988. In that interview, he said the community school boards and districts just added another layer of bureaucracy. ""What I'm talking about is letting each building make its own decisions,"" he said.

 As public schools leader in New York City, he had little control over the system that he had been asked to oversee. From the first few weeks to the last few days of his short tenure, from 1970 to 1973, Dr. Scribner's lack of power manifested itself in many ways.

 During his first months in office, the central Board of Education made many personnel and budgetary decisions without Dr. Scribner's input, in meetings the board barred him from attending.

 In his first year, Dr. Scribner appointed commissions to examine claims that admissions exams at the city's top high schools were biased against black and Hispanic students. But high school administrators revolted and were able to persuade the State Legislature to pass a law that blocked Dr. Scribner from making any changes.

 Many in central administration and the local schools came to view him as a hard-charging outsider who was passionate about issues, but lacking in the political skills needed to navigate the tortuous bureaucracy of the school system, teachers' unions and municipal government.

 The powerful president of the United Federation of Teachers, Albert Shanker, said at the time that he respected Dr. Scribner, but that the chancellor's desire to hold teachers to performance standards essentially suggested that they were to blame for the system's problems. Dr. Scribner was also critical of the tenure rules that enabled teachers to hold their jobs for life, regardless of their performance. Mr. Shanker, who carried much political weight, was one of the chief opponents to renewing the chancellor's contract.

 Dr. Scribner found himself engulfed in racial politics as well. He was still dealing with problems that arose from the racial tension in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville district in Brooklyn, which was turned over to residents of the predominantly black neighborhoods in 1968 as an experiment. Teachers' unions organized a citywide strike that year after the district board, its membership mostly black, tried to transfer several white teachers involuntarily. In his final report on the matter, Dr. Scribner concluded that the union was trying to get in the way of local control of the district.

 ""We sometimes lose sight of the fact that there are 32 local school districts in the city,"" Dr. Scribner said at the time, ""not just the handful that make the headlines because of their troubles, and a majority of the community school boards went through the year with hardly a major problem.""

 He remained committed to local control, a concept that has eroded in recent years as chancellors have lobbied for more authority, and finally came to an end with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's success in winning control of the system this year.

 By the end of his tenure, Dr. Scribner had few allies. In December 1972, Dr. Scribner announced that he would leave office in a few months because of ""a widening gap of confidence"" between him and the Board of Education. Board members said that Dr. Scribner was upset that they would not guarantee a contract extension.

 Harvey Bertram Scribner was born on July 7, 1914, in Albion, a small town in southeastern Maine. His father was a factory worker, and Dr. Scribner once described his own childhood as more bitter than bittersweet.

 After graduating from high school, Mr. Scribner went 20 miles off the Maine coast to work for a shop owner on Matinicus Island, where he recalled salting fish for Calvin Coolidge. To make ends meet, he worked nights and weekends at grocery stores and factories. He once described his time on the island as his education. He spent a year at a teacher-training academy and then dropped out to take a job as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Unity, Me.

 In 1946, he received a bachelor's degree from Farmington State Teachers College in Maine and became a school administrator. In 1951, he received a master's degree in education at the University of Maine. He received his doctorate in education from Boston University in 1960.

 In 1954, Mr. Scribner became the head of the school system in Dedham, Mass., where he raised eyebrows for promoting a federally financed program intended to determine how well students could teach one another. Mr. Scribner said that a local resident once described him as standing ""for all things that Communists stand for.""

 In 1961, he left to become the superintendent of schools in Teaneck, N.J., which became a crucible for dealing with racial issues in the suburbs. With the black population rising, whites were fleeing quickly to other suburban communities. He advocated adopting voluntary busing to keep the elementary schools integrated. Later, when that did not work, Dr. Scribner enforced mandatory busing. The plan provoked death threats and obscene telephone calls to Dr. Scribner. But the busing experiment worked.

 Dr. Scribner called his success there one of his most triumphant and emotional moments. ""I remember the walkie-talkie on the desk, I remember the first report, 'The buses just came in, everything was peaceful,' "" he was quoted as saying by The Record of Bergen County, N.J., in a speech in Teaneck in 1985. ""I was literally crying.""

 In 1968, he left for Vermont, where he challenged the state's entrenched educational bureaucracy.

 Dr. Scribner's first marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, Alta, died before him. He is survived by three daughters, Patricia Arno of Hartland, Me., from his first marriage, Jacqueline Cheney of Simsbury, Conn., and Donna Archambault of Leesburg, Fla.; six grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren; and three brothers, Morris Scribner of Benton, Me., Herbert Scribner of Fairfield, Me., and Norman Scribner of Naples, Fla.

 After leaving the New York school system, Dr. Scribner became a professor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, where he researched educational leadership and school administration.

 At the university, he wrote an acclaimed book based on his experiences: ""Make Your Schools Work: Practical, Imaginative and Cost-Free Plans to Turn Public Education Around"" (Simon & Schuster, 1975). Dr. Scribner also helped develop alternative schools in Boston for underprivileged children and a master's degree program for teachers in Washington.","Harvey B.

2002-01-24 00:00:00,56191,"John Arthur Love, a former Republican governor of Colorado and energy czar in the Nixon administration, died on Monday. He was 85 and lived in Denver.

 Mr. Love had only limited political experience when he was elected to the first of three terms as governor in 1963. He defeated an incumbent Democrat and stayed in office for 10 years, becoming the state's longest-serving governor at the time.

 In his third term he left to become the director of the new Office of Energy Policy under President Richard M. Nixon. He resigned six months later, complaining that he could not make a difference, and returned to Colorado. At the time, it was rumored that he had been ousted because he pressed for a stricter oil conservation program than Nixon wanted.

 In 1970 Mr. Love served on the President's Fact-Finding Commission on Vietnam.

 Known as a moderate Republican, Governor Love did not always agree with the majority of his party and signed legislation that legalized abortion and downgraded the possession of a small amount of marijuana to a misdemeanor from a felony. He encouraged big business to move to his state and signed the Colorado Air and Water Pollution Act to protect the environment.

 John Arthur Love was born in Gibson City, Ill., in 1916, and his family moved to Colorado in 1920 because of his father's tuberculosis. Mr. Love paid for his own education by washing dishes and working in a tuberculosis ward at Denver General Hospital. He graduated from the University of Denver in 1938 and earned his law degree there in 1941.

 He was a Navy pilot in the Pacific in World War II, twice winning the Distinguished Flying Cross. He left the Navy as a lieutenant commander in 1945 and opened a law firm in Colorado Springs.

 Before becoming governor, he served as leader of the El Paso County Young Republicans and president of the Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce.

 After returning to Colorado from Washington, in 1973, he taught history at the University of Northern Colorado, served as an adviser to a renowned regional law firm and in 1980 was named chief executive of Ideal Basics Industries, Inc., a maker of concrete and potash.

 Mr. Love's wife, Ann, died in 1999. He is survived by two sons, Maj. Gen. John Andrew Love of the Air National Guard and Dan Arthur Love; a daughter, Justice Rebecca Love Kourlis of the Colorado Supreme Court; and five grandchildren.","John Arthur Love, a former Republican governor of Colorado and energy czar in the Nixon administration, died on Monday.","The New York Times                             January 24, 2002 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  John Arthur Love, 85, Governor Of Colorado and an Energy Czar"
2003-07-22 00:00:00,44680,"Kenneth N. Dayton, a former chief executive of Dayton Hudson and grandson of the company's founder, died here on Saturday. He was 80.

 The cause was refractory anemia, a debilitating blood disease, his family said.

 Mr. Dayton was the last of the five Dayton brothers to be active in managing the retail empire founded by George Draper Dayton in 1902. He retired as chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, now the Target Corporation, in 1976, and stepped down from the board in 1983.

 He was the fourth of the Dayton brothers. Two of them -- Bruce and Douglas, both of Wayzata, Minn. -- survive. Donald, the eldest, died in 1989, and Wallace, a conservationist, died in October.

 After returning from Army service in Europe during World War II, Kenneth Dayton joined the family company in 1946, when it consisted of a single department store in downtown Minneapolis. Starting in the receiving room, he then worked in a number of merchandising roles, being president of the Dayton Hudson Corporation in 1969 and chief executive in 1970.

 The company went public in 1967, after expanding by building and buying more department stores and starting the Target discount chain to compete with other discounters.

 He and his wife, Judy, who were married for 50 years, contributed more than $100 million to the Minnesota Orchestra, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and other civic and social causes, according to Mr. Dayton's 2002 autobiography, ""What Fun!""

2003-02-08 00:00:00,25523,"Lord Aberconway, once a major British industrialist who built the Queen Elizabeth 2 ocean liner and who in 1939 took part in a secret meeting with Hitler's close aide Hermann Goring, died on Tuesday in London. He was 89.

 The meeting with seven British industrialists, aimed at averting a world war, was publicly discussed only in 1999. It was termed by some a second Munich, in reference to the famous efforts there to appease Hitler before the war, but Lord Aberconway said this was a misinterpretation.

 As heir to the wealthy family that also built the Lusitania and the Queen Mary, Lord Aberconway ruled an industrial empire that included John Brown & Company, which owned, among other things, the Clydeside shipyard in Scotland. His other financial interests included mining, banking and insurance.

 It was as a result of his involvement in the shipbuilding company that he took part in the secret meeting with Goring. Charles Frederick Spencer, a director of John Brown, was approached by a Swedish businessman who knew Goring and wanted to stop the accelerating skid toward war.

 The future Lord Aberconway, then Charles McLaren and already a director of John Brown at 26, was one of the seven British industrialists Mr. Spencer invited to meet with the German on an island in the Baltic Sea.

 The meeting was mentioned during the Nuremberg trials, but had not provoked much discussion. Three years ago, however, Lord Aberconway gave 38 pages of his personal documents to Andrew Roberts, a historian. Mr. Roberts interpreted the documents as saying that the unofficial British delegation raised the possibility of meeting German demands on Poland in return for Germany not invading that country.

 Lord Aberconway contended that the businessmen's only purpose was to relay the official British policy that an invasion of Poland would lead to war. Mr. Roberts disagreed, saying Lord Aberconway's documents showed that the British delegation had proposed what ""amounted to a second Munich conference"" to appease the Nazis.

 Debate over the matter was extensively covered in the British press in the summer of 1999, with Lord Aberconway insisting in The Times of London that Mr. Roberts's interpretation was ""nonsense.""

 Charles Melville McLaren was born on April 16, 1913. The title of Lord Aberconway had first been given to his grandfather, a prominent Liberal member of Parliament, who came by his fortune through marriage. Charles was educated at Eton and Oxford and qualified as a lawyer at the Middle Temple in London.

 He served in the Royal Artillery in World War II, and on his father's death in 1953 became Lord Aberconway, as well as chairman of John Brown and English China Clays, a mining concern.

 By the 1960's, British shipbuilding had greatly declined because of Asian competition, among other factors. Lord Aberconway bid to build the Queen Elizabeth 2, even though he said he would surely lose money. He explained in an interview with The New York Times in 1961 that he bid only to protect the jobs of his skilled workers. The industry continued to decline, and the final stages of building the ship had to be done in conjunction with other companies.

 By the mid-1960's, Lord Aberconway offered to sell his family's famed shipyard to the British government for one pound, but was turned down. After finishing the Queen Elizabeth 2, John Brown never built another ocean liner, but its many other interests kept it going. In 1986, the company was sold.

 In later years, Lord Aberconway's greatest fame came from a passion for gardening. He was president of the Royal Horticultural Society for 23 years. He was known in England for his yearly proclamation that the annual Chelsea Flower Show was the best ever.

 At least once a month, he visited the world famous Bodnant Gardens at Conway in north Wales, which his great-grandfather, Henry Pochin, had built. Surveying the prize-winning rhododendrons he personally nurtured, he would stride around its 60 acres in his knickerbockers, preceded by his immaculately dressed butler and with his wife and his gardener at his side.

 Flower enthusiasts never forgot his remarks in 1947, when the government permitted gardeners to return to flower gardening after having been required to grow vegetables during the war.

 ""I am very fond of vegetables,"" Lord Aberconway said in his presidential address to the horticultural society, ""but I do not wish to share my flower garden with vegetables in the same way that, while I am very fond of bacon, I do not wish to share my house with a pig.""

 In 1941, he married Deirdre Knewstub, with whom he had a son and two daughters. They divorced in 1949 and he married Ann Lindsay Bullard, with whom he had a son. His survivors include his wife, their son and a stepdaughter, and the son and two daughters from his first marriage.","Lord Aberconway, once a major British industrialist who built the Queen Elizabeth 2 ocean liner and who in 1939 took part in a secret meeting with Hitler's close aide Hermann Goring, died on Tuesday in London.","The New York Times                             February 8, 2003 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Lord Aberconway, 89, Met With Goring Secretly in '39"
2003-09-24 00:00:00,44927,"Hugo Young, a leading columnist, political author and chairman of the Scott Trust, which owns The Guardian and The Observer, died Monday in London. He was 64.

 The cause was cancer, his family said.

 In a 30-year career of publishing his opinions, he established himself as an authoritative and scholarly voice of liberal politics in Britain, writing with an elegance people attributed to his devotion to the narrative historian Macaulay and a judiciousness stemming from early training in the law.

 Courtly and modest in person with a gentle if biting wit, Mr. Young in his columns could adopt combative tones of moral indignation that led admirers to describe him as magisterial, and detractors to disparage him as Olympian. His obituary in The Guardian said, ""When some malpractice or moral lapse had offended him, his columns read like judgments from the bench.""

 Mr. Young was born Oct. 13, 1938, in Sheffield, the son of a manufacturing executive who, as the lord lieutenant of South Yorkshire, was the queen's representative to the region in central England. Though his Guardian columns generally tracked with the newspaper's left-of-center views, Mr. Young never signed on to a pet Guardian cause, the abolition of the monarchy.

 A law graduate from Oxford, he began his newspaper career on The Yorkshire Post in Leeds in 1961 and then spent two years in the United States as a graduate student at Princeton and Congressional fellow in Washington.

 On his return to England in 1965, he joined The Sunday Times, where two years later he became the chief editorial writer.

 From 1973 to 1984, he was the paper's political editor, establishing the Sunday column that first made him well known. In his last years there, Mr. Young clashed with the new owner, Rupert Murdoch, and the newly installed editor, Andrew Neil, and objected to their mission to popularize the paper as one he thought cheapened it.

 He left for The Guardian in 1984, but not before writing a farewell column which Mr. Neil in his memoirs later called ""a barely coded attack on Murdoch."" The column concluded, ""Today's Sunday Times may make profits, but it no longer makes waves.""

 He began a twice-weekly column at The Guardian and in 1989 published ""One of Us,"" an acclaimed political biography of Margaret Thatcher. That same year he took on the role of presiding over the Scott Trust, and in 1993, under his guidance, The Guardian, a Monday through Saturday paper, acquired The Observer, a Sunday paper.

 In recent years, he had become seized with the issue of Britain's role in Europe, and he faulted Prime Minister Tony Blair for not pressing ahead with a campaign to adopt the euro and end what he perceived as Britain's stubborn aloofness from the Continent. In 1998 he argued the case in another widely noted book, ""This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe From Churchill to Blair.""

 Mr. Young professed a lifelong affection for the United States, and he reiterated it in columns about Britain's special relationship with America even as his writing became stingingly oppositional with the arrival of George W. Bush in the White House. At first, he was also enthusiastic about Mr. Blair, but he increasingly attacked him, accusing him of making Britain subservient to the United States.

 His illness caused him to take four months off from writing, but in March he resumed, with a reduced schedule of one column a week. His last columns were pugnacious and urgent as he cataloged his disappointment with Mr. Blair and his disdain for Mr. Bush.

 In July, he called on the prime minister to step down because of what he viewed as Mr. Blair's having abandoned Britain's bond with Europe in his decision to ally himself with Mr. Bush in Iraq.

 Mr. Young's final column, published Sept. 16, was headlined, ""Under Blair, Britain has ceased to be a sovereign state,"" and Mr. Young concluded darkly, ""At last we see the consequences of our country's abject thrall to the U.S.""

 Mr. Young was married twice, first to Helen Mason, also a journalist, who died in 1989, and in 1990, to Lucy Waring, an American artist. In addition to his wife, Mr. Young is survived by a son, Dominic, a London news executive; and three daughters, all of London: Cecily, a nurse; Emily, a film director; and Victoria, a journalist.

 Though he spent his entire career close to politics, Mr. Young believed in maintaining distance from the people he wrote about .

 ""I can think of no more than three politicians I've regarded as friends,"" he wrote in a column in June addressing the subject of what columnists are for. ""Such fastidiousness is not an advantage for a columnist. It cuts off some of the inside dope. But I think it keeps the water purer.""","Hugo Young, a leading columnist, political author and chairman of the Scott Trust, which owns The Guardian and The Observer, died Monday in London.","The New York Times                            September 24, 2003 Wednesday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Hugo Young, Leading British Columnist, Is Dead at 64"

 He was 73.

 Mr. Dacko, who presided over the former French colony's independence only to be overthrown by Mr. Bokassa, his cousin, had long suffered from asthma and a heart condition. He died Thursday from respiratory problems, the radio said.

 He took over as president of the landlocked nation after the independence leader Barthelemy Boganda was killed in a plane crash in 1959.

 He went on to preside over the nation's declaration of independence but on New Year's Day in 1966, he was overthrown by the future self-proclaimed Emperor Bokassa.

 The flamboyant and capricious Mr. Bokassa, whose rule was shrouded by allegations of cannibalism and infanticide, was overthrown in 1979 with the help of French paratroopers. Mr. Dacko was reinstated as leader, and won elections in 1981 but was pushed aside soon afterward by the military ruler Andre Kolingba.

 The Central African Republic is rich in diamonds but impoverished by rampant corruption, smuggling and financial mismanagement.

He was 91.

 Mr. Newton was the president of the Commonwealth Fund from 1964 to 1975. In that time, the fund greatly expanded its work on medical education, encouraging medical schools to become more involved in community health issues and helping to establish medical schools to address shortages of doctors and medical centers, Mary Mahon, a spokeswoman for the fund, said yesterday.

 In 1970 the fund gave a total of $1.2 million to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in East Harlem, an affiliate of the City University of New York, to help them devise urban health care programs.

 Mr. Newton said at the time that the two grants were in response to a ""widely shared conviction that the dangerous deterioration and breakdown of medical and hospital services in cities across the country must somehow be reversed.""

 While he was president, the Commonwealth Fund provided seed money for the Harvard Community Health Plan. By late 1970, the plan had moved out of the experimental stage a year after it began and was becoming financially self-sustaining. The Harvard plan was the first prepaid health care delivery program by a university for people of varied income levels.

 Mr. Newton became the fund's president after being president of the University of Colorado from 1956 to 1963. Under his leadership, there were substantial increases in graduate enrollment, faculty salaries and library spending.

 But the university was also shaken by controversies. One arose in 1962 when an article in the campus newspaper described Senator Barry Goldwater, the Arizona Republican, as ""a fool, a mountebank, a murderer.""

 Mr. Newton removed the newspaper's student editor, citing ""the best interest of the university."" Several weeks later, he said he would step down as its president in 1963.

 He served two terms as the mayor of Denver, from 1947 to 1955. He was president of the American Municipal Association in 1949 and 1950, and in 1950 was chairman of the Attorney General's Conference on Organized Crime.

 The cause has not been determined, his son Michael said, but he had multiple health problems.

 Mr. Ilyinsky was a second cousin to Czar Nicholas II and a great-great-grandson of Alexander II. He served as mayor of Palm Beach for seven years and as a city councilman for 11 years. His first race for mayor, in 1987, gained national attention because he was running against Yvelyne de Marcellus Marix, who said he was a descendant of Charlemagne. Mr. Ilyinsky lost. He won election in 1993 and served until 2000.

 Paul Romanov Ilyinsky was born in London on Jan. 27, 1928, son of Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, a cousin of Nicholas II who was exiled after participating in the famously difficult killing of Rasputin, and Audrey Emery, an heiress from a Cincinnati industrialist family. Mr. Ilyinsky's parents divorced in 1937, and when World War II broke out, he left Europe to live with his mother in the United States and became an American citizen.

 He enlisted in the Marine Corps after high school and during a break in his service attended the University of Virginia. After returning to the military for the Korean War, he joined a business of his mother's family, selling real estate in Cincinnati.

 In 1979, Mr. Ilyinsky moved to Palm Beach where, in addition to his political career, he amassed enormous collections of toy soldiers and model trains.

 In addition to his son Michael, of Cincinnati, he is survived by his wife, Angelica, of Palm Beach; two daughters, Paula Comisar and Anne Glossenger, both of Cincinnati; a second son, Dmitri, of Litchfield, Conn.; a stepson, George Lock of Cincinnati; and nine grandchildren.

 Robert K. Massie, a historian of the Romanovs, said that Mr. Ilyinsky could have made a claim to the Russian throne, but that he was not interested. In an interview with Mr. Massie, he said: ''I am an American and I already have a public office to which I was elected.

 The cause was a complication of a blood clot, his daughter, Barbara, said.

 Mr. Feinberg's novel ''The King,'' which he wrote under the name Morton Cooper, followed the political aspirations and sexual misadventures of Harry Orlando, a character rumored to have been based on Frank Sinatra. The book earned praised for its realistic dialogue and rich detail but was criticized for its stock characters and steamy plot.

 ''None of us expected Morton Cooper to produce a work of genius,'' Bernard Geis, Mr. Feinberg's publisher, told The New York Times Book Review shortly after the release in 1967. ''But we knew from the beginning that the book was very commercial.''

 The success of ''The King'' owed much to an audience hungry for pulp and a relentless international marketing campaign, unusual for its day, that included a six-week European tour and a contest among London bookstores to create the most original promotional display..

 Mr. Feinberg was born in Greensburg, Pa., in 1925. He moved to New York after high school and began writing children's television programs, including a marionette series, ''Funny Bunnies.''

 In the 1950's Mr. Feinberg started writing paperbacks, many under pseudonyms that shared his initials. Later, he wrote freelance articles for The Chicago Defender.

 After ''The King,'' Mr. Feinberg wrote five more hardcover books, but none attained the same financial success.

 Family members said he died at home after a lengthy illness.

 Mr. Arosemena was elected vice president in 1960, and rose to the presidency after the ouster of President Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra a year later in a military coup.

 But Mr. Arosemena continued an unpopular economic austerity program begun by Dr. Ibarra, which resulted in a positive trade balance for Ecuador. After Mr. Arosemena survived two efforts to impeach him, the military overthrew him and sent him into exile in Panama.

2005-04-09 00:00:00,27427,"J. Carter Bacot, the former chairman and chief executive of the Bank of New York who transformed it from a traditional bank into a powerhouse in servicing other banks and the securities markets, died on Thursday at his home in Montclair, N. J. He was 72.

 The cause was cardiac arrest, a spokesman for the Bank of New York said.

 Mr. Bacot (pronounced BAY-co) oversaw the transformation of Bank of New York from a traditional retail bank engaged in commercial lending and the credit card business into a leader in the global securities servicing and processing arena, the backbone of the world's stock and bond markets.

 Mr. Bacot was known in the industry for his willingness to challenge accepted practices. His most notable deal at the bank was the landmark 1988 merger with the Irving Corporation. At the time it was the largest bank merger ever undertaken, and was a hostile takeover in an era and an industry in which hostile deals were not done.

 The 376-day battle for Irving faced innumerable regulatory and logistical hurdles, including the crash of the stock market, many lawsuits that were brought by Irving (including one against the Federal Reserve after it approved of the deal) and a last-minute offer from a white knight, which threatened to undo the deal.

 ''At a time when everyone said you can never do a hostile bank deal, and people said a deal of that size doesn't make sense, he was the one to have the foresight to see the extraordinary potential in the transaction and having seen that, he was determined to see it through,'' said Rodgin Cohen, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell, who worked closely with Mr. Bacot and the Bank of New York for more than 35 years.

 Mr. Bacot turned the Bank of New York from an old-line banking institution into a dominant force in an admittedly unglamorous but necessary part of the banking industry: global securities processing, the business of housing and moving securities around the world.

 While Mr. Bacot was chairman, the bank's assets increased to $60 billion from $11.5 billion and its net annual income rose to $1.1 billion from $58 million.

 Born in 1933 in Utica, N.Y., John Carter Bacot graduated from Hamilton College in 1955 and Cornell Law School in 1958.

 He joined the Bank of New York in 1960 and at various times was the head of the bank's investment research and personal trust departments.

 Mr. Bacot was named vice chairman of the holding company in 1975 and president in 1979. He was the chairman and chief executive from 1982 until 1998 and remained on the board until 2003.

 In addition to serving on many corporate boards, Mr. Bacot was on the board of the New York Philharmonic for 16 years and was a life trustee and chairman emeritus of Hamilton College.

 He is survived by his wife, Shirley Schou; two daughters, Susan Bacot and Betsy Bacot-Aigner; and two grandsons.","J.

2005-01-13 00:00:00,36008,"S. Paul Ehrlich, an epidemiologist and public health officer who served as acting surgeon general during a long organizational reshuffling under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, died on Jan. 6 in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 72.

 The cause was pneumonia, his family said.

 Dr. Ehrlich's public service began in 1959 at the National Heart Institute in Bethesda, Md., and took him to the upper echelons of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. An overhaul changing the department's structure, begun in 1968, even threatened to do away with the office of the surgeon general, which dated to the 1870's and was considered a primary advocate of public health in the country.

 A proposal to scrap the Public Health Service's Commissioned Corps would have gutted the position, which a report in 1971 called ''an organizational anomaly'' of no further use. The surgeon general at the time, Dr. Jesse L. Steinfeld, quit in 1973. Dr. Ehrlich, then director of the Office of International Health at H.E.W., was named acting surgeon general.

 He joined Dr. Steinfeld and others in the Public Health Service in defense of the corps and the surgeon general's office, and their strong support brought Congressional supporters to the rescue. Dr. Ehrlich kept the office alive until the arrival in 1977 of President Jimmy Carter's choice for surgeon general, Dr. Julius B. Richmond, who had organized Project Head Start in 1965.

 Saul Paul Ehrlich Jr. was born in Minneapolis and graduated in 1953 from the University of Minnesota, where he also earned his M.D. in 1957. He interned at the Public Health Service Hospital in Staten Island. His residency was in epidemiology at the University of California, where he received a master's degree in public health in 1961. He was board certified in preventive medicine.

 After the heart institute in Bethesda, Dr. Ehrlich worked on a national heart-disease control program in San Francisco and as its assistant and deputy chief in Arlington, Va. While at the headquarters of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, now the Department of Health and Human Services, he often represented the United States on the executive board of the World Health Organization.

 He was deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization, the W.H.O.'s regional office in Washington, from 1979 to 1983. He also contributed to professional journals and held teaching appointments at Georgetown University, the University of Texas and the University of California, Berkeley. He retired in 1984 after learning that he had multiple sclerosis.

 Dr. Ehrlich is survived by his wife of 45 years, Geraldine McKenna Ehrlich; three daughters, Dr. Susan P. Ehrlich of San Francisco, Dr. Paula Ehrlich of Hendricks, Pa., and Jill Ehrlich-Robinson of Ankara, Turkey; and one grandson.","S.

2005-06-13 00:00:00,27653,"J. James Exon, a Democrat who served two terms as governor of Nebraska and three terms in the Senate, died Friday. He was 83.

 His family said he died of natural causes. He was treated for cancer several years ago but had declined to discuss it extensively, saying in 2003, ''It's not a highly malignant type of cancer, and I'm not in dire straits.''

 A broad-shouldered man who was once called Big Jim, Mr. Exon started in the Democratic Party as a precinct worker and was chairman of the state party when he made his first bid for public office, winning the governor's race in 1970. He was elected to the Senate in 1978, serving through 1996.

 He was known for his direct approach in political and business matters. As governor, his perennial rallying cry was ''hold the line'' on taxes, and he regularly criticized the Legislature, sometimes referring to lawmakers as ''wild-eyed spenders.''

 He is the only Nebraskan besides George Norris, the architect of the state's one-house Legislature, to win five consecutive statewide elections.

 In his first try for public office, Mr. Exon defeated a Republican incumbent, Norbert Tiemann, to win the governor's race. He was re-elected in 1974 by a landslide, the first Nebraska governor to serve eight years. The term of office changed to four years from two years the year he was elected.

 While governor from 1971 to 1979, Mr. Exon's repeated vetoes of the Legislature's spending plans earned him a reputation as a fiscal conservative. He used his veto pen on 141 bills in his last seven years in office, an average of 20 vetoes a year.

 After two terms as governor, Mr. Exon rode his popularity to the Senate. He was elected in 1978 with 68 percent of the vote. In 1984, however, he came within 25,000 votes of defeat. He won a third term in 1990.

 Mr. Exon worked with both parties in Washington and often sided with Republicans on military and budget issues.

 Serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee, he helped shape military policy in the final years of the cold war. He was also a stalwart defender of the controversial B-2 stealth bomber.

 Mr. Exon said his proudest achievement was helping to write and secure passage of a spending reduction of $13 billion in 1994. Two years later, his Communication Decency Act was Congress's first effort at preventing children from seeing pornography on the Internet. The act was later overturned by the Supreme Court.

 After retiring, Mr. Exon served on a committee created by Congress and headed by John M. Deutch, a former director of central intelligence, to study the threat of biological and nuclear weapons. Mr. Exon warned of terrorism in the committee's 1999 report and recommended the creation of a federal agency like the new Department of Homeland Security.

 Norm Otto, who served as Mr. Exon's chief of staff during his eight years as governor, said Mr. Exon should be ''remembered as just a down-to-earth, common-sense governor that wasn't a bunch of fanfare.''

 Mr. Exon remained a familiar face on the campaign trail in his later years, endorsing his party's top candidates. ''Each election I'm busier than I am otherwise,'' Mr. Exon said in a campaign appearance in Omaha before the 2002 elections.

 John James Exon was born in Geddes, S.D., and attended Omaha University. After volunteering for the Army Signal Corps in World War II and serving in the Pacific, he returned to Nebraska and eventually founded Exon Office Supplies in Lincoln.

 When Nebraska's secretary of state declined to license the Exxon Corporation because its name was similar to that of Mr. Exon's company, Exxon paid Mr. Exon to grant his approval. The company was registered in 1972, while Mr. Exon was governor. He never revealed how much he received from the company.","J.

2005-06-28 00:00:00,27711,"Isidore Cohen, a violinist who, as a member of the Juilliard String Quartet and the Beaux Arts Trio, was an important chamber music performer and a teacher, died on Thursday in the Bronx. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.

 Mr. Cohen's death was announced by Frank Salomon, an administrator of the Marlboro Music School and Festival, the summer program in Marlboro, Vt., where Mr. Cohen taught for nearly 40 years.

 A genial, energetic musician whose interests ranged from Haydn to Elliott Carter, Mr. Cohen can be heard on dozens of classic recordings by the Beaux Arts Trio, including the complete Haydn and Beethoven Piano Trios and works by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Ives and Shostakovich.

 As the ensemble's violinist, he held a pivotal position, physically as well as musically. Early in Mr. Cohen's tenure with the group, the players decided that for acoustical reasons, the cellist -- then Bernard Greenhouse -- should face the audience directly. That meant that Mr. Greenhouse could not make eye contact with Menahem Pressler, the group's pianist. In what became a Beaux Arts visual quirk, Mr. Pressler regularly glanced over his shoulder at Mr. Cohen who, because he had eye contact with both of the other players, became a relay between them.

 Mr. Cohen was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 16, 1922. He began studying the violin at 6 and continued his studies at Music and Art High School in Manhattan, from which he graduated in 1940. At the time, however, he had not decided to seek a musical career, and enrolled at Brooklyn College as a pre-med student. His studies were interrupted in 1943, when he joined the United States Army and fought in Europe. During his three years in the service, Mr. Cohen performed in the Army's symphony orchestra and in jazz bands.

 When he returned to the United States, Mr. Cohen became a student of Ivan Galamian at the Juilliard School, and began a career as a freelance violinist. Starting in the early 1950's, he was concertmaster of the resident orchestras at the festivals directed by the cellist and conductor Pablo Casals, in Prades, France, and in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was later the concertmaster of several New York ensembles, including the Little Orchestra Society and, for several of its early seasons, the Mostly Mozart Orchestra.

 At the Casals festivals, Mr. Cohen met the violinist Alexander Schneider, who invited him to join the Schneider String Quartet as second violinist, in 1952. Among the Schneider Quartet's accomplishments was a traversal, both in concert and on recordings, of the complete Haydn quartets. In 1958, Mr. Cohen joined the Juilliard String Quartet, also as second violinist. He performed with the group for a decade.

 When the Beaux Arts Trio's original violinist, Daniel Guilet, retired in 1968, Mr. Pressler and Mr. Greenhouse invited Mr. Cohen to take his place. Mr. Cohen was reluctant at first.

 ''It seemed to me that the best thing to do would be to work together for a week or so and see how it went,'' he said in a 1979 interview. ''But they said, 'no, either you want to join or you don't.' I knew their playing, they knew mine, and it was two against one, so I joined.''

 By the mid-1970's, the Beaux Arts had become the world's most prominent piano trio and was touring and recording plentifully. Mr. Cohen remained a member until his retirement in 1992.

 During his years in the Juilliard and Beaux Arts groups, Mr. Cohen also taught, and was at various times a member of the faculties at the Aspen Festival, the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, the Juilliard School, Princeton University, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and the Manhattan School of Music. His most long-standing association, though, was with Marlboro, where he began teaching in 1966. He regularly toured as part of Musicians from Marlboro, a flexible ensemble that included both faculty and student performers.

 He is survived by a daughter, Erica Cohen of Tepoztlan, Mexico, and a son, Allen Cohen, of New York City, Marlboro and Madrid.","Isidore Cohen, a violinist who, as a member of the Juilliard String Quartet and the Beaux Arts Trio, was an important chamber music performer and a teacher, died on Thursday in the Bronx.","The New York Times                               June 28, 2005 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Isidore Cohen, 82, Violinist In Premier Chamber Groups"

 The cause was complications of a stroke, said his son, Dean Hammond, who later headed the company.

 Mr. Hammond helped the company, founded by his grandfather in 1900, as it evolved into the computer age from a time when dozens of cartographers sat at drafting tables and researchers called municipal officials around the country.

 ''He was the bridge,'' his son said, ''helping the longtime workers get comfortable with the new technology.''

 C. S. Hammond & Company was second only to Rand McNally in Chicago in producing road maps and atlases pinpointing cities and towns, large and tiny, across the country and around the world. The 1955 edition of ''Hammond's Ambassador World Atlas'' included 326 maps and a 242-page index with more than 100,000 location names.

 Mr. Hammond made his mark on the family-owned company by selling its maps to book publishers, including Random House and Simon & Schuster. In 1955 he produced a novel item, a foldable plastic globe that inflated to 18 inches in diameter.

 In 1999, the company was sold to Langenscheidt Publishers, a German company that produces travel books and maps. Now known as the Hammond World Atlas Company, it is based in Springfield, N.J.

 Caleb Dean Hammond Jr. was born on June 24, 1915, in Orange, N.J. He graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Mass., with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1937. In World War II, he served in the Coast Guard.

 In April 1948, Mr. Hammond was elected president of the company, succeeding his late uncle, Robert S. Hammond. He had been vice president and secretary of the company. Mr. Hammond's grandfather, Caleb Stillson Hammond, started the company in Brooklyn. It later moved to Manhattan, then to a warehouse on a slope near the family home in Maplewood.

 At any one time, more than 100 cartographers, artists and researchers might be working for the company. About 25 percent of their efforts were devoted to gathering material, the rest to updating old data. Mr. Hammond participated in the research.

 In a 1950 interview with The New York Herald Tribune, he told how he had written to a government official in India, seeking information on villages.

 ''Six months later,'' he said, ''I got an answer apologizing for the delay, but saying he had been on an elephant hunt and was just now getting back to his correspondence.''

 Although he retired in 1974, Mr. Hammond remained active, working with the staff as it adjusted to using computers. The company produced the first digitally generated world atlas in 1992.

 Besides his son, whose full name is Caleb Dean Hammond III, Mr. Hammond is survived by his wife of 66 years, Patricia Treacy Ehrgott Hammond; a brother, Stuart Lindsley Hammond; two daughters, Beth Lynn Steele and Wendie H.

 His death was confirmed by his wife of 64 years, Audrey. Mr. Enarson was Ohio State's president from 1972 to 1981. During his tenure, the university's Web site said, enrollment of women and blacks and the number of women on the faculty increased drastically.

 He presided over two universities during tumultuous times and wrestled with antiwar demonstrations as well as labor and fund-raising problems. Still, as he told The Columbus Dispatch in 2001, ''I will forever be associated with the firing of Woody,'' Ohio State's volatile and successful coach for 28 seasons.

 With less than two minutes remaining in the Buckeyes' 17-15 loss to Clemson in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 29, 1978, middle guard Charlie Bauman intercepted a pass thrown by Ohio State quarterback Art Schlichter. Bauman ran out of bounds near the Ohio State bench and when he got up, Hayes hit him and had to be pulled away by Buckeyes players.

 Mr. Enarson and Hugh Hindman, the athletic director at the time, met late into the night and decided that Hayes would be relieved of his duties the next morning.

 Speaking of his tenure in an interview in 2002 as part of the university's oral history project, Mr. Enarson said that Hayes had refused to apologize, so he was given no opportunity to resign in lieu of being fired.

 Mr. Enarson served more than 20 years as director and adviser for the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, before and after his years in Ohio.

 Mr. Enarson, who grew up during the Depression in New Mexico, enlisted in the Army right after Pearl Harbor. He graduated from and worked for the University of New Mexico, then became the first president of Cleveland State University, a position he held for seven years.

 His son, Andrew McColough, said the cause was cardiac arrest after a long illness.

 During a lengthy career, Mr. McColough was a fixture in American commerce. In addition to Xerox executive posts, he served on the boards of the New York Stock Exchange, Citibank, Union Carbide and Knight Ridder. He was also chairman of the United Way of America, and the treasurer of the Democratic National Committee from 1974 to 1976.

 He was a graduate of the Harvard Business School class of 1949, and like most of the men who attended the school in the aftermath of World War II, he had seen military duty, serving briefly in the British Navy in the final year of the war.

 Of that class of 700, nearly a third rose to the rank of president or chief executive of a company, according to David Callaghan, the author of a book on the class of '49. Fortune magazine called it ''the class the dollars fell on.''

 Mr. McColough was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the oldest son of the director of public works for the Parliament of Canada. He graduated from Dalhousie University in Halifax and then earned a law degree at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto before attending Harvard.

 He began his business career at the Lehigh Navigation Coal Sales Company and in 1954 joined the Haloid Company, as Xerox was then known, as general manager of its first reproduction service center in Chicago. At that time, the company was a little-known maker of industrial photocopying equipment.

 Five years later, the company introduced its first copier for offices, and its business took off. In 1959, Mr. McColough was promoted to general sales manager; a year later he was made vice president for sales. In 1961 he was elected to the board and in 1966, he became president.

 Mr. McColough was named chief executive in 1968 after the death of the company's longtime chief, Joseph C. Wilson. He became chairman in 1971, and held those positions until his retirement.

 During Mr. McColough's tenure at Xerox, he and Mr. Wilson adopted one of the first affirmative-action programs at a major corporation. In 1970, Mr. McColough also created Xerox's PARC research center, where many features of early personal computers were pioneered, though not produced by the company, which remained best known for its copying business.

 The company's revenue grew almost 10-fold to $8.5 billion in 1981, his last full year as chief executive, from $896 million in 1968, the year he attained the post. ''He led our company through a period of explosive growth and global expansion,'' Anne M. Mulcahy, the current chief executive, said in an e-mail memo to employees last week.

 Mr. McColough is survived by his wife of 53 years, Mary Virginia White McColough of Greenwich, Conn. They had five children, three of whom survive; they are Andrew McColough, of Fairfield, Conn.; Ian McColough, of New York City; and Virginia McColough Keeshan, also of Greenwich. Mr. McColough is also survived by his sister, Patricia McColough Wallace, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and seven grandchildren.","C.

2006-07-25 00:00:00,13902,"James E. West, who was recalled from office as mayor of Spokane over an Internet gay sex scandal, died on Saturday. He was 55.

 The cause was complications of recent cancer surgery, according to a family statement issued by the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle.

 Mr. West, a Republican who had frequently opposed gay rights bills in his 20 years as a state legislator, was voted out of the mayor's office last December, seven months after The Spokesman-Review, the Spokane daily, began publishing results of a computer sting it had conducted to track his online activities in a gay chat room. The newspaper reported that in Internet chats involving discussions about sex, he had offered to help someone he thought was an 18-year-old high school student get a City Hall internship.

 The mayor acknowledged having relations with adult men but denied doing anything illegal. The F.B.I. conducted a public corruption investigation into whether he had used his office for personal benefit, but the inquiry ended with no criminal charges.

 Mr. West had risen to majority leader of the State Senate before stepping down in 2003 to run for his ''dream job,'' that of Spokane mayor.

 But less than 18 months into his four-year term, The Spokesman-Review began publishing its series on his online activities.

 The City Council, business leaders, and the state and local Republican parties were soon urging that he resign, but he refused and fought the recall.

 With the recall vote pending, he said in an interview last October: ''I wish I had never gone online at all. I scratch my head today. I can't tell you why.''

 ''It's an unusual episode in my life,'' he said. ''I wish there was a rewind button; rewind and erase and start over. Basically, that's what I'm asking the public, for a second chance.''

 Instead, the voters turned him out, 65 percent to 35 percent.

 The outcome made him the first Spokane city official to be recalled from office, and ended a 27-year career in state and city politics.

 Mr. West was divorced and had no children. He is survived by his father, a brother and a sister.","James E.

2007-12-28 00:00:00,38895,"Steven T. Florio, a former chief executive of Conde Nast Publications who thrived by selling expensive advertising for expensive products in magazines like Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, died Thursday in Manhattan. He was 58 and had homes in Manhattan, Sag Harbor, N.Y., and Key Largo, Fla.

 The cause was complications of a heart attack, said Maurie Perl, a spokeswoman for Conde Nast.

 For 10 years, until 2004, Mr. Florio led Conde Nast, the magazine division of Advance Publications, the parent company owned by the Newhouse family.

 It was a period of great change in the magazine industry, with many companies downsizing because of the growth of the Internet. Still, under Mr. Florio's leadership, Conde Nast expanded from a relatively small company to the second-largest magazine publisher in the country, mostly by concentrating on magazines aimed at wealthy consumers of luxury goods and by aggressively focusing on selling advertising in them.

 As president and chief executive, Mr. Florio oversaw all 16 of the company's magazines, which then included Glamour, Architectural Digest, Self, GQ, Gourmet, Bon Appetit, Conde Nast Traveler, Allure, Wired, Lucky and Teen Vogue, as well as Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. The magazines reach more than 70 million readers each month.

 Attuned more to the business end of publishing than to content, Mr. Florio helped form a large group sales force directed at selling advertisements that were meant to run in all or most of the company's publications. While he was chief executive, the company began Lucky, a magazine about shopping, which became a success at a time when few magazines were being started.

 In the publishing industry, Mr. Florio was known for outsized rhetoric and a personality to match.

 ''We blew past Hachette, then we blew past Hearst, and for a while we were right on the heels of Time Inc.,'' Mr. Florio wrote of his company's expansion, in a 2005 proposal for an autobiography that he later decided not to complete.

 ''I was, after all, Steve Florio,'' he added, ''the Godfather, the Samurai, the leader, the warrior.''

 David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, said Thursday that Mr. Florio could be ''remarkably effective'' in using a warm, funny and expansive personality to do business.

 ''Steve was the antithesis of a business-school-minted android,'' Mr. Remnick said. ''He had Groucho's big cigar and sly mustache, and he was pinstriped and dapper like one of Peter Arno's cartoon executives.''

 Steven Thomas Florio was born in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, on April 19, 1949, one of three children of F. Steve and Sophie Masciale Florio. He graduated from New York University with a business degree in 1971.

 Besides his mother, of Middle Island, N.Y., Mr. Florio is survived by his wife of 33 years, the former Mariann McNeill; two brothers, Michael, of Middle Island, and Thomas, of Manhattan, who is the publisher of Vogue; a daughter, Kelly Florio of Manhattan; and a son, Steven John, also of Manhattan.

 Mr. Florio began his publishing career at Esquire, rising from research associate to vice president and advertising director in nine years. In May 1985, he was named president of The New Yorker, when the company was purchased by Advance Publications; in January 1988, he was given the additional title of chief executive. Before joining The New Yorker, he was publisher of GQ.

 As chief executive of Conde Nast, Mr. Florio had an occasionally tense relationship with his boss, S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman.

 On Thursday, in a short written statement, Mr. Newhouse said: ''Steve was a great executive and a great leader. I'm very glad we had many years together.''

 Mr. Florio said he had stepped down from the top job not because of any conflicts but simply because he was tired of the 18-hour days. In his 40-page book proposal, he wrote: ''I was not short on nerve or ego, and I carried a heavy chip on my shoulder. They'll bury me with it, too. I was there to get the job done.''","Steven T.

2007-02-17 00:00:00,15138,"Ray Evans, a pop lyricist who teamed up with the composer and lyricist Jay Livingston to write three Academy Award-winning songs and one of Nat King Cole's best-known classics, as well as the Christmas standard ''Silver Bells,'' died on Thursday in Los Angeles. He was 92.

 Jim Steinblatt, a spokesman for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, announced the death.

 In their heyday, in the 1940s and '50s, the team of Evans and Livingston was much in demand in Hollywood, turning out songs for film after film that often became big jukebox hits. The team was formed after Mr. Evans met Mr. Livingston at the University of Pennsylvania, survived separation during the war years and enjoyed decades of success until the emergence of rock 'n' roll.

 Evans and Livingston received their first best- song Oscar for ''Buttons and Bows,'' a bouncy tune from the 1948 comedy-western ''The Paleface.'' It was introduced by Bob Hope, playing the timid dentist ''Painless'' Peter Potter, who sang it to Jane Russell. Dinah Shore had a hit record with it, and the song spent 19 weeks on the ''Hit Parade'' radio program.

 ''Mona Lisa'' was written in 1950 for a forgettable Alan Ladd film called ''Captain Carey, U.S.A.'' In the movie, the song is used to send a signal to Italian partisans during World War II. Originally, it was called ''Prima Donna,'' but Mr. Evans's wife, Wyn, preferred ''Mona Lisa.'' The songwriting team agreed.

 Before the release of the film, Mr. Livingston and Mr. Evans went to see Nat King Cole to interest him in recording it. That day, Mr. Cole's baby daughter Natalie was making such a fuss that Mr. Cole had trouble hearing it, but agreed to record it, even though he was not sure a song about a da Vinci painting was commercially promising. Capitol Records had so little faith in the song that it was put on the B side of a single, paired with something called ''The Greatest Inventor of Them All.''

 It became one of Cole's greatest and most enduring hits, and Mr. Evans was especially pleased when Natalie Cole revived it on a hit record of her own.

 ''Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be''),'' which won a third Oscar for the team, was sung by Doris Day in ''The Man Who Knew Too Much''(1956), Alfred Hitchcock's remake of his own1934 film. A little improbably, Ms. Day belts it out to signal to her kidnapped child that she and her husband (James Stewart) have come to the rescue.

 Ms. Day's recording was a hit, and it, too, survived in other recordings and even a television commercial.

 Other Livingston-Evans movie songs were nominated for Oscars, among them ''The Cat and the Canary,'' from ''Why Girls Leave Home'' (1945); ''Tammy,'' from ''Tammy and the Bachelor'' (1957), which became a best-selling record for Debbie Reynolds; ''Almost in Your Arms,'' from ''Houseboat'' (1958); and ''Dear Heart,'' from the 1964 movie of the same name, starring Glenn Ford and Geraldine Page. Andy Williams had a hit with ''Dear Heart,'' singing the Livingston-Evans lyrics to music by Henry Mancini.

 Mr. Livingston and Mr. Evans also wrote the lyrics for a 1947 tune that Victor Young adapted from a Hungarian folk song to serve as the theme for the movie ''Golden Earrings.'' Sung in the movie by the basso Murvyn Vye, it became a hit record by Peggy Lee.

 ''To Each His Own'' was a big hit in 1946 for several performers: Eddy Howard, the Ink Spots, Tony Martin, Freddie Martin and the Modernaires.Perhaps the team's biggest commercial success was a Christmas song they first called ''Tinkle Bell'' until Lynne Livingston, Jay's wife, objected to the title. The song became ''Silver Bells,'' and it was first sung by Bob Hope in ''The Lemon Drop Kid'' (1951). ''Silver Bells'' is one of the most popular Christmas songs ever written, selling millions of records.

 Mr. Evans and Mr. Livingston were both small-town guys, Mr. Livingston from McDonald, Pa., and Mr. Evans from Salamanca, in the middle of a Seneca Indian reservation in western New York.

 Mr. Evans was born there on Feb. 4, 1915, the son of Philip Evans and Frances Lipsitz Evans. The elder Evans was a scrap dealer from Latvia. Neither parent was musical.

 Ray Evans learned to play clarinet and saxophone in high school and organized a dance band there, which he said ''wasn't very good.''

 While he was at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, he met Mr. Livingston, who was studying journalism at the university and was the organizer of a dance band. Mr. Evans tried out for the band and made it, and the two became partners for more than 60 years.

 After graduation, they moved to New York to try their hand at Tin Pan Alley songwriting. They had a hit with ''G'Bye Now'' in 1941, but World War II intervened, and Mr. Livingston was inducted into the Army. Mr. Evans took a bookkeeping job at an aircraft plant on Long Island.

 In 1944, they reunited and, after some work in New York, including writing special material for the comedy team of Olsen and Johnson, they attracted the attention of Johnny Mercer, who liked their work and opened doors for them in Hollywood.

 In the years that followed, they wrote 600 to 700 songs, of which 300 were published. They also contributed songs to more than 80 movies, including ''My Favorite Brunette'' (1947); ''Whispering Smith'' (1948); ''Sorrowful Jones'' (1949); ; ''Fancy Pants'' (1950); ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951); ''Aaron Slick From Punkin Crick'' (1952); ''That's My Boy'' (1951); ; ''Lucy Gallant'' (1955); ''Istanbul'' (1957); ; ''The James Dean Story'' (1957); ''This Happy Feeling'' (1958); ; and ''Wait Until Dark'' (1967).

 For some of these films they worked with the great names in movie music, like Percy Faith, Max Steiner, Neal Hefti, David Rose, Jimmy McHugh, Franz Waxman and Sammy Cahn.

 The team tried the theater without much success and found little demand in Hollywood for their kind of music once rock arrived. In later years the pair turned their attention to television and wrote the theme music for long-running series like ''Bonanza'' and ''Mr. Ed.'' Mr. Livingston died in 2001.

 Mr. Evans, who had no children and is survived by his sister, Doris Feinberg of Salamanca, was a self-deprecating fellow who liked to call himself a ''sounding board'' for his partner. But he was much honored in Salamanca, which renamed its movie house the Ray Evans Seneca Theater.","Ray Evans, a pop lyricist who teamed up with the composer and lyricist Jay Livingston to write three Academy Award-winning songs and one of Nat King Cole's best-known classics, as well as the Christmas standard ''Silver Bells,'' died on Thursday in Los Angeles.","The New York Times                             February 17, 2007 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Ray Evans, Lyricist of Hit Songs From Movies, Dies at 92"
2007-05-17 00:00:00,29098,"Yolanda King, the eldest child of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who melded her father's message of racial equality and nonviolence with her own calling as an actor and a motivational speaker, died on Tuesday in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 51.

 Steve Klein, a spokesman for the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, said the cause of death had not been determined but seemed related to cardiopulmonary problems.

 Ms. King was meeting her brother Dexter King at a friend's home when she collapsed and died.

 Yolanda Denise King, who was born on Nov. 17, 1955, in Montgomery, Ala., lived virtually her entire life in the maelstrom of the civil rights revolution that her father and mother, Coretta Scott King, helped lead. Dr. King was assassinated in 1968, and Mrs. King died last year.

 Besides her brother Dexter Scott King, Yolanda King is survived by another brother, Martin Luther King II, and her sister, the Rev. Bernice King.

 Yolanda King wrote and produced plays; gave speeches to groups that included elementary schoolchildren and Fortune 500 corporations; and acted in commercial movies. With Elodia Tate, she edited a motivational book emphasizing the importance of diversity. Ms. King's consistent goal was to infect her work, including her films, with her family's deeper purposes.

 She portrayed Rosa Parks, who sparked the civil rights movement by refusing to give up her bus seat in a miniseries, ''King'' (1978), and Betty Shabazz, the wife of Malcolm X, in ''Death of a Prophet'' (1981).

 In 1999, she acted in ''Selma, Lord, Selma,'' about the civil rights march, and in 1996 appeared in ''Ghosts of Mississippi,'' about efforts to track down the killer of Medgar Evers, the civil rights leader.

 She founded a dramatic group with Atallah Shabazz, daughter of Malcolm X, the slain civil rights leader, and started a theatrical production company, Higher Ground Productions, dedicated to what she called personal empowerment. She was also on the board of the King Center.

 In a statement, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a veteran of the civil rights movement, said that being Dr. King's daughter was to carry an extra burden.

 It began on Jan. 30, 1956, when Yolanda, nicknamed Yoki, was 2 months old and the family's house was bombed in the Montgomery bus boycott.

 In 1958, Dr. King narrowly escaped death when he was stabbed in a bookstore in Harlem. To Yolanda, it seemed as if adults naturally went to jail occasionally, because all those she knew seemed to do that.

 Her deepest memories were the love of her father, who taught her to swim and playfully pummeled her but never spanked her. She called him ''my first buddy,'' saying, ''I was tremendously loved.''

 Ms. King was 12 on April 4, 1968, when she heard a news bulletin on television saying her father had been assassinated in Memphis. Four days later, she and her brothers accompanied their mother to appear at Memphis City Hall. Mrs. King said the children attended because they wanted to.

 The next year, Ms. King's uncle A. D. King, her father's sole brother, accidentally drowned. In 1974, an apparent madman fired a gun in the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and killed her grandmother Alberta Williams King.

 Yolanda King learned about racial discrimination at 3 or 4 when she was barred from an amusement park. She was one of the first black children at a previously segregated elementary school in Atlanta, where she endured racial epithets. In high school, she was president of her sophomore and junior classes and vice president of her senior class.

 She wrote her first play at 8, and her mother sent her to acting school the next year. Her decision in 1971 to play a prostitute in a school production of Bill Manhoff's ''Owl and the Pussycat,'' which involved kissing a white man, scandalized the white and black communities. Her paternal grandfather, the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., refused to attend, but her mother supported her.

 Ms. King graduated from Smith College and earned a master of fine arts degree from New York University. She then toured the country with the Christian Theater Artist Company, which she helped found.

 In an interview with The Baltimore Sun in 1998, Ms. King said acting had liberated her, not least the parts unrelated to her family history.

 ''In life,'' she said, ''I had to be prim and proper and poised -- the King daughter. But acting, I could be zany, silly, sometimes the foolish person that I am. I could let the rough edges show.''","Yolanda King, the eldest child of the Rev.","The New York Times                               May 17, 2007 Thursday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Yolanda King, 51, Actor and Dr. King's Daughter, Dies"
2007-06-29 00:00:00,29234,"Kiichi Miyazawa, who, as prime minister and holder of many other top government posts, helped guide Japan from postwar ruin to economic superpower, died yesterday at his home in Tokyo. He was 87.

 Shigeru Muta, an aide to Mr. Miyazawa's nephew, Yoichi Miyazawa, a Japanese lawmaker, announced the death, The Associated Press reported.

 Mr. Miyazawa emerged from a wealthy and politically powerful family to attain influence as an aide to policy makers who fashioned Japan's immediate postwar recovery and went on to hold important cabinet posts, including that of foreign minister, before becoming prime minister in November 1991.

 In his two years at the head of the government, he pushed for better ties with Japan's Asian neighbors and was the first Japanese prime minister to acknowledge the involvement of the nation's military in forcing Asian women to serve as sex slaves for soldiers.

 His government passed a watershed law paving the way for Japan to send peacekeeping troops overseas, but resisted more profound changes in the pacifist Constitution. He negotiated a major trade accord with the United States and instituted banking reforms as he battled a gathering economic malaise that would endure for a decade.

 As finance minister in 1986 and 1987, he won popularity with high levels of public works spending, financing some of it through privatization of government companies.

 To Americans he was vividly etched in the public consciousness when in 1992, President Bush fell ill at a banquet during a trip to Japan and vomited on him. The prime minister cradled the head of the flu-stricken president in his lap afterward.

 Mr. Miyazawa was long known as a shrewd backroom operator who seriously contended for the office of prime minister beginning in the late 1970s.

 He occupied the fuzzy borderline where his Liberal Democratic Party intersected with business interests. His rise was perceived as a return to old-style politics, signifying indifference to reforms being proposed at the time he became prime minister, The New York Times suggested at the time in an analytical article.

 His career was thought to have ended in December 1988, when he was forced to resign as finance minister because of his involvement in a corporate influence-peddling scandal. In 1993 he was ousted as prime minister after he could not pass political reform bills he had promised. That ended the Liberal Democratic Party's 38 consecutive years of rule.

 In a rare case of a former prime minister's taking a lesser cabinet post, he returned to serve as finance minister at the age of 78 in 1998. He proposed a system of bilateral currency swaps between Asian countries that is still in place today.

 Kiichi Miyazawa was born on Oct. 8, 1919, in Tokyo. His father represented the Hiroshima area in Parliament, and his mother came from a prominent political family. A teacher wrote on his report card, ''He speaks his own mind, and some of his classmates don't like his straightforwardness.''

 He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University, and he attended a conference of American and Japanese students in the United States in 1939. His intellectual prowess allowed him to avoid military service in World War II.

 In 1942 he joined the Finance Ministry and within seven years had become the minister's private secretary. Like many Japanese, he recalled the American postwar occupation with distaste, particularly having to listen to lectures by Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur.

 ''It may be hard for young people today to understand how unpleasant it was to live under the occupation,'' he wrote in his memoirs.

 Mr. Miyazawa was an aide to his country's delegation at the peace conference in San Francisco in 1951. There, 49 nations restored ''full sovereignty'' to Japan while permitting the continuing presence of American troops on Japanese soil.

 From 1953 to 1965, Mr. Miyazawa served in the largely ceremonial upper house of Parliament. In 1967 he was elected to his father's seat in the lower house.

 His government posts while a member of the house included general director of the Economic Planning Agency and minister of international trade and industry. He was also chairman of his party's executive council.

 The Japanese government released no information on survivors, but this year's edition of Who's Who said he had a wife and two children.

 Mr. Miyazawa admired the United States as a student, and his excellent English allowed him to forge warm relationships with Americans. When he concluded a major trade pact with the United States in 1993, he attributed his success to charming President Clinton over a sushi dinner.

 He could also be provocative. As prime minister, he said Japan must show ''compassion'' for social problems like homelessness in the United States, and criticized Americans' work ethic.","Kiichi Miyazawa, who, as prime minister and holder of many other top government posts, helped guide Japan from postwar ruin to economic superpower, died yesterday at his home in Tokyo.","The New York Times                                June 29, 2007 Friday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan Premier in the 90s, Dies at 87"
2007-10-13 00:00:00,38663,"Prime Minister Soe Win, blamed for overseeing a bloody attack on the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers in 2003, died Friday. He was 59.

 His death was announced by relatives and the state news media. He was said to have been ill with leukemia.

 The fourth-ranking member of the military junta, General Soe Win was largely considered a figurehead, and his death is unlikely to cause a change in the regime's grip on power.

 He died as the junta continued its crackdown on democracy advocates that followed weeks of protests in this tightly controlled country.

 General Soe Win was nicknamed ''the butcher of Dipeyin'' for his role in the 2003 attack on Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers near the northern town of Dipeyin. Details remain murky, but several dozen of her supporters were believed killed when a mob of government partisans ambushed her motorcade. General Soe Win was seen as masterminding the attack, according to diplomats, rights groups and government critics.

 The general first achieved notoriety as one of the officers who brutally suppressed a 1988 pro-democracy uprising, commanding troops around Rangoon University -- a center for demonstrations -- and giving orders to fire on a crowd of protesters in front of Rangoon General Hospital. Rangoon, now Yangon, is Myanmar's largest city.

 The current junta seized power that year. It held a general election in 1990, but refused to recognize a landslide victory by the opposition party of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize the following year.

 General Soe Win became prime minister in 2004. He replaced Gen. Khin Nyunt, who was ousted by army hard-liners and charged with corruption in what was seen as a victory over moderates in the regime.

 Lt. Gen. Thein Sein, who has been serving as acting prime minister, is expected to replace General Soe Win. General Thein Sein is known as a fierce loyalist of Senior Gen. Than Shwe, the junta leader.

 General Soe Win was a former air force chief and a commander of the northwestern military region. He joined the junta's inner circle in 2003 and was promoted in a 2003 shake-up.

 General Soe Win, who had been treated in Singapore for his illness, returned to Myanmar on Sept. 30. He is survived by his wife and their son and daughter. His twin brother died Sept. 19.","Prime Minister Soe Win, blamed for overseeing a bloody attack on the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and her followers in 2003, died Friday.","The New York Times                             October 13, 2007 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Soe Win, 59, Junta Member Blamed in '03 Burmese Raid"
2008-03-08 00:00:00,35672,"Francis Pym, Britain's foreign secretary under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during the 1982 Falklands War only to be fired a year later, died on Friday after a long illness. He was 86.

 Lord Pym of Sandy, as he became after he was named to the House of Lords in 1987, was a decorated veteran of World War II who earned respect for resisting the radical shake-up of British politics that became known as ''Thatcherism.''

 The author of one of the best-known biographies of Mrs. Thatcher, Hugo Young, described him as ''perhaps the most perfect epitome of the kind of Conservative politics Mrs. Thatcher detested.''

 Parliamentary resistance to overbearing authority was in his bloodline. He was a descendant of John Pym, a leader of the 17th-century ''Roundheads'' who led parliamentary opposition to King Charles I in England's civil war. He served more than 25 years in the House of Commons from the county of Cambridgeshire, the fifth member of his family to serve in Parliament over a 300-year period.

 His readiness to stand up to Mrs. Thatcher was an underlying theme in many of the tributes paid to him on Friday by British politicians. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, once a vigorous opponent of the Thatcher economic reforms, called him ''a distinguished parliamentarian'' who would be remembered as ''a good man who always did what he thought was right for his country.''

 Mrs. Thatcher's office issued no immediate comment.

 Mr. Pym served as secretary of state for Northern Ireland under Prime Minister Edward Heath in the early 1970s. When Mrs. Thatcher took office in 1979, he became defense minister, but lasted only two years when he resisted the cuts she ordered. In 1982, he reached the pinnacle of his political career when he was appointed foreign secretary. He was widely admired for his role in the Falklands War, first launching into intensive shuttle diplomacy in an attempt to prevent the conflict, then resolutely defending the British military action to recover the islands.

 The immediate cause of his political downfall was a BBC interview he gave during the 1983 election campaign, called when Mrs. Thatcher's popularity was at its height. He said he hoped there would not be a landslide victory for the Conservatives, since landslides rarely resulted in good government.

 When Mrs. Thatcher duly won a landslide victory, he was fired, but the underlying reason was his role as a leading ''wet.'' That was the term used by Thatcher loyalists to describe Conservative traditionalists who adhered to so-called one nation Toryism, which opposed economic policies that, by aiming at trade unions, threatened to deepen class divisions in Britain.

 Francis Leslie Pym was born on Feb. 13, 1922, and was educated at Eton and Oxford.

2008-07-01 00:00:00,11814,"Kenneth A. Macke, a former chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the forerunner of the retail giant Target Corporation, died Saturday near his home in Napa, Calif. He was 69.

 The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said Ann Barkelew, a former spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson.

 In a 33-year career with Dayton Hudson, Mr. Macke rose from a sales trainee hired right out of college to chairman and chief executive of Target, which was then a division of Dayton Hudson, and on to chairman and chief executive of the entire company.

 When Mr. Macke retired in 1994, at the age of 55, Dayton Hudson was one of the five largest general merchandise retailers in the country, with annual revenue of $19.23 billion. In 1983, when he was elected chairman and chief executive, it had revenue of $6.5 billion.

 Dayton Hudson, a Minneapolis-based department store chain started in 1902 by George Draper Dayton as a dry goods store, was renamed the Target Corporation in 1999. There were 49 Target stores in nine states when Mr. Macke was chosen to lead the division in 1976, and 137 stores in 16 states by the time he was promoted to chief executive of Dayton Hudson in 1983. Target now has 1,613 United States outlets.

 Although there was considerable growth at Dayton Hudson in the decade that Mr. Macke led the company, there were also significant challenges.

 In 1987, he repelled a $6.6 billion hostile takeover by a holding company based in Washington, the Dart Group, largely with the help of Minnesota politicians who were well aware of Dayton Hudson's standing with the state's voters. At the time, the company employed 34,000 Minnesotans. Every Christmas, thousands of children would go to the auditorium at the company's downtown Minneapolis store for its annual holiday show.

 The Dart Group tried to acquire Dayton Hudson at a somewhat vulnerable moment in 1987. Though annual revenue had grown during Mr. Macke's tenure, earnings had been virtually flat for two years. Mr. Macke had begun reorganizing the company with the 1986 sale of the B. Dalton bookstore chain, but some divisions were struggling.

 The company was incorporated in Minnesota, and Mr. Macke appealed to Gov. Rudolph G. Perpich, who convened a special legislative session. In one day, an antitakeover law was written and passed. It stipulated that an investor who acquired a Minnesota company in a hostile takeover was barred from liquidating any of its assets for at least five years. The takeover effort eventually faded with the October 1987 stock market crash. The next year, Dayton Hudson's net earnings rose 26 percent, to $287 million.

 In 1990, Dayton Hudson prevailed over two other major bidders, the May Department Store Company and Dillard Department Stores, in buying Marshall Field and Company of Chicago, one of the oldest names in American retailing. In 2004, Target sold Marshall Field and another prominent chain, Mervyn's, to May.

 Kenneth Anthony Macke was born in Carroll, Iowa, on Dec. 16, 1938, a son of Leonard and Carol Macke. His father worked for a wholesale candy distributor. At 15, Ken Macke was selling shoes at Anderson's, a local store.

 ''My dad was a born merchant,'' Mr. Macke's son Jeffrey said. ''My dad absolutely loved working on Target and walking the aisles, undercover, at every opportunity.''

 Besides his son Jeffrey, of Bedford, N.Y., Mr. Macke is survived by his wife of 42 years, the former Kathleen O'Farrell; another son, Michael, of Napa, Calif.; a daughter, Melissa Raz of San Francisco; a sister, Judy DeGraeve of Green Bay, Wis.; a brother, Jim, of Carroll, Iowa; and five grandchildren.

 Mr. Macke graduated from Drake University in 1961 and within weeks was a trainee at Dayton Hudson.

 When he retired in 1994, Mr. Macke told The New York Times that it was time to get off the corporate treadmill. ''I have spent my entire career marching to a calendar,'' he said, adding, ''My fondest wish is that I will have the willpower to do nothing.''

 Instead, besides serving on the boards of companies like General Mills, Unisys and Pillsbury, he became a mentor to many small start-up retailers.","Kenneth A.

2008-05-17 00:00:00,35894,"Dick Netzer, an economist who advised mayors of New York City and governors of New York State and served on the first board of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which pried New York City out of bankruptcy in the 1970s, died on May 7 in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Brooklyn and in East Hampton, N.Y.

 His death came after a long illness, his wife, Carol, said.

 Mr. Netzer, who spent much of his career at New York University and became dean of its Graduate School of Public Administration (now the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service), was an expert in public finance, especially as it pertains to state and local government. He wrote widely and voluminously on the arcana of how people are, should and should not be taxed and how the government should, should not and does spend the money. In the 1950s he wrote about tolls, toll roads and highway finance. In the 1960s he wrote a comprehensive analysis of property tax.

 In the 1970s, his book about public support of the arts, ''The Subsidized Muse'' (Cambridge University Press, 1978), argued that government arts financing was generally a good thing but needed to be applied prudently, that money simply flung at arts organizations was both fiscally and culturally irresponsible.

 He served, in the late 1960s, as an adviser to Mayor John V. Lindsay, in the 1970s, to Mayor Abraham D. Beame and Gov. Hugh L. Carey, and in the 1980s, to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. And in June 1975, when the financier Felix Rohatyn and others recommended that the State Legislature create the Municipal Assistance Corporation, an agency with the power to issue bonds backed by portions of the city sales tax, Mr. Netzer joined the board, his deep academic background providing a fiscally conservative anchor. He remained until 1995.

 ''He provided continuity and perspective and placed the crisis in terms of both the city and state's long term financial evolution,'' said Peter Goldmark, who was the state budget director at the time. ''The thing about Dick is that he was a continuing iconic figure. When I first went to work with Mayor Lindsay, Dick Netzer was a god. He was the guy we all looked up to. And he was still that guy in 1985 and 1990.''

 Dick Netzer, who was named for his mother, Sue Dick, was born in Brooklyn on May 14, 1928. His father, Solomon, was a doctor who specialized in the treatment of tuberculosis. He attended New York City public schools and the University of Wisconsin and earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard. He served stateside in the Army during the Korean War.

 In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Ellen Lane of Los Angeles; two daughters, Jenny Netzer, of Cambridge, Mass., and Katherine M. Bunger of Newtown, Conn.; and six grandsons.

 In recalling the fiscal crisis of 1975, Dall W. Forsythe, a professor at the Wagner school who was the state budget director from 1988 to 1991 under Governor Cuomo, said that ''Dick was horrified at what the city had done, and he was absolutely delighted to be part of the solution.'' Now on the Municipal Assistance Corporation board himself, Mr. Forsythe said that the last of the bonds it issued are to be paid off next month, and that the agency will be dissolved, essentially having succeeded itself out of existence.

 ''The city now has a double-A credit rating,'' Mr. Forsythe said. ''It's a great success story. It's too bad Dick didn't make it another month and a half. He could have come to the closing party.''","Dick Netzer, an economist who advised mayors of New York City and governors of New York State and served on the first board of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which pried New York City out of bankruptcy in the 1970s, died on May 7 in Manhattan.","The New York Times                               May 17, 2008 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Dick Netzer, 79, Municipal Finance Expert"
2008-12-28 00:00:00,46559,"Alvah H. Chapman Jr., the former publisher of The Miami Herald and chairman of the Knight Ridder newspapers and one of South Florida's most influential philanthropic and civic leaders, died on Thursday at his home in Miami. He was 87.

 Mr. Chapman died of pneumonia, said his son-in-law Bob Hilton. He had been ill in recent years with Parkinson's disease, had suffered several strokes and had broken a hip in March.

 A newspaperman whose father and grandfather had owned and published newspapers in Florida and Georgia, Mr. Chapman led The Miami Herald and its parent, the Knight Ridder chain of more than 30 newspapers, from 1976 to 1989. Earlier, he had been an innovative general manager of The St. Petersburg Times and publisher of The Savannah Morning News and Evening Press in Georgia.

 Since 1960, when he joined the Knight organization in Miami as an assistant to James L. Knight, Mr. Chapman had over the years become a leader of civic causes in South Florida, taking on scores of tasks, including a $2 billion renewal of downtown Miami, a campaign to rebuild South Miami-Dade and Homestead after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and fund-raising for children, the poor and the homeless.

 At various times, he was chairman of the Florida Philharmonic, president of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, president of Goodwill Industries of South Florida and campaign chairman for what is now the United Way. He led the Orange Bowl Committee, Miami Citizens Against Crime, the city's Coalition for a Drug-Free Partnership and a committee to build the Miami Performing Arts Center.

 He was also chairman of the Florida International University Foundation. The university named its graduate business school after him in 2001.

 Mr. Chapman became president of The Miami Herald in 1969, chief executive of Knight Ridder in 1976 and chairman of the media company, then based in Miami, in 1982. He had helped to orchestrate the merger of Knight Newspapers and Ridder Publications in 1974, the biggest transaction of its kind at the time.

 During his tenure as head of Knight Ridder, corporate revenues tripled, the company's newspapers won 33 Pulitzer Prizes and it obtained Justice Department approval for a joint operating agreement between The Detroit Free Press, owned by Knight Ridder, and its chief competitor, The Detroit News, owned by Gannett.

 He was a courtly man, acquaintances said, remarkably soft-spoken for one who measured his time, got things done on schedule and demanded high standards of subordinates. Tall and athletic, passionate about golfing, boating and fishing, he was always well organized -- and kept those around him organized, too.

 ''When we went boating or fishing as a family, everyone got a three- or four-page description of our duties,'' Mr. Hilton recalled on Saturday. ''There were certain times for things to get done, and we knew it. Frankly, it made things all the more enjoyable. Even when we went fishing, we knew exactly where we were going.''

 Alvah Herman Chapman Jr. was born on Mar. 21, 1921, in Columbus, Ga., where his family owned the R. W. Page Corporation, which operated The Ledger-Enquirer and other newspapers. When he was 5, his father, Alvah Sr., was named publisher of The Bradenton Evening Herald, and the family moved to West Central Florida.

 In high school, Mr. Chapman was a top student, played quarterback on the football team and was editor of the student yearbook. He was voted ''most dependable'' by his classmates, and spoke on Commencement Day in 1938.

 As a teenager, he also worked at his father's newspaper, proofreading the Sunday editions on Saturday afternoons and returning early Sunday to count out newspapers for carriers. He also had a paper route, and on election nights sold soft drinks to crowds that gathered to read the results on a sheet draped from the second floor of City Hall. ''I liked every part of the newspaper business,'' he recalled.

 At the Citadel, the military college of South Carolina in Charleston, he learned martial discipline, leadership and the knack of budgeting time in a regimented atmosphere -- counting the minutes to march to dinner and the hours of homework each evening. He graduated in 1942. (The Alvah H. Chapman chair in business management at the Citadel was endowed in 1989.)

 In 1943, he married the former Betty Bateman. In addition to his wife, Mr. Chapman is survived by two daughters, Chris Hilton, of St. Petersburg, and Dale Webb, of Miami; a sister, Wyline Sayler, of St. Petersburg; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

 During World War II, Mr. Chapman enlisted in the Army Air Corps and became a B-17 bomber pilot. He flew 37 missions over Europe and by the age of 23 was a squadron commander in charge of 29 planes and hundreds of men. Two of his four engines caught fire on one mission, but he brought the plane and crew home safely. He won the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal and a presidential citation.

 After the war, he joined the family business. His father had returned to Columbus to run The Ledger-Enquirer, and he took a job with the paper, eventually rising to business manager. In 1953, he left to become executive vice president and general manager of The St. Petersburg Times, where, with the approval of its legendary publisher, Nelson Poynter, he introduced profit-sharing for employees and the then-novel idea of measuring the performance of workers.

 In 1957, he became publisher of the morning and evening newspapers in Savannah, Ga., and a part owner of Savannah Newspapers. When that organization was sold three years later, he moved to Miami and joined Knight, which owned four publications and had annual revenues of $60 million. As the executive assistant to Mr. Knight, the company's patriarch, he moved quickly up the ranks.

 Mr. Chapman sometimes opposed his own newspaper on issues. He unsuccessfully supported a proposal to build an amusement park on an island in Biscayne Bay, a project opposed editorially by The Herald.

 Long after his retirement, he continued his associations with South Florida civic and cultural causes. After Hurricane Andrew struck in 1992, President George H. W. Bush asked him to organize a task force to rebuild the devastated areas. The result was a community-business partnership called We Will Rebuild.

 The name came from Dollie Buxton, whom he encountered on the porch of her wrecked home in West Perrine, south of Miami.

 ''What are you going to do?'' he asked.

 ''We're going to rebuild,'' she replied.","Alvah H.

2008-04-18 00:00:00,35798,"Hazel Court, a British actress who began as a popular ingenue and became a cult figure as a ''scream queen'' in horror films on both sides of the Atlantic, died on Tuesday in Lake Tahoe, Calif. She was 82 and lived in Lake Tahoe.

 The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter Sally Walsh.

 A redheaded, leggy, green-eyed beauty who was a busy film actress and a pinup girl in England in the 1950s, and who went on to make dozens of guest appearances on American television, Ms. Court had a long and varied professional life, including a second career as a sculptor. But she became best known for showing considerable cleavage and screaming bloody murder in movies like ''Devil Girl From Mars'' (1954), ''The Curse of Frankenstein'' (1957), ''Doctor Blood's Coffin'' (1961) and Roger Corman's treatments of three works by Edgar Allan Poe: ''Premature Burial'' (1962), ''The Raven'' (1963) and ''The Masque of the Red Death'' (1964). In the last two, her best-known films, she co-starred with Vincent Price.

 Her scream-queen roles continued to bring her fan mail -- up to 100 letters a month, Ms. Walsh said -- until her death.

 ''She knew it wasn't serious acting,'' Ms. Walsh said. ''She and Vincent were extremely close, and they found humor in everything. They had a ton of fun, and they didn't take the movies seriously. But she took her fan mail seriously. She was amazed by and touched by it, and she answered every one.''

 Ms. Court was born in Sutton Coldfield, outside Birmingham, England, on Feb. 10, 1926. She began acting on stage as a teenager and first appeared on screen in an uncredited bit part in the 1944 film ''Champagne Charlie.''

 Over the next decade and a half she graduated to featured roles and then to leads, marrying her first husband, the actor Dermot Walsh, along the way. They divorced in 1963, and she later married Don Taylor, the American actor and director, who died in 1998.

 In addition to Ms. Walsh, of Los Angeles, she is survived by another daughter, Courtney Taylor of Ojai, Calif.; a son, Jonathan Taylor of Reno, Nev.; and two stepdaughters, Avery Taylor of San Francisco and Anne Taylor Fleming of Los Angeles.

 Ms. Court first visited the United States in 1958, when CBS imported a television series filmed in London, a crosscultural situation comedy called ''Dick and the Duchess,'' in which she starred with Patrick O'Neal as an English girl married to an American man. She also filmed the first of four episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.''

 Ms. Court eventually relocated to Los Angeles. From 1962 to 1972 she appeared frequently on network television series.

 Her acting career ended in the 1970s. In its place she took up stone sculpturing, studying in Italy and accepting and completing commissions that included one for the library at Pennsylvania State University.

 She also wrote an autobiography, ''Hazel Court: Horror Queen,'' to be published this month by an English publisher, Tomahawk Press. In the book, she wrote that though she might have achieved renown as an actress who shrieked and bled with abandon, she always retained the ladylike primness with which she was raised.

 ''Just in case I should pop off to Heaven in the night, I always remember to wash up, punch up the cushions, and straighten up after a dinner party,'' she wrote. ''I wouldn't want everyone to come in and find it a mess. It's very English of me.''","Hazel Court, a British actress who began as a popular ingenue and became a cult figure as a ''scream queen'' in horror films on both sides of the Atlantic, died on Tuesday in Lake Tahoe, Calif.

2009-11-21 00:00:00,43481,"Herbert J. Miller Jr., who as a Justice Department lawyer in the 1960s relentlessly pursued James R. Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters Union, on jury-tampering and other charges, and later helped negotiate the unconditional pardon of former President Richard M. Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal, died last Saturday in Rockville, Md. He was 85 and lived in Boyds, Md.

 The cause was renal failure, his son John said.

 Mr. Miller, known as Jack, first attracted attention in government circles for his tough-minded work on a court-appointed board supervising the Teamsters. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, a Democrat, ignored the fact that Mr. Miller was a Republican and hired him in 1961 to run the Justice Department's criminal division, where he was encouraged to take on organized crime and Hoffa.

 Mr. Miller, whose favorite pastime was chopping wood, tackled his assignment with gusto, prosecuting organized crime leaders and chasing Hoffa through four indictments, three trials and four appeals, which ended in 1966 with the Supreme Court upholding Hoffa's convictions on charges of jury-tampering and fraud.

 By then Mr. Miller had left the Justice Department and founded his own law firm, Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin, which quickly became one of Washington's two leading criminal-defense firms, along with Williams & Connolly.

 In August 1974, Mr. Miller took on Nixon as a client, having successfully represented several minor figures involved in the Watergate scandals.

 Nixon, who had just resigned as president, faced an uncertain legal future but was in the mood to face his challengers in court and prove that, as he once put it, ''I am not a crook.''

 Mr. Miller told Nixon that he could not get a fair trial and that the case would be likely to drag on for years. He eventually persuaded Nixon to accept a pardon from President Gerald R. Ford, despite its implication of guilt. To clear the way for his client, he said in 1999 in his first public discussion of the case, he sought assurances from Leon Jaworski, the Watergate special prosecutor, that Jaworski would not oppose a pardon, a potential stumbling block that Nixon feared.

 Mr. Miller, who represented Nixon for more than 20 years, also asserted Nixon's ownership rights to the White House tapes and documents, a hotly contested issue that took years to resolve. Before the pardon was granted, an initial compromise was reached under which the material went to the National Archives, where neither Nixon nor archives officials would be allowed access to it without the other's permission.

 Finally, Mr. Miller persuaded Nixon to sign a statement admitting that he had been wrong in ''not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with Watergate, particularly when it reached the state of judicial proceedings.'' The pardon, granted on Sept. 8, 1974, spared Nixon indictment and trial.

 ''He was the ideal attorney for Nixon,'' said John J. Cassidy, a founding partner of Mr. Miller's law firm. ''Nixon was so embattled, so hated, that he needed a strong lawyer to stand beside him, and Jack never flinched. He was fearless.''

 Herbert John Miller Jr. was born on Jan. 11, 1924, in Minneapolis, where his father, a Republican, once worked for the presidential candidate Harold Stassen. He attended the University of Minnesota but joined the Army in his sophomore year and served in an aviation-engineering battalion in New Guinea, the Philippines and Japan.

 After World War II, he resumed his education at George Washington University, earning a law degree in 1949; he then joined the Washington firm now known as Kirkland & Ellis.

 In 1948 he married Carey Kinsolving, who survives him. In addition to his son John K., of Boyds, he is survived by another son, William G., known as Bo, of Nacogdoches, Tex.; and five grandchildren.

 In 1959, a federal judge appointed Mr. Miller to a three-member board created by the court to monitor the Teamsters and Hoffa. Hoffa's lawyer, Edward Bennett Williams, waged an all-out legal assault on the board that Mr. Miller doggedly resisted.

 After being drafted by Robert Kennedy to lead the Justice Department's criminal division, he became a highly visible crusader against organized crime, whose existence was often dismissed as myth. Besides pursuing Mafia and union bosses, he also went after Bobby Baker, a top aide to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was indicted and eventually convicted of tax evasion, theft and conspiracy to commit fraud against the government.

 With two friends, Mr. Miller started Miller, Cassidy & Evans in 1965. One early client was Nascar, whose drivers the Teamsters were trying to unionize.

 When Robert Kennedy mounted his presidential bid in 1968, Mr. Miller worked for him as a campaigner and fund-raiser, and after Kennedy's assassination, he was a pallbearer at his funeral. He went on to represent Edward M. Kennedy immediately after the Chappaquiddick episode, in which Mr. Kennedy, driving home from a party on Chappaquiddick Island, off Martha's Vineyard, veered off a bridge and Mary Jo Kopechne, a young woman in the passenger seat, drowned.

 Despite the Kennedy connection, Mr. Miller did not change parties. In his sole venture into electoral politics, he ran as a Republican for lieutenant governor of Maryland in 1970 but was soundly defeated.

 After working on the Nixon pardon, Mr. Miller continued to defend his client's interests tenaciously. He carried on a long legal struggle to block access to Nixon's presidential tapes and papers, arguing they were private property. In a case that reached the Supreme Court in 1982, he successfully argued that Nixon could not be held civilly liable for acts performed while he was president. Nixon had been sued by a Pentagon employee who claimed he had been fired after testifying about cost overruns.

 ''He's been very successful on behalf of Richard Nixon,'' Alan B. Morrison, the director of the Public Citizen Litigation Group, said in 1986, ''and his purpose has been to keep the public from knowing what's going on.''

 In 1987, Mr. Miller defended Michael K. Deaver, Ronald Reagan's former deputy chief of staff, who had been charged by a special prosecutor with lying under oath about using his influence with the White House as a lobbyist. In what seemed to be a bad miscalculation, Mr. Miller rested his case without calling a single defense witness.

 Deaver, who died in 2007, was found guilty on three counts, but he received only a probationary sentence and went on to re-establish his lobbying career.

 In 2001, Mr. Miller closed Miller, Cassidy, and most of the firm's lawyers joined the firm of Baker, Botts, where James A. Baker, the former secretary of state, is a senior partner.","Herbert J.

2009-06-04 00:00:00,41725,"Ephraim Katzir, Israel's fourth president and one of his nation's pre-eminent scientists, died Saturday at his home on the campus of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. He was 93.

 The death was confirmed by the Web site of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

 Dr. Katzir was president of Israel -- a largely ceremonial post -- from 1973 to 1978. Symbolically, he was head of his nation during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, from Oct. 6 to 26, which began with a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. Israel eventually repelled the Arab forces.

 Four years later, on Nov. 19, 1977, it was President Katzir who officially welcomed President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt on his historic visit to Jerusalem. A somewhat shy and modest man, Dr. Katzir came into public life through tragic circumstances. According to The Jerusalem Post, Prime Minister Golda Meir asked him to submit his name as candidate for the presidency in the spring of 1973 after her first choice for the post, Dr. Katzir's older brother, Aharon, was killed on May 30, 1972, by Japanese terrorists who machine-gunned passengers disembarking at what is now Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv. The brothers -- whose surname at birth was Katchalski -- were both renowned Israeli scientists. Upon becoming president, Ephraim Katchalski Hebraicized his last name to Katzir, which means harvest.

 At the time the Israeli Parliament elected him president, Dr. Katzir was chairman of the biophysics department at the Weizmann Institute. He was one of the founding scientists of the institute, and his brother had been chairman of the institute's department of polymer research.

 Dr. Katzir's initial research centered on simple synthetic protein models that eventually helped to decipher the genetic code and to clarify the various steps in immune responses. He also developed a method for binding enzymes, which catalyze numerous chemical processes, to a variety of surfaces and molecules. The method helped lay the groundwork for what is now called enzyme engineering, which plays an important part in the food and pharmaceutical industries. For his work on immobilized enzymes used in oral antibiotics, he received the Japan Prize in 1985.

 Ephraim Katchalski was born in Kiev, then part of Russia, on May 16, 1916. His parents, Yehuda and Tzila Katchalski, were ardent Zionists. The family emigrated to Palestine, then under British rule, in 1922.

 As an undergraduate at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Dr. Katzir studied botany, zoology and bacteriology before concentrating on biochemistry and organic chemistry. In 1941 he completed his doctoral thesis on simple synthetic polymers of amino acids, research that he continued at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Columbia and Harvard.

 While serving in the Haganah, the underground Jewish defense organization, Dr. Katzir and his brother worked together on developing new explosives for the group. He did research for the Israeli Army's science corps, Hemed, which was established at the start of the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, and later was chief scientist for the Israeli Defense Ministry.

 Dr. Katzir's wife, Nina, died in 1986. He is survived by his son, Meir, and three grandchildren.

 After his term as president, Dr. Katzir returned to research at the Weizmann Institute.","Ephraim Katzir, Israel's fourth president and one of his nation's pre-eminent scientists, died Saturday at his home on the campus of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.","The New York Times                               June 4, 2009 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Ephraim Katzir, 93, Former Israeli President"
2009-06-19 00:00:00,41769,"Paul A. Fino, a former congressman from the Bronx who stoked a long-running feud with Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York in the late 1960s, died Tuesday in North Woodmere, N.Y. He was 95 and lived in Atlantic Beach, on the South Shore of Long Island.

 His death was confirmed by his son, Paul Fino Jr.

 Over a long political career, Mr. Fino was a state senator, a State Supreme Court justice and an eight-term member of the House of Representatives. But he was probably best known for his battles with Mr. Lindsay.

 A usually conservative though sometimes moderate Republican, Mr. Fino had a hard time swallowing what he considered the Manhattan-style elitism of Mr. Lindsay, who was mayor from 1966 through 1973. His needling of the mayor resonated with the mostly Italian and Irish working-class homeowners in what was then the 25th Congressional District in the Bronx. He represented them from 1953 to 1968.

 In 1967, when he was also the chairman of the Bronx Republican Party, Mr. Fino called for all Republicans to oppose Mayor Lindsay, a fellow Republican, and his campaign to promote New York as ''Fun City.''

 On May 18, 1967, Mr. Fino stood on a ladder to finish affixing a 20-by-8-foot billboard beside the Willis Avenue Bridge, which connects Manhattan and the Bronx. The sign read: ''Fun City Line Stops Here'' and ''Republicans of Bronx County Want No Fun Riots, Fun Taxes, Fun Crimes, Fun Mayor.''

 Mr. Fino asserted that the ''cafe society'' mayor was trying to control the Republican Party in the boroughs other than Manhattan to ''further his personal, national political ambitions.'' In 1971, Mr. Lindsay switched to the Democratic Party and began an unsuccessful bid for the 1972 Democratic presidential nomination.

 The rift went back to the two men's days together in Congress. Mr. Lindsay was a staunch liberal. Mr. Fino opposed the Johnson administration's poverty programs, school busing and federal rent subsidies. He introduced legislation to outlaw the Communist Party. Yet at the same time he supported Medicare, called for increased Social Security benefits and sought financing for mass transit programs.

 In 1964 he proposed a national lottery to raise revenue for hospitals. ''The urge to gamble is deeply ingrained in most people,'' he said, adding that a lottery could bring in $10 million a year.

 A dapper cigar-smoking man with a carefully trimmed mustache, Representative Fino was not averse to spectacle. As part of his 1964 re-election campaign, he staged a parade through his district with 45 horses bearing cowboy-attired riders and a band on a truck playing Beatles songs.

 Paul Albert Fino was born in the Bronx on Dec. 15, 1913, one of two children of Isidoro and Lucia Patane Fino. His father was a subway car mechanic. Besides his son, Paul, he is survived by his wife of 70 years, the former Esther Liquori; a daughter, Lucille DiMuro; five grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.

 Mr. Fino attended St. John's University for two years, then received his law degree there in 1937. Three years later he ran unsuccessfully for the State Assembly; running for the State Senate in 1944, he was defeated again.

 After a year as an assistant state attorney general, he ran for the State Senate for a second time and, in an upset, defeated John J. Dunnigan, then the minority leader. He held the Senate seat until 1950, when he was appointed to the city's Civil Service Commission. In 1952, he was elected to Congress.

 After eight terms in the House, Mr. Fino was elected to the State Supreme Court in 1968. In his three years on the bench, he built a reputation for imposing stiff sentences. In 1972, he sentenced a 23-year-old drug addict convicted of selling one-seventy-third of an ounce of heroin to 30 years in prison.

 But as a politician he had a playful side. At the peak of his feud with Mayor Lindsay, Mr. Fino proposed a new verse for the song ''East Side, West Side.'' His version went:

 ''East Side, West Side, all around the town,/Taxes are going up and Lindsay's going down.''","Paul A. Fino, a former congressman from the Bronx who stoked a long-running feud with Mayor John V.

2009-07-14 00:00:00,34727,"John Henry Moss, who as far as anyone knows ran a professional baseball league longer than anyone else, spending half a century in the low minor leagues as president of what is now the South Atlantic League, died in Kings Mountain, N.C., on July 1. He was 90.

 His death was announced by the league, whose president, Eric Krupa, succeeded Mr. Moss last season. No cause of death was given; Mr. Moss had a stroke June 7.

 A stern figure known for his formality and rectitude, Mr. Moss was a businessman at least as much as he was a baseball man. Kings Mountain was his headquarters and his hometown -- he served as the mayor from 1965 to 1988 and was often called Boss Moss -- and he saw minor league baseball as a way to bolster communities, generating local pride as well as local revenue.

 A detail-oriented, forward-looking executive even to the end of his extraordinary tenure, he emphasized the fan experience long before that became a watchword of minor league baseball operations, and he was an early advocate of Internet marketing.

 ''He didn't mind being called a capitalist,'' said Pat O'Conner, the president of Minor League Baseball, who said he knew of no longer-sitting league president. He said he first met Mr. Moss in 1982, when Mr. O'Conner joined the South Atlantic League as the 23-year-old rookie general manager of the Greenwood Pirates and became one of Mr. Moss's many proteges.

 ''John was big on the little things,'' Mr. O'Conner said. ''He'd come to your ballpark, and he'd want to talk about your tickets. What do they look like? Who's selling them? What do you do with your stubs? Now I'm 30 years into it -- I understand why that stuff matters. He had a unique way of looking at things, and he taught a lot of us to do things right.''

 Born on Nov. 10, 1918, Mr. Moss played minor league baseball himself in 1940. Then he joined the Army and served in World War II. Upon his return, he founded the Western Carolina League, a semipro circuit, in 1947. For the 1948 season, having established franchises in North Carolina cities like Shelby, Hendersonville and Lenoir, he won membership for the league in the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (now known as Minor League Baseball). The Western Carolina League was classified as a Class D league, the lowest rung on the professional ladder.

 Mr. Moss left the league in 1950 and for nine years worked as a general manager for several minor league teams affiliated with the Detroit Tigers. The Western Carolina League had been folded into another league in the interim, and when Mr. Moss returned in 1959, he reorganized it as the Western Carolinas League; it shortly rejoined the National Association. In 1980, it was renamed the South Atlantic League (often referred to as the Sally League), and is now classified as a Class A (or single A) league, still in the lower echelons of the minors.

 Under Mr. Moss's leadership, the league expanded in membership and geographical reach, fielding teams at different times in 43 cities. It now has 16 teams in eight states, among them are the colorfully named Kannapolis Intimidators and the Hickory Crawdads in North Carolina, the Delmarva Shorebirds in Maryland and the Savannah Sand Gnats in Georgia. Half the teams play in stadiums built in this century.

 For 45 years, Mr. Moss's wife, Elaine, worked with her husband in the league office as the director of administration and finance. She died in 2004. They had no children.

 Among team owners and executives, Mr. Moss was known for holding long meetings run using Robert's Rules of Order, appearing before them in a well-tailored suit and a necktie even in the warmest weather. He typically brought along a huge notebook that held a detailed agenda, from which he rarely averted his eyes.

 ''But he didn't miss anything,'' said Todd Parnell, a former league official who is now the president of two teams in other leagues. Mr. Parnell recalled a long meeting in which another official stood up, went to his car and returned with a cooler of beer.

 ''He's up there talking, looking down at his notebook. and we're passing the beers around,'' Mr. Parnell said. ''And he doesn't even look up, but he says: 'And gentlemen of the league? The chair will entertain one of those ice-cold beers.'

2010-10-24 00:00:00,19796,"BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) -- Prime Minister David Thompson of Barbados died early Saturday of pancreatic cancer at his private residence in St. Philip, according to a government statement.

 He was 48.

 Mr. Thompson, who became the youngest ever elected prime minister of the Caribbean nation of 270,000 people in January 2008, had been ill since March and traveled to New York several times for treatment. He would not discuss his condition until last month, when his doctor announced that Mr. Thompson had pancreatic cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy.

 In a radio address to the nation last month, Mr. Thompson said he was shuffling his cabinet to pass many of his responsibilities to other ministers. He said he chose the radio for his speech rather than television so islanders would focus on his message, not his appearance.

 Mr. Thompson's attorney general and deputy, Freundel Stuart, was sworn in Saturday as the new prime minister after his nomination by local lawmakers and his appointment by the governor-general of Barbados, Sir Clifford Husbands.

 The prime minister of St. Kitts and Nevis, Denzil Douglas, called Mr. Thompson's death ''a loss to not only the people of Barbados, but also the people of the Caribbean.''

 Trained as a lawyer, Mr. Thompson led his Democratic Labor Party to victory in 2008 elections, defeating an effort by the Barbados Labor Party to win a fourth consecutive term. The party holds 21 of the 30 seats in the Parliament of Barbados, the easternmost Caribbean island.

 The next elections are scheduled for 2012 on the island, which won independence in 1966 and has overcome the decline of its once powerful sugar industry to grow relatively wealthy through high-end tourism, light industry and offshore financial services.

 Mr. Thompson is survived by his wife, Marie-Josephine Mara, and their three daughters.","Prime Minister David Thompson of Barbados died early Saturday of pancreatic cancer at his private residence in St. Philip, according to a government statement.","The New York Times                              October 24, 2010 Sunday                               Late Edition - Final  David Thompson, 48, Dies; Barbados Prime Minister"
2010-07-27 00:00:00,19525,"Nathan Quinones, who as the chancellor of the New York City school system in the mid-1980s pushed to reduce dropout rates and institute tougher achievement standards but who resigned six months before the end of his term in the face of public pressure, died Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. He was 79.

 The cause was a stroke, his daughter Adria Quinones said.

 Mr. Quinones had been a language teacher, principal and administrator for 27 years in the city school system when he became chancellor in 1984. He succeeded Anthony J. Alvarado, who resigned because of financial irregularities after serving one year. Mr. Quinones served three and a half years.

 Under Mr. Quinones, test scores somewhat improved, overcrowding in classrooms eased and, by some measures, the dropout rate fell. He started a program to teach students about racism and established, in Lower Manhattan, the Harvey Milk High School, which was intended to be sensitive to the needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students. He closed a junior high school in the Bronx for unacceptable attendance and achievements.

 Mr. Quinones (pronounced key-NYO-nas) announced his resignation in August 1987, effective Jan. 1, 1988, six months before his contract expired. Early in his tenure, he was criticized as politically clumsy in lobbying for bigger school budgets. Later, business leaders complained that high school graduates were not well educated for the workplace.

 Many criticized Mr. Quinones as not being sufficiently adroit at working with the Board of Education, which oversaw education in the city then, and as ineffective in slicing through the school bureaucracy. (The schools are now controlled by the mayor.)

 During her campaign for mayor in 1985, the City Council president, Carol Bellamy, demanded his ouster, saying Mr. Quinones had ''consistently failed to provide the leadership or sound management we need.''

 Mayor Edward I. Koch contended that Mr. Quinones's low-key manner had hurt him politically.

 ''I think we're losing a first-rate chancellor,'' Mr. Koch said in an interview with The New York Times in 1987. ''He has a very sedate kind of style. He's not a pushy guy. But he's a very courageous man, and he is very intelligent, very experienced. I think he was on the right track. I only regret that others were not supportive of him.''

 Mr. Quinones was born in East Harlem on Oct. 12, 1930, to Puerto Rican parents who had to rely on public assistance in the 1940s. While attending City College, where he majored in classical and romance languages, he worked six nights a week at a hospital. He graduated in 1953.

 After serving in the Army in Korea, he got a master's degree from Columbia University.

 Mr. Quinones joined the school system as a foreign-language teacher in 1957 and was assistant principal in charge of foreign languages at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Queens when he was named principal of South Bronx High School in 1977. Frank J. Macchiarola, the chancellor before Mr. Alvarado, appointed him chief of the city's high schools, ahead of many more experienced principals.

 In addition to his daughter, Adria, Mr. Quinones is survived by his wife, the former Romana Martinez; two other daughters, Daria Quinones and Cyra Borsy; and three grandchildren.

 In an interview with Newsday in 1988, Mr. Quinones said he felt so relieved when he resigned that he found himself singing as he walked down the street.

 ''I felt like a little bird,'' he said. ''I was amused. I never sing.''","Nathan Quinones, who as the chancellor of the New York City school system in the mid-1980s pushed to reduce dropout rates and institute tougher achievement standards but who resigned six months before the end of his term in the face of public pressure, died Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y.","The New York Times                               July 27, 2010 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Nathan Quinones, 79, Dies; Led New York City Schools"
2010-11-04 00:00:00,19836,"MOSCOW -- Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who served as Russia's prime minister during the turbulent transition to a free-market economy in the 1990s and who founded the state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom, died Wednesday morning, the Russian government announced. He was 72.

 No cause was released.

 President Boris N. Yeltsin appointed Mr. Chernomyrdin prime minister in 1992, and he remained in that post through the most painful years of economic turmoil. Initially a champion of market reform, he later let it be known that he thought Western economic theory had done ''more harm than good.''

 A former Soviet oil and gas minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin (pronounced churn-o-MEER-dihn) resisted pressure from reformers to split the gas industry into smaller companies, as the oil and metals industries had done. That decision originated the blend of state and capitalism that came into vogue under Vladimir V. Putin.

 Mr. Chernomyrdin was recalled in Russia on Wednesday as a crucial mediating figure in a country caught between young, inexperienced reformers and the old guard of the Soviet elite.

 ''Chernomyrdin turned out to be the strongest, most effective and flexible bridge for the extraordinary work of our generation: raising and building a new Russia from the ruins of the totalitarian Soviet system,'' said Gennadi E. Burbulis, a former Yeltsin adviser and deputy in Russia's lower house of Parliament.

 Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin was born on April 9, 1938, at the height of Stalin's purges in a village in the central Russian Orenburg region. The son of a rural truck driver, he worked as a machine operator at an oil refinery and graduated from a technical institute through correspondence courses. He then rose through the ranks in the Soviet gas industry, becoming minister the year Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power.

 He remained in charge in 1989, when the ministry was transformed into Gazprom, and made sure its assets stayed intact. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the supply of heating gas to apartments was never cut off, an accomplishment that the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta credited to the fact that ''sly Viktor Chernomyrdin managed to 'rebrand' '' the gas ministry and protect it from perestroika-era pressure to sell it off.

 He enriched himself and his family in the process.

 In 2001, Mr. Chernomyrdin was ranked No. 8 on Forbes magazine's list of Russian billionaires, with $1.1 billion. His garage housed a fleet of luxury cars, according to a financial statement on the Kremlin Web site.

 Mr. Chernomyrdin was famous for malapropisms, as when he told Parliament, ''Government is not the organ in which one uses his tongue only,'' or instructed his detractors, ''If your hands are itchy, scratch yourselves in other spots,'' or declared, ''We will live so well that our children and grandchildren will envy us!''

 But former colleagues remembered a steely politician who helped anchor an often wayward government.

 Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, a former member of Parliament, recalled the day in 1993 when a standoff between Mr. Yeltsin and members of Parliament had brought Russia near civil war. Mr. Chernomyrdin called a meeting with leaders of all of Russia's regions via speakerphone, chatting casually about coal stockpiles and pension payments and the weather.

 ''Then Chernomyrdin says: 'O.K., guys. You know what's going on in Moscow. I'll tell you what. I am the prime minister, and I have seven ministers sitting here next to me. We have a president, Boris Nikolayevich. He was popularly elected, we are supporting him. Get to work, support the president and don't make any unnecessary movements,' '' Mr. Ryzhkov recalled in a radio interview.

 He said this meeting, which was never made public, was the ''decisive moment'' in the crisis.

 Two years later, Mr. Chernomyrdin negotiated with the Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev, who was holding up to 2,000 hostages in the city of Budyonnovsk. The negotiations were carried live on television, and Russians watched in frozen horror as Mr. Chernomyrdin barked into the phone at Mr. Basayev.

 Most of the hostages were released, and Russians credited him.

 ''It was incredible,'' Katya Amachenova, a secretary, told The New York Times at the time.

 She added: ''He was very calm. He acted like a leader. We haven't seen that in a while.''

 While serving as prime minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin remained so closely associated with Gazprom that the political party he founded, Our Home is Russia, was jokingly referred to as ''Our Home is Gazprom.'' His company was allowed to expand lavishly despite falling behind on tax payments. It also stepped in to assist the Kremlin at key moments, foreclosing on the media empire of Vladimir A. Gusinsky, who had turned into a sharp critic, and putting pressure on neighboring countries like Georgia and Ukraine when they fell behind on payments.

 Mr. Yeltsin fired Mr. Chernomyrdin as prime minister in 1998, but tried to bring him back as the country spiraled into economic crisis. By that point, however, the president's authority was on the wane, and Parliament blocked Mr. Chernomyrdin's appointment.

 When Mr. Putin came to power, he replaced Mr. Chernomyrdin as chairman of Gazprom with a little-known adviser, Dmitri A. Medvedev. Largely shut out of the halls of power, Mr. Chernomyrdin put his experience in the oil and gas industry to use as ambassador to Ukraine, whose pipelines carry Russian gas to Europe. From 2001 until his retirement in 2009, he played a crucial role in disputes over natural gas prices that caused energy flows to Europe to be shut off on several occasions.

 Mr. Chernomyrdin's funeral will be shown live on Russian television. Burial will be in the Novodevichy cemetery, alongside such figures as Khrushchev, Chekhov and Mr. Yeltsin.

 Mr. Chernomyrdin is survived by two sons. His wife of 50 years, Valentina, died in March, a loss that those close to the former prime minister said affected him deeply.

 Mr. Chernomyrdin will long be remembered for his fatalistic commentary on a botched monetary overhaul carried out by the Russian Central Bank in 1993: ''We wanted to do it better,'' he declared at a news conference, ''but it turned out as usual.''","Viktor S.

2010-09-10 00:00:00,19656,"Thomas Guinzburg, an editor and publisher who helped create The Paris Review, the enduring lion of American literary magazines, and who later became president of Viking Press, the publishing house founded by his father, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 84.

 The cause was complications of heart bypass surgery, his former wife Rusty Unger said.

 Mr. Guinzburg, a former decorated Marine who survived the battle of Iwo Jima in World War II, had recently graduated from Yale when he moved to Paris in the early 1950s. His crowd there, a now famous band of literary expatriates, included his Yale roommate, Peter Matthiessen, George Plimpton, William Styron and Donald Hall.

 In 1953 he teamed up with Mr. Plimpton, Mr. Matthiessen and others as founders of The Paris Review, a journal that propelled the early careers of writers as diverse as Adrienne Rich, Philip Roth, V. S. Naipaul, Jack Kerouac, Mona Simpson and T. Coraghessan Boyle.

 Having been the managing editor of The Yale Daily News (when William F. Buckley Jr. was chairman), Mr. Guinzburg was named the first managing editor of The Paris Review; he eventually became president of its board of directors.

 ''He was the only one of us who had any publishing expertise; the Yale paper was a pretty good paper,'' Mr. Matthiessen said on Thursday, adding that as a reader, Mr. Guinzburg possessed the natural publisher's gift of having no agenda: ''He had no axes to grind. He just had very good taste.''

 Robert B. Silvers, editor of The New York Review of Books and a board member of The Paris Review, said: ''He was a marvelous combination of idealist and realist. He was always encouraging The Review not to be deterred from discovering young writers of quality. At the same time he had a grasp of the really rough details of commercial publishing.''

 Mr. Guinzburg joined Viking Press, starting in the publicity department, in 1954. His father, Harold K. Guinzburg, had founded Viking in 1925 with a partner, George S. Oppenheimer, with the goal of publishing nonfiction and ''distinguished fiction with some claim to permanent importance rather than ephemeral popular interest.'' Its author list -- which included John Steinbeck, Graham Greene, Arthur Miller and Saul Bellow -- upheld the ambition.

 The elder Mr. Guinzburg died in 1961, and Thomas took over as president. In 1975 he arranged the sale of Viking to Pearson Longman, a British media company that owned Penguin Books. Mr. Guinzburg remained president of a newly named house, Viking/Penguin, until 1978.

 Mr. Guinzburg was known for his editorial staff; he hired many of publishing's most respected editors, including Corlies Smith, Aaron Asher and Elisabeth Sifton. In 1975 he hired Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who lasted two years before resigning over the publication of a political thriller called ''Shall We Tell the President?''

 In that book, the author, Jeffrey Archer, a former member of the British Parliament, imagined Edward M. Kennedy as the president of the United States and an assassination plot against him. Mrs. Onassis did not edit the book -- or, evidently, read it -- but knew of it and had told Mr. Guinzburg that she would not object to its publication. John Leonard, however, lambasting the book in a review in The New York Times, took barely disguised aim at her.

 ''There is a word for such a book,'' Mr. Leonard wrote. ''The word is trash. Anybody associated with its publication should be ashamed of herself.''

 Mrs. Onassis resigned shortly afterward.

 Mr. Guinzburg had many successes, however. During his tenure, Viking published nonfiction by, among many others, Hannah Arendt, Nat Hentoff and Barbara W. Tuchman, and fiction by Ken Kesey, Jimmy Breslin, Patrick White, Lawrence Durrell, Kingsley Amis, Iris Murdoch, Robert Coover and others. He published Thomas Pynchon's ''Gravity's Rainbow,'' which won the National Book Award in 1974.

 Thomas Henry Guinzburg was born in Manhattan on March 30, 1926. He graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, then served in the Marines during the war before attending Yale.

 According to ''The Time of Their Lives,'' a 2008 book by Al Silverman about independent publishers, Mr. Guinzburg had his first inkling that the book business was in his future at age 9, when his father gave him the manuscript of the children's classic ''Ferdinand the Bull.'' He liked it so much, he told his father that he wanted to read it again.

 ''Four million copies later, the experience made me feel like I might someday be suited for my father's profession,'' Mr. Guinzburg said.

 Mr. Guinzburg was married and divorced twice. Steinbeck was his best man at his second wedding, to Ms. Unger. He and his first wife, the actress Rita Gam, had two children who survive him, Kate Guinzburg, a movie producer, and Michael Guinzburg, a novelist, both of Los Angeles. He is also survived by his daughter with Ms. Unger, Amanda Guinzburg, of Bridgehampton, N.Y.; two granddaughters; and his companion for the past 15 years, Victoria Anstead.

 After he left Viking Mr. Guinzburg devoted much of his time to charity work, including sponsoring Brooklyn students in Eugene M. Lang's ''I Have a Dream'' program, which provides college-education funding for children who agree to remain in school and earn a high school diploma. He was also a founder of the Dream Team, a program of the fund-raising arm of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which fulfills wishes for adult cancer patients.

 An inveterate sports fan -- he was listening to the United States Open when he died, Ms. Anstead said -- Mr. Guinzburg had a robust sense of humor and may be best known for engineering one of publishing's most legendary stunts. On the occasion of Mr. Pynchon's receiving the National Book Award, Mr. Guinzburg arranged for the comic actor Professor Irwin Corey to accept the award for the famously reclusive author. Mr. Corey's speech, a lunatic and somewhat inspired ramble -- he referred to Mr. Pynchon as Richard Python -- was received with astonished guffaws, as he dealt mostly with American politics, though at one point he thanked Mr. Guinzburg, saying that he had ''made it possible for you people to be here this evening to enjoy the Friction Citation.''","Thomas Guinzburg, an editor and publisher who helped create The Paris Review, the enduring lion of American literary magazines, and who later became president of Viking Press, the publishing house founded by his father, died on Wednesday in Manhattan.","The New York Times                             September 10, 2010 Friday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  Thomas Guinzburg, 84, Paris Review Co-Founder, Dies"
2010-06-25 00:00:00,9707,"Prescott S. Bush Jr., the brother of one president and uncle of another, and a retired insurance executive who tried but never made it far in the family business -- politics -- died Wednesday after a long illness. He was 87.

 Mr. Bush's death was confirmed by Tracey Bergonzi, a spokeswoman at Keohane Funeral Home in Hingham, Mass., a town where Mr. Bush had lived for several years. The cause of death was unclear.

 Besides being the uncle of one president, George W. Bush, and elder brother of another, George Bush, he was the son of a wealthy senator, Prescott S. Bush. Mr. Bush spent much of his career as a businessman, but dabbled in local politics in his home state, Connecticut, for many years, at one point serving as a Republican committee chairman in Greenwich.

 And yet in many ways, Mr. Bush, who was born with the use of only one eye, lived in the shadow of his younger brother. Mr. Bush preceded his brother by two years at the prestigious Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., then at Yale, where George Bush became president of his class, captain of the baseball team, and a member of the secret society Skull and Bones.

 Prescott Bush Jr. dropped out of college in 1943 to move to South America, where he worked for Pan American Airways, before returning to work on Wall Street. Mr. Bush joined an insurance brokerage firm, Johnson & Higgins, in 1952, and later became a partner, making the daily commute to New York from his home in Greenwich.

 But in 1982, with his brother serving as vice president under Ronald Reagan, Mr. Bush sought to take advantage of the family name and enter politics on a grand stage, challenging Lowell P. Weicker, a veteran Connecticut senator who had won nine elections in a row and had never been defeated. Mr. Bush fumbled initially, occasionally forgetting lines on the campaign trail and causing a stir when he joked about illegal immigrants being needed in Greenwich to clean houses.

 But he soon won a large following, and rather than hide from his wealthy upbringing or play it down, he spoke of being lucky to come from such circumstances and told audiences he had been taught by his father that he should give back to society through public service. During the race, he repeatedly made the point that he understood the problems of poor Americans because he had worked with charities in tough neighborhoods.

 Mr. Bush stunned many across the state when he won resoundingly in a Republican caucus in Fairfield in March 1982. But by the end of July, just five weeks before the Republican primary, Mr. Bush issued another stunner when he abruptly dropped out of the race.

 ''Accusations had been slowly building that he was too much like his father, in the sense that he hadn't had a lengthy interest in public service but simply seemed to have seized a political opening now that he was in the financial position to mount a well-funded campaign,'' Bill Minutaglio wrote in his biography of George W. Bush, ''First Son.''

 ''It was of course the same nettlesome criticism leveled against his brother and his nephew in Texas -- that the Bushes were running because it was what the Bushes did, that the Bushes were craving public office not because they were driven by a burning ideology but because it was their situation in life,'' Mr. Minutaglio wrote.

 Years later, Mr. Bush would go on to found a nonprofit organization that encourages trade and investment in China.

 ''Above all else, he was a devoted family man whose philanthropy started at home,'' the Bush family said in a statement obtained by The Associated Press. He ''loved life, family and friends and lived with a spirit of abundance.''

 According to The A.P., he is survived by his wife of 66 years, Elizabeth; his son, James Bush; a daughter, Kelsey Bush-Nadeau; and six grandchildren.","Prescott S.

2011-09-18 00:00:00,49473,"Eleanor Mondale Poling, a former television and radio personality and the daughter of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, died early Saturday at her farm in Prior Lake, Minn. She was 51.

 The cause was brain cancer, which she had been battling since 2005, her family said.

 ''She was a wonderful daughter,'' Mr. Mondale said in a telephone interview from his daughter's home, where relatives and friends had gathered. ''A great spirit, a lot of courage. She fought this stuff almost six years now, and never a whimper.''

 Eleanor Jane Mondale was born in Minneapolis on Jan. 19, 1960, the second of three children of Mr. Mondale and his wife, Joan. When she was 4, her father was appointed to the Senate seat vacated by Hubert H. Humphrey, who had become President Lyndon B. Johnson's vice president.

 She graduated from St. Timothy's School in Maryland and St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y. In college and soon afterward, she spent time in Los Angeles auditioning for television and movie roles, landing small parts in several TV shows, including ''Three's Company'' and ''Dynasty.''

 She also appeared on the campaign trail, stumping for her father in 1984 during his failed campaign to unseat President Ronald Reagan.

 Ms. Mondale told Newsweek in 1985 that having a famous father was a double-edged sword in Hollywood. ''The exposure didn't hurt,'' she said. ''But being Walter Mondale's daughter doesn't make me a good actress. I have to prove myself five times over. I have to overcompensate.''

 Ms. Mondale began her broadcasting career in the late 1980s as a radio D.J. in Chicago. In 1989, she became an entertainment reporter at WCCO-TV in Minneapolis. She later worked as a D.J. at WLOL-FM, a Minneapolis radio station, and as an on-air personality at the E! Online cable channel, ESPN and ''This Morning'' on CBS.

 In 2005, she suffered two seizures during a camping trip and received a diagnosis of brain cancer. A year later, after receiving chemotherapy and radiation, she returned to the air as a host of a weekday morning radio show on WCCO-AM in Minneapolis.

 In March 2009 she gave up those duties, announcing that the cancer had returned. She underwent surgery to remove a tumor that August.

 Ms. Mondale found her way into the gossip columns at an early age. In 1977, when she was 17, she attracted the attention of photographers when she wore a tuxedo to an inaugural ball for President Jimmy Carter.

 Over the years, she was romantically linked to various celebrities, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Warren Zevon and Don Henley, as well as the financier Ronald O. Perelman. She was married three times, first to Keith Van Horne, a former tackle for the Chicago Bears, in 1988; then to Greg Malban, a D.J. known as Greg Thunder, in 1991. In 2005 she married Chan Poling, a musician and composer, and took his last name.

 The couple lived on a small farm, where they kept a menagerie of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, a cockatoo and chickens, according to a photo spread in a 2005 issue of Country Living magazine. The chickens were kept in a corner of the barn decorated with an antique chandelier. Ms. Poling called the coop ''Cluckingham Palace.''

 In addition to Mr. Poling and her parents, Ms. Poling is survived by her brothers, Ted Mondale, a former Minnesota state senator, and William H. Mondale, a former assistant attorney general of Minnesota.

2011-07-23 00:00:00,49296,"Bruce G. Sundlun, a former Democratic governor of Rhode Island whose tenure was marked by dramatic events both public and private, including a statewide banking crisis on his first day in office and a lawsuit -- happily resolved -- by a Midwestern teenager who said she was his daughter, died on Thursday at his home in Jamestown, R.I. He was 91.

 His family announced the death, The Associated Press reported.

 A millionaire who made his fortune in telecommunications, Mr. Sundlun cut a larger-than-life figure that seemed inversely proportional to the size of his state. He was a multiply decorated war hero. He had multiple homes. He had multiple marriages and multiple divorces. His exploits were widely chronicled by the local and national news media.

 He was combustible, confrontational and combative. ''One of his printable nicknames was 'Captain Blowhard,' '' The Providence Journal noted in a blog on Thursday.

 Mr. Sundlun served two terms as governor from 1991 to 1995, a period of deep economic recession in the region. The public drama began on the first day of his first term.

 On Jan. 1, 1991, less than an hour after being sworn in, Mr. Sundlun announced that he was closing 45 of the state's banks and credit unions because their private insurer, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation, had collapsed. (Mostly small, local institutions, they had not been insured through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.)

 Both widely praised and widely condemned, the governor's action froze more than $1 billion in the accounts of 300,000 depositors -- nearly a third of the state's population. A year and a half of vitriolic public protests ensued, including one in which Mr. Sundlun was burned in effigy.

 The money was eventually returned through a taxpayer-financed bailout plan overseen by Mr. Sundlun.

 Bruce George Sundlun was born in Providence, R.I., on Jan. 19, 1920, into a Jewish family that had come from Lithuania. His parents, Walter Irving Sundlun and the former Jan Zelda Colitz, owned a jewelry store in Pawtucket, R.I.

 After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Bruce Sundlun enlisted in the Army Air Corps and became a bomber pilot in Europe. In 1943, his B-17 was shot down and he parachuted into occupied Belgium. He made his way to France, where he joined the Maquis, a rural guerrilla arm of the Resistance. With them, he made nighttime raids on German convoys near the Swiss border.

 For his wartime service, he was awarded a Purple Heart, a Distinguished Flying Cross and an Air Medal with oak leaf cluster. France named him a chevalier of the Legion of Honor.

 After the war, Mr. Sundlun earned a bachelor's degree from Williams College and a law degree from Harvard. He was an assistant United States attorney in Washington before going into business.

 In the 1970s, Mr. Sundlun became president and chief executive of the Outlet Company, a Providence-based retail and broadcasting concern founded in the 19th century. Under his stewardship, the company shifted its focus exclusively to broadcasting. Renamed Outlet Communications, it eventually owned more than a dozen radio and television stations.

 Mr. Sundlun first ran for governor in 1986 and was defeated in the general election by the Republican candidate, Edward D. DiPrete; Mr. DiPrete defeated him again two years later. In 1990, Mr. Sundlun defeated Mr. DiPrete in a landslide, winning 74 percent of the vote.

 In 1993, during his second term in office, Mr. Sundlun, then 73, was sued by Kara Hewes, a 17-year-old Michigan girl he had never met. In the 1970s, Mr. Sundlun, who was single at the time, had had a relationship with her mother, Judith Hewes.

 In a paternity suit filed in Michigan, Kara Hewes asserted that Mr. Sundlun was her biological father and sought financial support from him. A week later, Mr. Sundlun and Kara, smiling broadly and holding hands, appeared at a news conference to announce a settlement. Under its terms, he acknowledged Kara as his daughter and agreed to pay her college tuition.

 The story had an even happier coda in 2003, when Mr. Sundlun's daughter, by then television newscaster known as Kara Sundlun, was married in Newport, R.I. Her father, who was 83 at the time, walked her down the aisle. Ms. Sundlun is now an anchor at WFSB, a CBS affiliate in Hartford.

 In 1994, Mr. Sundlun ran for a third term as governor but was defeated in the Democratic primary. He later taught political science at the University of Rhode Island.

 Mr. Sundlun's first four marriages -- to Madeleine Schiffer Eisner, Pamela Soldwedel Barrett, Joyanne Carter and Marjorie Lee -- ended in divorce. Besides his daughter, Kara, his survivors include his fifth wife, Soozie Dittelman; three sons from his first marriage, Tracy, Stuart and Peter; stepchildren; grandchildren; and stepgrandchildren.

 For all the bluster of his public persona, Mr. Sundlun was not entirely without self-knowledge.

 ''Just last week, a guy wrote in The Providence Journal that I was -- and I quote -- 'boorish, aloof, and, at times, inappropriate,' '' he told the newspaper in an interview last year. ''My first reaction was, 'So what?' ''","Bruce G.

2011-07-24 00:00:00,49302,"Charles T. Manatt, a lawyer who founded one of the country's largest law firms and served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the Reagan administration, died on Friday of complications stemming from a stroke. He was 75.

 Mr. Manatt took the reins of the Democratic Party in 1981, when few people wanted the job. The party was in debt and reeling from a sound defeat by Ronald Reagan. Mr. Manatt guided it to fiscal strength, expanding the mailing list and overseeing construction of a permanent headquarters in Washington.

 ''We'd lost seats in the Congress, the Senate was under the control of the Republicans, we had a conservative group of Democrats who sided with Reagan in 1981,'' recalled Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat. ''But Chuck was optimistic and served to galvanize people.''

 Terry McAuliffe, a later Democratic national chairman, said that Mr. Manatt rewrote party rules and used his appointment power to make the party more inclusive, giving Geraldine A. Ferraro, for example, a prominent place on the platform committee.

 Mr. Manatt became such a popular figure within the party that an unsuccessful attempt by Walter F. Mondale, the presumptive presidential nominee, to replace him before the convention in 1984 was viewed as a serious blunder.

 Still, Mr. Manatt was unable to engineer a comeback to defeat President Reagan in 1984, and when his term expired the following year, the party was still viewed as in need of an image overhaul.

 Mr. Manatt served as co-chairman of Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, and he was rewarded with an ambassadorship to the Dominican Republic.

 ''We were friends for 30 years,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement, ''and I saw firsthand how he used his energy, intellect, and common sense to help restore the Democratic Party after 1980, to make America more prosperous and just, and to make friends for our nation around the world.''

 Mr. Manatt was born in Chicago on June 9, 1936, to Price Manatt and Lucille Taylor Manatt, and he grew up in Iowa, where his father farmed and his mother taught school.

 In 1965, Mr. Manatt and Thomas Phelps, a friend from college, founded the law firm now called Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. Today the firm has offices in eight cities and employs 350 lawyers. At first, the firm specialized in savings and loan law but ultimately developed an entertainment law practice whose clients include TimeWarner, DreamWorks, and the estates of Truman Capote and Andy Warhol, a spokeswoman for the firm said.

 He is survived by his wife, Kathy, whom he had known since elementary school and been married to for 53 years; their three children, Michele, Timothy and Daniel; and three grandchildren.","Charles T.

2011-07-09 00:00:00,49247,"Betty Ford, the outspoken and much-admired wife of President Gerald R. Ford who overcame alcoholism and an addiction to pills and helped found one of the best-known rehabilitation centers in the nation, died Friday in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 93.

 Her death was confirmed by Chris Chase, Mrs. Ford's biographer.

 The news of her death at Eisenhower Medical Center brought statements of condolence from President Obama, former Presidents George Bush, George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, and Nancy Reagan, the former first lady.

 ''She was Jerry Ford's strength through some very difficult days in our country's history,'' Mrs. Reagan said, ''and I admired her courage in facing and sharing her personal struggles with all of us.''

 Few first ladies have been as popular as Betty Ford, and it was her frankness and lack of pretense that made her so. She spoke often in support of the Equal Rights Amendment, endorsed legalized abortion, discussed premarital sex and revealed that she intended to share a bed with her husband in the White House.

 When her husband's voice failed him the morning after he was defeated by Jimmy Carter in 1976, it was she who read the official concession statement with smiling grace. And when Mr. Ford died in December 2006, it was Mrs. Ford who announced his death. The six days of national mourning returned her to a spotlight she had tried to avoid in her later years, living in Rancho Mirage, Calif., a golf community southeast of Palm Springs, and tending to her clinic there, the Betty Ford Center.

 The country's affection for Betty Ford transcended party lines. It began in earnest slightly more than two months after Gerald Ford became president in August 1974, following President Richard M. Nixon's resignation over Watergate. Mr. Ford had been vice president for less than 10 months, named by Nixon to succeed Spiro T. Agnew, who had resigned in disgrace over accusations of bribery and tax evasion. On Sept. 28, 1974, Mrs. Ford had a radical mastectomy after doctors discovered cancer in her right breast.

 Courage Against Cancer

 Within days, 10,000 letters, more than 500 telephone calls, more than 200 telegrams and scores of floral arrangements poured into the White House and into her suite at Bethesda Naval Hospital. In the months that followed, tens of thousands of American women, inspired by Mrs. Ford's forthrightness and courage in facing her illness, crowded into doctors' offices and clinics for breast-cancer examinations.

 After leaving the hospital, Mrs. Ford underwent chemotherapy treatment for two years. In November 1976, her physician announced that she had made a complete recovery.

 Mrs. Ford was once asked if she felt sorry for herself during the trauma of losing her breast.

 ''No! Oh, no -- heavens, no,'' she replied. ''I've heard women say they'd rather lose their right arm, and I can't imagine it. It's so stupid. I can even wear my evening clothes.''

 She advised women facing such an operation to ''go as quickly as possible and get it done.''

 ''Once it's done,'' she said, ''put it behind you and go on with your life.''

 Breast cancer was only one of the medical battles Mrs. Ford won.

 Confronting Addiction

 Her dependency on pills began in 1964 with a medical prescription to relieve constant pain from a neck injury and a pinched nerve. Her drinking, which became troublesome as she was faced with her husband's frequent absences on political business, grew increasingly serious as Mr. Ford's Congressional career advanced. Her loneliness was compounded by low self-esteem and a debilitating self-consciousness about things like her lack of a college degree.

 ''Now I know that some of the pain I was trying to wipe out was emotional,'' she recalled in ''Betty: A Glad Awakening'' (1987), the second volume of her autobiography written with Ms. Chase. Going back to the days when her husband was a Michigan congressman and minority leader in the House of Representatives, she remembered that ''on one hand, I loved being 'the wife of'; on the other hand, I was convinced that the more important Jerry became, the less important I became.''

 In 1978, the year after leaving the White House, her husband, children, doctors and several friends confronted her about her drinking and her abuse of pills. She refused to acknowledge that a problem existed, calling her family ''a bunch of monsters,'' but she eventually entered the Long Beach Naval Hospital in California for treatment.

 The Betty Ford Center, dedicated on Oct. 3, 1982, was a direct result of Mrs. Ford's victory over her alcoholism and addiction. Set on 14 acres on the campus of the Eisenhower Medical Center 11 miles southeast of Palm Springs, the center was a nonprofit venture spearheaded by Mrs. Ford and Leonard K. Firestone, an industrialist and former ambassador to Belgium who raised a major part of the money.

 The center's philosophy, drawn from the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous, is based on peer interaction and learning to identify and express feelings. Many celebrities, including Elizabeth Taylor, Liza Minnelli, Mary Tyler Moore, Mickey Mantle and Darryl Strawberry, spent time there.

 ''It's hard to make anyone understand what it's like to have your name on something, to be given credit for things you haven't done,'' Mrs. Ford wrote. ''I've been at meetings where someone turned and thanked me, and I hugged the person and said, 'Don't thank me, thank yourself, you're the one who did it, with God's help.' From the beginning, we have wanted every patient at the center to feel, 'I'm important here, I have some dignity.' ''

 Betty Ford was good at doing the things that every first lady does: accompanying her husband on tours and public ceremonies and holding dinners and parties. Her parties usually lasted past midnight as she danced from one partner to another.

 But unlike many other wives of presidents, Mrs. Ford rarely hesitated to make public her views on touchy subjects. She held a White House news conference announcing her support of the Equal Rights Amendment; the mail response ran three to one against her. In 1975, appearing on ''60 Minutes,'' she said she ''wouldn't be surprised'' if her daughter, Susan, had a premarital affair; the mail was four to one against her. Her husband jokingly told her later that the comment had cost him 20 million votes in the 1976 election, she said.

 A decade later, reminiscing with Margaret Truman for Ms. Truman's book ''First Ladies,'' she voiced regret over that television appearance. Later that year, despite her advocacy for abortion rights, she reined herself in. She said nothing about the Republican platform that called for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.

 She also told Ms. Truman that she had warned her husband not to pardon Nixon, a more definitive statement than one she made in ''The Times of My Life'' (1978), the first volume of Mrs. Ford's autobiography. In that book she said she had known that a pardon would be unpopular but that she had supported it anyway.

 ''I think it had to be done,'' she wrote. Nevertheless, she said, she believed it cost her husband the election.

 Mrs. Ford said she had been influential in President Ford's appointments of Carla Hills as secretary of housing and urban development and Anne Armstrong as ambassador to Britain. She was unsuccessful, however, in urging him to appoint a woman to the Supreme Court.

 She was, in her own words, ''more of a hawk'' than her children on the war in Vietnam. Although she said she believed men and women should give two years of service to the country, she confessed she was ''very relieved'' when her sons drew high draft-lottery numbers.

 A Relaxed White House

 Mrs. Ford brought a relaxed touch to the White House within days of moving in. She asked why the staff never returned a greeting and was told that President Nixon and the first lady, Pat Nixon, had preferred them to be as silent and invisible as possible. An immediate change went into effect, to the degree that during family meals the president and the butler compared golf scores. And when Mrs. Ford returned from her mastectomy, the staff lined up with signs reading, ''We love you, Betty.''

 She disliked other manifestations of Mrs. Nixon's formal tastes, particularly the choice of stiff furniture, which had replaced the more comfortable Kennedy ambience from the early '60s. Although she left the decor as it was, she could not resist a bit of deviltry. A ceramic bowl in the Yellow Oval Room was supported by two Greek goddesses, one of them with her hands out. ''Every time I went through,'' Mrs. Ford said, ''I used to put a cigarette between her fingers.'' Her mischievous side also surfaced after her husband complained that she was too thin. Borrowing a skeleton from a hospital, she dressed it in her hat and coat and sat it in a bedroom chair to welcome him.

 Later, when she was no longer first lady, she was criticized in some circles for having a facelift almost immediately after overcoming her addictions. She wanted, she said, a fresh new face for her new life. She later thought that some of the resentment stemmed from the fact that she could no longer be perceived as a victim -- of cancer, drugs and drink. ''It was easier to be sorry for me, to feel superior to me, and therefore to root for me,'' she said. ''We all like to cheer an underdog. But I'd stopped being an underdog; I'd gotten myself in hand.''

 Elizabeth Anne Bloomer was born on April 8, 1918, in Chicago to William S. Bloomer and the former Hortense Neahr. She always wanted to be called Elizabeth but ended up with Betty, Bet or Bets. She was the youngest child and the only girl in a family of three children. Her father was a traveling salesman in conveyor belts for factories. The family moved to Grand Rapids, Mich., when she was 2.

 The Bloomers were financially comfortable, lived in a fashionable area and spent summers at Whitefish Lake. She began dancing lessons when she was 8, and for two summers after graduation from high school she attended Bennington School of the Dance at Bennington College in Vermont. At 14, she was confirmed as an Episcopalian (her mother's religion; her father was a Christian Scientist) and began working on Saturdays, for $3, as a model for Herpolsheimer's department store.

 At 20, she was in New York, living on the fringes of Greenwich Village and attending dance classes with Martha Graham. She also joined her troupe.

 Dance was always a major interest, and Mrs. Ford said many times that she was disappointed that she had never been quite good enough to be a first-rate dancer. When she went to China with her husband in 1975, however, she enchanted the Chinese by kicking off her shoes and dancing in her stocking feet at a Beijing school.

 Her mother persuaded her to return to Grand Rapids in 1941, but not before she had modeled on Seventh Avenue and for the John Robert Powers modeling agency. Back home, she became a fashion coordinator for the store in which she had been a teenage model. In her spare time, she taught dance to underprivileged and disabled children.

 The following year, she married William C. Warren, a furniture dealer. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947, and she did not ask for alimony. When Mr. Ford became vice president and his wife's first marriage was disclosed, Mrs. Ford was asked why she had kept it a secret. She hadn't, she said: ''No one ever bothered to ask.''

 Some months after her divorce, she began dating Gerald R. Ford, a lawyer with political ambitions and a man she described as ''probably the most eligible bachelor in Grand Rapids.'' He proposed in February 1948. ''He's a very shy man and he really didn't tell me he loved me,'' she wrote. ''He just told me he'd like to marry me -- I took him up on it immediately.''

 They were married on Oct. 15, 1948, while he was running his first race for a seat in the House. The ceremony took place on a Friday so that Mr. Ford's plans to go to a Northwestern-Michigan football game the following day would not be disrupted. (He had played center for Michigan.) The groom was 35; the bride, 30. They spent their two-day honeymoon at Republican Party rallies.

 Mr. Ford won the election. ''We came to Washington for 2 years and stayed for 28,'' Mrs. Ford said. Their first son, Michael, was born in 1950 while the Fords lived in an apartment in Georgetown. By 1952, when John, known as Jack, was born, they had moved to an apartment in suburban Northern Virginia. Steven was born in 1956, a year after the Fords' split-level house in Alexandria, Va., was completed. Susan, their only daughter, came along the next year.

 ''From the outside, our life looked like a Norman Rockwell illustration,'' Mrs. Ford said at one point. Nevertheless, by 1962, she was seeing a psychiatrist twice a week because, as she put it, ''I'd lost my feeling of self-worth.''

 ''I think a lot of women go through this,'' she said. ''Their husbands have fascinating jobs, their children start to turn into independent people and the women begin to feel useless, empty.''

 Later, when she accompanied her husband on campaign trips more frequently, she acknowledged that that, too, was not all fun. At one point, she recalled, she was in an airport and ''through clenched teeth said: 'I don't want anyone to come over and talk to me. I just want to sit here all alone and finish this cigarette.' ''

 Shortly after leaving the White House, the Fords built a 15-room house bordering the 13th fairway of the Thunderbird Country Club in Rancho Mirage. The couple also acquired a second home, an elaborate ski lodge in Vail, Colo. Mrs. Ford remained active in the Betty Ford Center and in feminist causes.

 In addition to her four children, she is also survived by seven grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

2011-11-14 00:00:00,54496,"William Aramony, who built United Way of America into one of the nation's premier charities but was forced out as president and went to prison for six years for misusing funds to support a lavish lifestyle and a teenage mistress, died on Friday in Alexandria, Va., where he lived. He was 84.

 He died of bone cancer, a complication of prostate cancer, at the Alexandria home of his son Robert, who confirmed his death.

 In Mr. Aramony's 22 years as chief executive, from 1970 to 1992, United Way of America and its more than 2,100 independent affiliates became familiar to millions of Americans whose contributions, by payroll deductions and in small donations in factories, stores and offices, were funneled through local social service agencies to a host of charitable causes and needy people in their own communities.

 Creative and charismatic, Mr. Aramony turned a jumble of loose affiliates with many names and fund-raising aims into a drive with a common name and a strategy of community-based annual campaigns. His Alexandria hub raised no funds but took 1 percent of the contributions to affiliates for management services, training and marketing -- often public service appeals by the National Football League and other groups.

 During his tenure, United Way receipts rose to $3.1 billion from $787 million. His annual salary and benefits topped $460,000. Critics said his compensation and use of apartments in New York City and Coral Gables, Fla., were unseemly in a charity built on little donations from ordinary people. But Mr. Aramony insisted that he needed the perks to build bridges to the corporate leaders who promoted United Way.

 In 1992, however, he resigned when an internal investigation and news reports disclosed his expense-account living and luxury travel, including trans-Atlantic flights on the Concorde. Federal investigators began examining accusations that for years Mr. Aramony had also spent lavishly on a young Florida woman with whom he had begun an affair in 1986, shortly after her high school graduation.

 In 1994, Mr. Aramony and two associates were indicted on 71 counts of fraud, conspiracy, tax evasion and money laundering, accused of stealing $1 million from a United Way corporate spinoff. Some $80,000 was said to have been given to his lover, Lori Villasor, and more for vacation trips with her to London, New York, Egypt and Las Vegas, and for Champagne, flowers and even a fax machine for him to send love notes.

 The case was a humiliation for United Way. Charitable contributions fell, and some affiliates withheld dues for a time. But the national organization instituted reforms, cut its budget and eventually improved its image and fund-raising. Its 33 directors, a virtual Who's Who of America's corporate and labor leaders, were not charged, although they were portrayed by prosecutors as unduly respectful of Mr. Aramony.

 In Federal District Court in Alexandria in 1995, prosecutors detailed a conspiracy that used the Partnership Umbrella, a United Way subsidiary Mr. Aramony set up in 1986, to siphon money. Testimony spun a tale of romantic dalliances with a woman 42 years his junior, of cruises on the Nile, gambling in Las Vegas and weekends at an Upper East Side condo in Manhattan.

 Lawyers for Mr. Aramony and his co-defendants, Stephen J. Paulachak and Thomas J. Merlo, both United Way executives, denied the allegations but called no witnesses. Money laundering and many other charges were dropped before deliberations, but the jury found all three guilty of conspiracy, fraud and the theft of $600,000. Appeals were denied, and they went to prison.

 ''Obviously this is a personal tragedy for the individuals involved, but a self-inflicted one,'' said Keith E. Bailey, chairman of United Way at the time.

 William Aramony was born in Jewett City, Conn., on July 27, 1927, the youngest of five children of Russell and Nazley Farrah Aramony, Christian immigrants from Lebanon. He grew up in Worcester, Mass., graduated from Clark University in 1949 and earned a master's degree in social work at Boston College in 1951.

 That year, he married Bebe Ann Nojeim. They had three children, and were separated in 1988 and divorced in 1991. He married Gail Manza in 2002. Besides Ms. Manza and his son Robert, Mr. Aramony is survived by a daughter, Susan Kanelidis; a son, William; and seven grandchildren.

 Mr. Aramony was in the Army from 1951 to 1953 and became a lieutenant in the Medical Service Corps, providing psychiatric social services at a military hospital in Texas to Korean War veterans with combat stress disorders.

 In 1954, he joined the United Community Funds and Council of America, the predecessor of United Way, and over the next four years was a staff planner for the Community Chest in South Bend, Ind. Through the 1960s, he was an executive with affiliates in Indiana, South Carolina and Florida.

 When he joined the national governing body in 1970, it was like a trade association -- an outgrowth of many charities that dated to the 19th century -- with no real authority over its thousands of autonomous affiliates, which went by no fewer than 137 names and pursued thousands of charitable objectives.

 To give the organization national scope and identity, Mr. Aramony renamed it United Way of America, moved its headquarters from New York to Alexandria, and had the graphic designer Saul Bass create a United Way logo: a blue hand with an abstract human in its palm, overarched by a rainbow. He traveled to every major city to persuade the autonomous affiliates to adopt the logo, the common name and a united strategy, while keeping their own leaders and goals.

 Besides community appeals and payroll deductions, which proved to be wildly successful, his strategy depended on mass marketing. He achieved a breakthrough in 1973 by forming a partnership with the N.F.L., using players and coaches to make public service appeals at halftime gratis.

 By 1981, when Ronald Reagan became president, United Way and Mr. Aramony were recognized as prime movers in charitable giving, and Reagan named him to his Private Sector Initiative task force, which sought ways to compensate for deep cuts in federal spending on welfare and community needs.

 In his 1987 book, ''The United Way: The Next Hundred Years,'' Mr. Aramony predicted phenomenal growth for his organization. But the rosy forecasts dimmed as disclosures by The Washington Post and Regardie's magazine prompted investigations that led to his resignation and conviction.

 While in prison, Mr. Aramony sued United Way, claiming $4.2 million in pension benefits and deferred compensation. United Way countersued, and after a series of battles a federal court ruled that he was entitled to some benefits. But because he had to repay the money he stole, and cover taxes and lawyers' fees, he received only $7,781.

 He was released from federal prison in September 2001.

 Mr. Aramony had spent much of the last decade working on a project of his own in the Middle East to promote exchange visits, fellowship gatherings and mediation services for Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities.","William Aramony, who built United Way of America into one of the nation's premier charities but was forced out as president and went to prison for six years for misusing funds to support a lavish lifestyle and a teenage mistress, died on Friday in Alexandria, Va., where he lived.","The New York Times                              November 14, 2011 Monday                               Correction Appended                               Late Edition - Final  William Aramony, United Way Leader Who Was Jailed for Fraud, Dies at 84"
2012-07-31 00:00:00,12406,"James D. Watkins, a Navy admiral during the cold war who was later enlisted in battles far from the sea and submarines he knew best, as energy secretary under the first President George Bush and as the head of a presidential commission on AIDS, died on Thursday at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 85.

 His death was confirmed by his wife, Janet McDonough Watkins.

 James Watkins, a graduate of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, served on surface ships in the Korean War and submarines in the Vietnam War. He rose to commander of the Pacific Fleet, chief of naval personnel and vice chief of naval operations before President Ronald Reagan appointed him chief of naval operations in 1982. He served in that role for four years, when the Navy was engaged in operations in Grenada, Lebanon and the Persian Gulf, and the United States was navigating a shifting relationship with the Soviet Union.

 After Admiral Watkins retired in 1986, Mr. Reagan appointed him to lead the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic. It was during the height of the AIDS crisis, and Admiral Watkins was the first to question whether he was the best person for the job.

 ''He did tell President Reagan that he knew nothing about AIDS, but Reagan said, 'You're just the man I want,' '' Mrs. Watkins recalled. ''You don't say no to presidents, obviously.''

 Some advocates for AIDS patients criticized the appointment, saying it reflected a conservative White House's lack of commitment to the issue. But Admiral Watkins, a Republican and a practicing Roman Catholic, proved to be independent-minded. He toured clinics and hospitals and was deeply affected by the victims he encountered, he said, particularly children.

 In June 1988, the commission, which became known as the Watkins Commission, released a report calling for more research and treatment and federal legislation banning discrimination against people with AIDS. The commission narrowly approved the report, by a 7-to-6 vote. Vice President George Bush, who was running for president that year, embraced its findings, citing Admiral Watkins's arguments against discrimination. President Reagan, in his final six months in office, ultimately adopted protections that were weaker than those proposed.

 As Mr. Bush's energy secretary, Mr. Watkins angered environmentalists by pushing to expand domestic oil production, including production off the coast of California, after oil markets became volatile during the Persian Gulf crisis, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. But he also promised greater conservation efforts, noting that the Energy Department had begun a marketing campaign to encourage people to keep their tires properly inflated to get the best gas mileage.

 In 2001, Admiral Watkins became chairman of the Commission on Ocean Policy, which was created by President George W. Bush. It was a role Admiral Watkins relished. Under his leadership, the commission called for better controls over coastal pollution and overfishing and for greater scientific input in regulatory policies. But he was frustrated that Congress had not yet ratified the international Law of the Sea treaty, particularly in light of expanding commercial interest in the Arctic.

 The treaty, among other things, expands access to deep-sea oil and natural gas drilling while requiring parties to adopt antipollution regulations. Though it has been supported by many business and environmental interests and adopted by most countries, it has failed to win the 67 votes needed for Senate ratification. Republicans, as recently as July, have opposed it as undermining American sovereignty. ''We need to be in the game, at the table, talking about fisheries management, mineral extraction, freedom of navigation,'' Admiral Watkins said in 2005.

 Mrs. Watkins said the health of the oceans was her husband's greatest passion.

 ''His dearest wish before he died was to see the Law of the Sea legislation passed,'' she said.

 James David Watkins was born in Alhambra, Calif., on March 7, 1927, and raised in Pasadena, the sixth of seven children. His father, Edward, was a vintner until Prohibition forced him to shut down. Edward Watkins later worked for Southern California Edison. Mr. Watkins's mother, Louise Ward, ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate from California.

 Admiral Watkins's first wife, the former Sheila Jo McKinney, died in 1996. Besides his wife, survivors include three daughters, Catherine Coopersmith, Laura Jo Kauffmann and Susan Watkins; three sons, Charles, Msgr. James Jr. and Edward; four stepchildren, Christopher, Sean, Robert and Siobhan McDonough; a brother, John; 14 grandchildren; and 3 great-grandchildren.

 Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who has been involved with AIDS research since the syndrome was first labeled in 1981 and now heads infectious-disease programs at the National Institutes of Health, often briefed the AIDS commission and Admiral Watkins. Dr. Fauci's wife, a nurse who worked with AIDS at the time, was on the commission staff.

 ''She would come home at night saying this is an amazing guy,'' Dr. Fauci recalled. ''He really breaks the stereotype people have of a regimented military officer. He is very compassionate.''","James D.

2012-07-14 00:00:00,12344,"Maria Cole, a jazz singer who performed with Count Basie and Duke Ellington in the 1940s and who was married to Nat King Cole for 17 years until his death in 1965, died on Tuesday in Boca Raton, Fla. She was 89.

 The cause was stomach cancer, her daughter Timolin Cole Augustus said. Mrs. Cole was also the mother of the Grammy-winning singer Natalie Cole.

 Mrs. Cole grew up in genteel circumstances in North Carolina, then left college in Boston to pursue a jazz career, moving to New York and joining Benny Carter's band. She performed with Count Basie and Fletcher Henderson before Ellington heard a recording of her throaty, resonant voice in the mid-1940s and hired her as a vocalist for his band, Duke Ellington's Orchestra. In 1946 she began appearing solo at Club Zanzibar in Harlem as an opening act for the Mills Brothers.

 One night the Nat King Cole Trio had substituted for the Mills Brothers, and as Mr. Cole stood backstage and glimpsed her as she sang, he was smitten. He divorced his first wife, Nadine, and they were married in 1948 by Adam Clayton Powell Jr., the congressman, at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.

 ''Nat wanted to improve himself,'' Mrs. Cole told The Boston Globe in 1989. ''I wanted to help him improve. What he needed, I had. What I needed, he had. That's why our marriage worked.''

 Mrs. Cole paused her career to raise their five children and travel with her husband as his career flourished. His string of hits included ''Unforgettable,'' ''Candy'' and ''Mona Lisa,'' and he became the first black host of a national variety show on television, ''The Nat King Cole Show,'' which ran from 1956-57. On tour they risked and sometimes encountered racial violence in the Jim Crow South; Mr. Cole was attacked onstage in Alabama in 1956.

 Before Mr. Cole died of lung cancer, at 45, Mrs. Cole had returned to singing, recording songs with her husband with Capitol Records, according to her family. Her best-known solo album, ''Love Is a Special Feeling,'' was released in 1966.

 Marie Frances Hawkins was born in Boston on Aug. 1, 1922. Her father, Mingo Hawkins, was a postal worker; her mother, Caro Saunders, died in childbirth when Ms. Hawkins was 2. Ms. Hawkins and her sister Charlotte were sent to North Carolina to live with their aunt, Dr. Charlotte Hawkins Brown, who founded the Palmer Memorial Institute, a prestigious black preparatory school near Greensboro. She graduated from the institute in 1938.

 Ms. Hawkins returned to Boston to attend a clerical college but began working with a jazz orchestra by night and soon dropped out to pursue her love of music in New York, much to the chagrin of her family, who thought jazz an inappropriate vocation for a proper young lady.

 In 1943 she married Spurgeon Ellington (no relation to Duke Ellington), a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black unit of the Army Air Corps in World War II. He died during a training flight.

 After Mr. Cole's death, Mrs. Cole continued to record and perform, once on ''The Ed Sullivan Show.'' She also was the host of a talk show in Chicago and Los Angeles. A subsequent marriage ended in divorce.

 In addition to her daughters Timolin and Natalie, and her sister Charlotte, Mrs. Cole is survived by another daughter, Casey Cole Hooker; and six grandchildren.","Maria Cole, a jazz singer who performed with Count Basie and Duke Ellington in the 1940s and who was married to Nat King Cole for 17 years until his death in 1965, died on Tuesday in Boca Raton, Fla.

2012-03-24 00:00:00,31341,"MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a cantankerous former warlord who led Somalia's beleaguered transitional government as president from 2004 to 2008 and was forced to resign as the country sank deeper into chaos, died on Friday in Abu Dhabi. He was 77. The cause was complications of pneumonia, his family said. Mr. Yusuf, who was granted asylum in Yemen after he stepped down, had gone to Abu Dhabi for treatment, government officials said. He had undergone a liver transplant in 1996.

 Mr. Yusuf was the first president of the Transitional Federal Government, which was founded in 2004 with the assistance of the United Nations. But he had little success in bringing the country's warring factions together and was widely seen as an obstacle to peace because of his refusal to deal with Islamist rebels and his clannish tendencies.

 Since 1991, the 13 previous attempts at forming a functioning central government had failed amid clan-driven violence and the resistance of gun runners and other war profiteers. When Mr. Yusuf resigned, the government controlled only a few city blocks in a country nearly the size of Texas, with Islamist insurgents in charge of much of the rest.

 The 2009 election of Mr. Yusuf's successor, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, a moderate Islamist cleric, was greeted with joyful demonstrations in Mogadishu. Many viewed it as a first step on a path out of the violence that has plagued Somalia.

 Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed was born Dec. 15, 1934, in Barta and grew up in nearby Galkacyo. He is survived by his wife, Hawa Abdi Samatar, and four children.

 A career soldier who was Somalia's military attache to the former Soviet Union in the 1960s, Mr. Yusuf was jailed for six years for refusing to take part in the 1969 coup that put Mohammed Siad Barre in power.

 Three years after his release in 1975, Mr. Yusuf tried to overthrow Mr. Barre but failed and fled to Kenya, where he recruited fighters for his guerrilla movement. He was backed by Ethiopia's socialist government but later had a falling out with it over Ethiopian claims to Somali territory. The Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam imprisoned him in 1985, and he was not released until the regime fell in 1991.

 He spent much of the 1990s in his native Puntland, where he sought semiautonomous status to save the region from the chaos engulfing the rest of the nation. Aides described his style as ruthless, and many opponents were jailed or killed. There were also sporadic clashes over territory with the neighboring region of Somaliland, and he was deposed for a year over his attempts to increase his term of office in 2001.

 Mr. Yusuf regained control of Puntland in 2002 with Ethiopian help, forging a new alliance with the new government there.

 In 2004, Mr. Yusuf was elected president of Somalia by the National Assembly, having systematically undermined several attempts by others to form a government. At the time, he told lawmakers, ''Somalia is a failed state and we have nothing,'' and he urged the international community to help disarm the militias. His inauguration was held in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi because of security concerns.

 In 2006, he survived a suicide car bombing that killed his brother and several bodyguards. It was one of several assassination attempts.

 When an Islamic alliance took control of Mogadishu, also in 2006, Mr. Yusuf invited Ethiopian troops into the country, with American backing. The Ethiopians routed the Islamist forces, but the presence of soldiers from a Christian nation in a mainly Muslim country made the government unpopular. It also encouraged Ethiopia's enemy Eritrea to offer the Islamists assistance, making Somalia a proxy war zone. The Islamists quickly began an Iraq-style insurgency.

 While some Somali leaders favored sharing power with moderate Islamist insurgents, Mr. Yusuf refused, calling the Islamists terrorists. He tried to block a measure that would have brought moderate Islamists into the government.

 ''Yusuf has gone from being seen as the solution to being seen as the problem,'' a senior Western diplomat in Kenya told The New York Times in 2008.

 Under pressure from foreign governments and internal foes, and facing the threat of a complete withdrawal by the Ethiopian forces that had propped up his administration, Mr. Yusuf decided to resign in December 2008.","Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a cantankerous former warlord who led Somalia's beleaguered transitional government as president from 2004 to 2008 and was forced to resign as the country sank deeper into chaos, died on Friday in Abu Dhabi.","The New York Times                              March 24, 2012 Saturday                               Late Edition - Final  Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, 77, Former Somali Strongman"

 The Saudi Press Agency announced his death but gave no other details.

 Prince Mohammed was not in line for the Saudi throne but wielded influence as part of a council of royal family members that helps select the heirs to rule the country.

 He served as defense minister in the early 1960s and managed to remain an important political figure after his father, King Saud, was forced from the throne in 1964. He was also governor of Al Bahah Province in southwestern Saudi Arabia from 1986 to 2010.

2012-06-27 00:00:00,12295,"Michael J. Dontzin, who as counsel to Mayor John V. Lindsay in the early 1970s helped deal with uprisings in New York City's jails and who later served as a State Supreme Court justice, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.

 The cause was cancer, his wife, Janet Sarno, said.

 Mr. Dontzin was counsel to Mayor Lindsay from 1970 to 1973, serving in particular as the liaison to the Police Department, the court system and the Department of Correction. He was assistant counsel during the mayor's first term.

 When prisoners at the Manhattan House of Detention seized five guards and held them hostage for eight hours on Aug. 10, 1970, Mr. Dontzin negotiated the guards' release. As uprisings erupted at other city jails over the next few months, Mr. Dontzin found himself at the forefront of a serious crisis during Mr. Lindsay's tenure. The inmates were protesting crowded, unsanitary conditions and brutality by guards.

 Advocating improved conditions, Mr. Dontzin said at the time: ''The public has never made the problems of prisons a priority. If the prisons didn't blow up, they would never give a damn.''

 A protege of Alex Rose, a founder of New York's Liberal Party, Mr. Dontzin was the party's executive director in the Bronx when Mr. Lindsay brought him into his administration. The party was founded in 1944, and Mr. Rose used to describe its agenda as keeping Republicans liberal and Democrats honest. Mr. Lindsay ran on the Liberal and Republican lines in his first mayoral election, and on the Liberal and Independent lines in his second, after losing the Republican primary.

 ''This was a time when the party had enormous significance, in both of Lindsay's elections,'' Jay L. Kriegel, Mayor Lindsay's chief of staff, said on Monday. Mr. Rose wanted Mr. Dontzin in City Hall, he said, adding: ''He was the liaison. They wanted someone around knowing what was going on, and he was their guy.''

 Days before leaving office in 1973, Mr. Lindsay appointed Mr. Dontzin to a Criminal Court judgeship. He was elected to the State Supreme Court two years later.

 In one of his most significant cases, Justice Dontzin ruled in 1982 that Consolidated Edison's ''gross negligence'' was responsible for the 1977 blackout that crippled New York City for 25 hours and led to widespread rioting and looting. In 1979, he ruled that the city's procedure for placing foster children in out-of-state institutions was unconstitutional because it denied their parents the right to appeal such placements.

 Michael Joseph Dontzin was born in Bridgeport, Conn., on Feb. 24, 1923, to Joseph and Miriam Dontzin, immigrants from Russia. His father worked in a laundry. After serving in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II, Mr. Dontzin graduated from New York University in 1948 and two years later earned his law degree there. Moving to the Bronx, he joined the Liberal Party and for nine years was law secretary to a State Supreme Court justice.

 Justice Dontzin retired from the bench in 1992.

 Besides Ms. Sarno, his wife of 35 years, Mr. Dontzin is survived by his son, Matthew; his daughter, Lisa Dontzin; and two grandchildren.

 The cause was complications from surgery related to diabetes, her lawyer, Vito. A. Palmieri, said.

 Ms. Cooper is credited with turning around a dilapidated 1,255-acre park that was the site of the World's Fair in 1939 and 1964. Its most prominent landmark is the Unisphere, a giant steel globe erected for the 1964 fair. During Ms. Cooper's 17-year tenure, the park added amenities, including an ice rink and aquatics center that cost $66.3 million.

 Ms. Cooper, a Republican, ran unsuccessfully for the State Senate in 1978 and for Queens borough president in 1986.

 She was indicted on the theft charges last spring. Prosecutors said she had stolen the money from Unisphere Inc., a nonprofit organization that was supposed to provide support for the park. She faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.

 Prosecutors said the theft was discovered by the organization's accountant, Phil Ragusa, who is also the chairman of the Queens County Republican Party. Ms. Cooper, who had an annual salary of $101,507, resigned from her park position shortly afterward.

 She is survived by a son, Peter; a daughter, Ilene Balsamo; and several grandchildren.

 ''We were trying to work something out with the district attorney's office, but at this point that's going to be moot,'' Mr. Palmieri said.

 ''If it wasn't for her health, she would have fought vehemently against this,'' he added.

2013-03-12 00:00:00,3640,"''If I were to sum up my life, everything has been about love,'' Princess Lilian of Sweden once said.

 In what Swedes consider a Cinderella story, Lilian Craig, who died on Sunday at 97, lived for a third of a century as the lover of Sweden's Prince Bertil, unable to marry because there was a chance he could become king, and Swedish kings were forbidden to wed commoners. Pretty much the whole country knew about their relationship, but they were still barred from appearing in public together.

 Three years after King Gustaf VI died, in 1973 -- to be succeeded by his grandson Carl Gustaf -- Prince Bertil, a son of the older king, finally married Ms. Craig. He was 64 and she was 61, and both called it the happiest day of their lives. Ms. Craig became a princess and duchess with the nuptials.

 ''I was nervous as a kitten,'' Ms. Craig told The Boston Globe in 1985. ''I had butterflies in my tummy. When we exchanged vows, I was afraid I wouldn't even remember my husband's name.''

 The wedding signaled the formal end of an already bygone era. Prince Bertil had agreed to refrain from marrying a commoner because of fears it could jeopardize the royal line: he was next in line to the throne until Carl Gustaf, his nephew -- and now the king -- came of age. Today, many members of European royalty, including Sweden's, routinely and without penalty marry commoners, and female prospects have the same succession rights as male. Carl Gustaf himself married a commoner.

 Princess Lilian paid a price for her loyalty, including whispers early on about living in sin. She said she regretted not having children. ''But now the queen's children are like my children,'' she told The Globe. ''It makes up. Well, not quite.''

 As for not being allowed to be seen in public for many years, she said: ''Sometimes I felt it wasn't nice. But it was nice that we were together, anyway.''

 Her death, in Stockholm, was announced by the royal palace.

 Lillian May Davies was born in Swansea, Wales, on Aug. 30, 1915, and left school at 14 to seek work as a maid in London. She ended up working as a fashion model, dancer and singer, and marrying Ivan Craig, an actor. She dropped one of the L's from her first name, she said, because she thought it seemed more fashionable that way. During World War II, while Mr. Craig served in the British Army in Africa, Ms. Craig worked at a factory making radios for the Royal Navy and at a hospital for wounded soldiers.

 There are several versions of how she met Prince Bertil, in 1943, when he was naval attach in the Swedish Embassy: at a party held to celebrate her 28th birthday, at a nightclub, in the London subway. One story has the prince gallantly rescuing her from a drunken sailor.

 In any case, she wrote in her memoir, ''My Life With Prince Bertil'' (2000), she was captivated: ''He was so handsome, my prince. Especially in uniform. So charming and thoughtful. And so funny.''

 During their wartime separation, her husband had also developed another romantic tie. They divorced amicably.

 Two of Prince Bertil's brothers had already disqualified themselves from the line of succession by marrying commoners, becoming the first members of the Swedish royal family to do so in 400 years. Their grandfather Gustaf V, who remained king until 1950, had blocked a marriage between Prince Bertil and the daughter of a Swedish Army captain in 1934, according to The Associated Press. Prince Bertil was soon publicly linked to Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, who later became the country's queen, but that incipient relationship also fell through.

 In 1947, Prince Bertil's eldest brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf, the heir to the throne, died in a plane crash. Gustaf Adolf's son, Carl Gustaf, was less than a year old, and if the king had died before the child was old enough to assume the throne, Prince Bertil might have had to serve as a regent, or acting monarch.

 Both Prince Bertil's grandfather (who died in 1950) and father refused to allow him to marry a commoner. So he and Ms. Craig lived together in France until 1957, when they moved to Sweden to live discreetly. Her first public appearance with him was in 1972, at the 90th-birthday celebration of King Gustav VI, who had developed a personal liking for her.

 Once wed and royal, Princess Lilian, who left no immediate survivors, participated in Nobel Prize events in Stockholm. After Prince Bertil died in 1997, she helped lead sports organizations in which he had been active.

 She said laughter was the key to her longevity, and also to her great romance.

 ''Oh, how we laughed together!'' she said.","''If I were to sum up my life, everything has been about love,'' Princess Lilian of Sweden once said.","The New York Times                               March 12, 2013 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Lilian Craig, 97, Beloved Of Prince Who Could Be King"

 His death, at Calvary Hospital, resulted from complications of lung cancer, a friend, William O'Shaughnessey, said. Mr. O'Rourke had also been treated for Parkinson's disease. He lived in Yorktown, N.Y.

 Ruddy-faced and silver-haired, Mr. O'Rourke brought a witty, bantering manner to his performance in government as well as to the campaign trail when he agreed to take on the all-but-hopeless task of unseating Governor Cuomo. He laughed off its seeming futility, saying, ''They told Goliath: 'Don't worry. It's only a kid out there.' ''

 When Mr. Cuomo refused to debate him, Mr. O'Rourke brought along a cardboard cutout of the governor to his campaign appearances and debated the effigy. When the cutout failed to draw Mr. Cuomo out, Mr. O'Rourke confronted him on a radio call-in show in Albany. Mr. O'Rourke was the first caller, and a five-minute exchange followed in which he rebuked Mr. Cuomo as arrogant.

 The candidates eventually did debate once. Mr. Cuomo won close to two-thirds of the vote on Election Day.

 Mr. O'Rourke had the second-longest tenure of any Westchester county executive. (Edwin G. Michaelian had the longest, from 1958 to 1973.) While in office, from 1983 to 1997, he built a new county jail, a recycling plant and a new airport terminal, reopened Rye Playland as a county amusement park, required that welfare recipients go to work to earn their benefits, and presided over the building of permanent shelters for the homeless.

 He was able to boast that he had preserved Westchester's AAA bond rating -- for a time the only such rating in the state -- and for many years kept taxes stable, though his critics said he depended on budgetary tricks.

 Groomed in the ward politics of Yonkers, he seemed to have a blind spot for the finer points of government ethics. In 1993, responding to revelations in Westchester newspapers, he acknowledged that he had sought a job for his son-in-law and an admission interview for his daughter at a medical college under contract with the county. He recommended his live-in companion at the time -- Flora Lowe, whom he married -- for a job with the county medical insurer, and he looked the other way when his daughter was hired by the county's malpractice law firm.

 ''These are, as far as I'm concerned, the everyday things and courtesies that are done in life,'' he said at an emotional news conference.

 A grand jury and a district attorney's investigation ultimately cleared him of any conflicts of interest, and he won re-election in 1993. In 1997, he announced that he would not seek another term.

 Andrew Patrick O'Rourke was born in Plainfield, N.J., on Oct. 26, 1933, the youngest of five children. His father, a doctor, died of tuberculosis when Mr. O'Rourke was not yet 2, and eight years later, his mother went blind. The family had to subsist on welfare, a point that Mr. O'Rourke often mentioned in defending the county's welfare program, even as he required recipients to work for their benefits.

 ''I knew it from the inside out, and it's a terrible place to be,'' he said. But he added that too many children in families on welfare assume that ''money came in a mailbox,'' that ''there was no connection to work.''

 After the family moved to the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan, in the West 40s, Mr. O'Rourke delivered fish and worked as an usher in the Paramount Theater on Times Square. For a time, he was a child actor, appearing briefly on Broadway and regularly as a guest on a coast-to-coast radio children's quiz show.

 Mr. O'Rourke graduated from Fordham University, trained as an Air Force bombardier and navigator, received a law degree from Fordham and went into private law practice in Yonkers. Entering Yonkers politics, he served on the City Council and the county's Board of Legislators. When Alfred B. DelBello, the Democratic county executive, was elected lieutenant governor in 1982, the Legislature selected Mr. O'Rourke to fill the rest of Mr. DelBello's term.

 Supporters regarded him as innovative in letting private companies assume historically public functions. He turned the feeding of county prisoners over to private companies, for example, and enrolled Medicaid recipients in managed care.

 Mr. O'Rourke was also bedeviled by scandals. In one, he awarded contracts for the county hospital and airport parking garages to the husband of the county's district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro, a Republican, though his conduct was never found to be illegal.

 Mr. O'Rourke also pursued a side vocation writing adventure fiction, including the novels ''The Red Banner Mutiny,'' based on a 1975 insurrection aboard a Soviet destroyer, and ''Hawkwood,'' about a soldier of fortune.

 He wound down his career as the senior State Supreme Court justice for Putnam County.

 Mr. O'Rourke's marriage to the former Alice T. McKenna, who died in 2011, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Ms. Lowe; three children from his first marriage, Alice, Aileen and Andrew Jr.; and six grandchildren.

 His friend Mr. O'Shaughnessey said that former Governor Cuomo phoned Mr. O'Rourke at the hospital about 10 days ago and that the two had a pleasant 20-minute conversation.","Andrew P.

2013-03-19 00:00:00,3656,"Booth Gardner, a two-term governor of Washington whose diagnosis with Parkinson's disease after he left office helped motivate him to lead a successful voter initiative to allow physician-assisted suicide, died on Friday at his home in Tacoma. He was 76.

 The cause was complications of Parkinson's, said Ron Dotzauer, a family spokesman.

 Mr. Gardner's condition did not qualify him to use the Washington Death With Dignity Act, which the state's voters approved in 2008. The law, modeled on one passed earlier in Oregon, allows terminally ill adults to obtain a doctor's prescription for a lethal dose of medication. Mr. Gardner knew that Parkinson's was not considered terminal under the law.

 ''I wish we could do a more liberal law, but we're going to pattern it after the Oregon law because it passed,'' he said during the 2008 campaign. ''We're not going to go farther than that now.''

 ''My goal,'' he said then, ''is to lessen the pain of dying.''

 The measure passed with 58 percent of the vote.

 Barbara Coombs Lee, the president of Compassion and Choices, an advocacy group that helped lead the campaign in Washington State, recalled meeting Mr. Gardner at the group's Seattle office in 2006.

 ''Booth had not yet received the brain procedures that would later reverse some of his Parkinson's symptoms and it was sometimes difficult to understand his speech,'' Ms. Lee wrote in a blog post on Monday. ''Nevertheless, he projected unwavering confidence and abiding good nature. He looked at us, the supposed 'experts' seated around the table. Then he jabbed his thumb back over his shoulder with absolute authority, and said, 'We're going to have a campaign, and I want you all to get in line behind me.' So we did.''

 Mr. Gardner, a Democrat who was governor from 1985 to 1993, knew how to campaign. He was a little-known county executive when he first ran for governor in 1984 (his counterintuitive slogan: ''Booth Who?''), but he went on to become one of his state's most popular politicians.

 In the late 1980s, he signed into law a health care program that provided state medical insurance for the working poor. He helped develop land-use and growth-management policies that made Washington an early environmental leader.

 He steered hundreds of millions of dollars of increased spending toward state universities, increased standardized testing in public education and improved legal protections for gay people.

 Mr. Gardner served when the Northwest was prospering amid the rise of companies like Microsoft and Starbucks and stepping into the pop culture spotlight as the birthplace of grunge rock.

 He was unafraid to seek tax increases, but the Legislature did not always comply, and some critics accused him of backing down too quickly. A 2010 biography suggested his work in office should earn about a B.

 ''This will sound strange,'' Mr. Gardner told John C. Hughes, the author of the biography, ''Booth Who?'' ''But I didn't think it was worth the price to go for an A.''

 Mr. Gardner, Mr. Hughes wrote, was ''alluding to the fact that after six years he was burned out from 16-hour days. In retrospect, he realizes he was also showing the early symptoms of Parkinson's.''

 William Booth Gardner was born on Aug. 21, 1936, in Tacoma. His ancestors made their way to Washington well before it became a state in 1889 and became successful and socially prominent. His father, Bryson, was a car salesman. Mr. Gardner's parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother, Evelyn Booth Gardner, married Norton Clapp, a wealthy executive with Weyerhaeuser, the timber company. His mother and his sister, his only sibling, died in a plane crash when he was 14.

 Mr. Gardner enrolled at the University of Washington in Seattle in 1954. He joined a fraternity, Phi Delta Theta, but he was uncomfortable there and soon moved in with an aunt and uncle.

 His aunt, frustrated that he was not more engaged with extracurricular activities, encouraged him to get a job working with the city parks department. That move would prove crucial to his political development, exposing Mr. Gardner to the needs of poor and disabled children.

 He often worked in the city's mostly black Central District and at one point coached a football team there that included a skinny young boy who liked to played air guitar on a broomstick. His name was Jimi Hendrix. After graduating, Mr. Gardner received a master's in business administration from Harvard. He worked briefly at Harvard and in higher education in Washington State before joining one of his stepfather's firms.

 He served on several corporate boards, including Weyerhaeuser's, and was in the State Senate before being elected county executive of Pierce County, which includes Tacoma, in 1980.

 In the Democratic primary for governor in 1984, Mr. Gardner defeated Jim McDermott, a more liberal Democrat, who was elected to Congress four years later and continues to serve.

 In the general election he unseated the Republican incumbent, John Spellman. He was easily elected to a second term in 1988 but chose not to seek a third. He later served as a trade ambassador under President Bill Clinton.

 Survivors include a son, Doug; a daughter, Gail Gant; and eight grandchildren. His two marriages ended in divorce.

 Mr. Gardner learned he had Parkinson's in 1994. His eventual role in the Death With Dignity campaign shed light on complex end-of-life issues as well as on his own complex family relationships. Doug Gardner, who often had a distant relationship with his father, opposed the initiative on religious grounds.","Booth Gardner, a two-term governor of Washington whose diagnosis with Parkinson's disease after he left office helped motivate him to lead a successful voter initiative to allow physician-assisted suicide, died on Friday at his home in Tacoma.","The New York Times                               March 19, 2013 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Booth Gardner Dies at 76; Ex-Washington Governor"
2013-05-24 00:00:00,47452,"William Miles, a self-taught filmmaker whose documentaries revealed untold stories of black America, including those of its heroic black soldiers and of life in its signature neighborhood, Harlem, where he himself grew up, died on May 12 in Queens. He was 82.

 The cause was uncertain, but Mr. Miles had myriad health problems, including Parkinson's disease and dementia, said his wife of 61 years, Gloria.

 Mr. Miles was part historical sleuth, part preservationist, part bard. His films, which combined archival footage, still photographs and fresh interviews, were triumphs of curiosity and persistence in unearthing lost material about forgotten subjects.

 His first important film, ''Men of Bronze'' (1977), was about the 369th Infantry Regiment, an all-black combat unit that the Army shipped overseas during World War I but, because of segregationist policies, fought under the flag of France. Serving with great distinction, the unit spent more time in the front-line trenches than any other American unit. Collectively, it was awarded the Croix de Guerre and came to be known as the Harlem Hellfighters and also the Black Rattlers.

 The 369th began as the 15th New York National Guard Infantry Regiment, and decades later, after Mr. Miles had himself joined a National Guard unit in Harlem, he stumbled on a dusty storage room containing flags, helmets photographs and other relics from the 369th.

 He subsequently found well-preserved film footage of the regiment at the National Archives, and he tracked down living members of the unit using a technique he often employed to generate information about the past: He walked the streets of Harlem, stopping where groups of elderly residents gathered to talk and started asking questions.

 The film, which was shown on public television, depicted the black soldiers as fiercely patriotic and courageous while offering an oddly good-natured -- and moving -- critique of American racism.

 Mr. Miles's best-known work was ''I Remember Harlem,'' a four-hour historical portrait of the neighborhood that had its premiere on public television over four consecutive nights in 1981.

 ''I was walking around Harlem, where I grew up, and noticed how many of the old theaters and familiar buildings were missing,'' Mr. Miles said in an interview in The New York Times, talking about his inspiration for the film. ''I went back to my old elementary school, and on the next corner there was another man standing and looking at the building, too.''

 The man, he realized, was an old classmate.

 ''He said to me, 'I remember Harlem,' and I thought: I remember Harlem, you remember Harlem, a lot of people remember Harlem.''

 Born in Harlem on April 18, 1931, Mr. Miles grew up on West 126th Street, behind the Apollo Theater, where, as a teenager, he occasionally ran the film projector. He graduated from Benjamin Franklin High School and for a while attended City College.

 As a young man, he worked downtown as a shipping clerk for a distributor of educational films and then at Killiam Shows, a company that restored silent films; there, Mr. Miles learned mechanical skills like repairing film and clipping segments for use in commercials. During this time he met Richard Adams, who also worked at Killiam, and who became a cameraman and film editor for several of Mr. Miles's films, including ''Men of Bronze.''

 ''Bill had collaborators of all kinds,'' Mr. Adams wrote in an e-mail on Thursday, ''but only he had the vision and the persistence, and a genius for spotting archival images.''

 One of Mr. Miles's films, ''Liberators'' (1992), about black army units that helped to free Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, was partly inspired by a letter he spotted in The Times from Benjamin Bender, a Jewish survivor of Buchenwald. ''The recollections are still vivid -- '' Mr. Bender wrote of the day of liberation, April 11, 1945, ''black soldiers of the Third Army, tall and strong, crying like babies, carrying the emaciated bodies of the liberated prisoners.''

 The film, produced and directed by Mr. Miles and Nina Rosenblum, was nominated for an Academy Award, but its accuracy was subsequently questioned. Its overall point of the film -- that blacks who fought racism at home to be allowed to serve their country, then witnessed the discriminatory horrors of the Holocaust -- was not in dispute, but critics said that the film went awry in giving credit to a particular unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, part of Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army, for the liberation of Dachau and Buchenwald. (The 761st was present at the liberation of the Gunskirchen camp in Austria.) Public television stations ceased showing the film.

 In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Rosenblum said they had discovered, too late, that one of the interviewees in the film had lied about being a liberator, but she defended the film as essentially accurate, saying that Army records were inconclusive and that Mr. Miles was a scrupulous documentarian who was shattered by the controversy. ''It was the only film he ever made that had its veracity questioned,'' Ms. Rosenblum said. ''And I can tell you he tried everything to make the research complete. He was putting black history on the map in a way it hadn't been, and this was such a terrible blow. We still feel like the film, except for one guy, is valid. If the Army records are so good, tell me: Who liberated Benjamin Bender at Buchenwald?''

 Mr. Miles married the former Gloria Darlington in 1952, after having known her since they were classmates in elementary school. His other survivors include two daughters, Brenda Moore and Deborah Jones, and three grandchildren.

 Last fall, the veteran Democratic Congressman Charles B. Rangel, whose district includes Harlem, entered a testimonial to Mr. Miles in the Congressional Record. Speaking on the House floor, Mr. Rangel gave a summary of Mr. Miles's work, which includes films about black athletes, black astronauts, black cowboys, and the writer James Baldwin.

 ''Join me in a very special congressional salute to Harlem's historian and black filmmaker, William 'Bill' Miles,'' Mr. Rangel said, ''a titan of a man who has documented the history and contributions of African-Americans and the black American experience with film, camera and a lens.''

2014-03-04 00:00:00,29426,"Ralph M. Bahna, who is credited with creating one of the first luxury business-class services on a major airline and later became chairman of Priceline.com, died on Feb. 24 in Manhattan. He was 71.

 Jay S. Walker, the founder of Priceline.com, said the cause was heart failure. Mr. Bahna lived in Stamford, Conn.

 Mr. Bahna, a former college wrestler, was a transformational figure in the travel industry. He started his career at TWA, an ailing airline at the time, after graduating from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1966.

 One of his first steps was to create ''Ambassador Class,'' priced between first class and coach class but offering many of the luxuries that came with first class. The new class was widely considered a masterstroke that helped revive the fortunes of TWA and was copied throughout the industry, becoming a profit engine for airlines.

 ''He was a marketing genius,'' said Mr. Walker, who described him as a modest executive who eschewed public attention.

 At only 30 years old, Mr. Bahna became president of the American unit of Cunard Line Ltd., the British company that operates the cruise ship Queen Elizabeth 2. When he took the post, Cunard was in decline, facing increasing competition from the airline industry. Bucking industry conventions, he began marketing the QE2 as a luxury vacation, rather than simply as a way to travel across the Atlantic, and teamed with British Airways to provide flights back to the United States on the Concorde.

 Cunard became the largest buyer of Concorde seats, Mr. Walker said, and was such an important customer that British Airways regularly held flights for Mr. Bahna if he was running late. Mr. Bahna's reimagining of the QE2 worked: Cunard's business quadrupled under his leadership. In 1980 he was named chief executive and chairman of the entire company; three years later, he oversaw Cunard's acquisition of Norwegian American Cruises.

 In the early 1990s, Mr. Bahna developed a new business called Club Quarters, an international chain of hotels for business travelers in prominent areas of major cities, like Rockefeller Center in New York.

 Perhaps Mr. Bahna's greatest success was as an early investor and later chairman of Priceline.com, a website that allows customers to ''name your own price'' for hotels and air reservations and that was made famous, in part, by its longtime spokesman, William Shatner. While Mr. Bahna was chairman, the company's stock price rose over 5,000 percent.

 Mr. Bahna was born on Aug. 23, 1942, in Grand Rapids, Mich. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1964.

 In 1966 he married Dorothy Ballard. She survives him, as do his daughters, Deborah Chrabolowski and Laura Lovejoy; his son, Adam; his sister, Joanne Deeb; and eight grandchildren.","Ralph M.

2014-03-22 00:00:00,29492,"Murray L. Weidenbaum, who as President Ronald Reagan's first chief economic adviser elevated government regulation of business to the forefront of public policy debate, but resigned unhappy about the administration's budget-making, died on Thursday in St. Louis. He was 87.

 His son, Jim, confirmed the death.

 Mr. Weidenbaum, a Bronx-born economist, was fond of saying, ''Don't just stand there, undo something.'' And he did, beginning in 1981, when the newly inaugurated Mr. Reagan appointed him chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

 Reducing the size of government and lightening its regulatory hold on the private sector -- including the banking, broadcasting and the food and drug industries -- became a large theme of the Reagan presidency, which began with inflation still running in double digits and the economy heading into recession.

 Deregulation, the White House believed, would help stimulate the economy by reducing the government rules and restrictions that industries say hamper their ability to expand and create jobs. But the policy's critics feared that an unfettered private sector could be dangerous to the economy and the public interest.

 At the heart of what came to be known as Reaganomics was the proposition that the nation could be restored to economic health through fiscally stimulating tax cuts -- the essence of supply-side economic theory -- and by restricting the money supply to contain inflation. Critics of the administration called that combination contradictory.

 Mr. Weidenbaum, a wry and slightly rumpled figure who had long shuttled between government and academic posts, previously at Washington University in St. Louis, proved to be one of the administration's least doctrinaire members, neither full-throated supply-sider nor strict monetarist.

 ''I was sympathetic to both,'' Mr. Weidenbaum said in a 2011 telephone interview for this obituary. But neither side ''thought I was one of them.''

 He was also a prominent advocate of federal revenue-sharing, involving no-strings payments to states and localities. As an assistant secretary of the Treasury under President Richard M. Nixon, he had led a revenue-sharing initiative, which was briefly effective. But he wound up helping President Reagan dismantle the program when revenue sharing did not displace a proliferation of separate grants and payments to state and local governments voted for by Congress.

 Though fiscally conservative, Mr. Weidenbaum was more moderate than some of his peers in the White House. He was generally aligned with administration pragmatists like the budget director, David A. Stockman, and the chief of staff, James A. Baker III. They favored compromising with Democrats in Congress on raising tax revenue and cutting military spending because of their concern about deficits.

 Internal battles over budget deficits were a hallmark of the administration in those years.

 Mr. Weidenbaum, in the 2011 interview, said he left the administration after a year and a half precisely because he was unhappy with the 1983 budget, and chose to quit rather than defend it before Congress.

 Stepping down in August 1982, a time when Mr. Reagan's popularity had plummeted and the country was sinking into a deep recession, Mr. Weidenbaum was replaced by Martin S. Feldstein.

 ''After fighting the good fight, I quietly folded my tent and returned to St. Louis,'' Mr. Weidenbaum said.

 But he left satisfied. In an Op-Ed article in The New York Times afterward, he wrote that the administration had ''achieved significant progress in carrying out its economic recovery program'' and that its deregulation efforts had been successful.

 ''For the first time in decades, no new major regulatory activities were enacted or promulgated,'' he wrote. ''In fact, many burdensome regulations were modified or rescinded.''

 Mr. Weidenbaum also expressed general satisfaction with the administration's policy in a 2005 memoir, ''Advising Reagan: Making Economic Policy, 1981-82.''

 ''It seems clear that, on balance, Reaganomics was a success,'' he wrote. ''The president's policies had injected a new sense of realism into the decision making in the private sector,'' as both management and workers paid more attention to controlling costs and raising productivity.

 Murray Weidenbaum (the first syllable rhymes with ''feed'') was born on Feb. 10, 1927, into a liberal Democratic household in the Bronx. He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn and the City College of New York, where he was elected president of the student body on a platform of ''Wine, Women and Weidenbaum.''

 Mr. Weidenbaum received a master's degree from Columbia University, then joined the New York State Department of Labor as a junior economist. At the time, like his family, he held union-friendly views, and saw labor as the little guy at the mercy of big business. But he grew disillusioned with the labor cause after being assigned to a statistical analysis of a master contract for the Teamsters union. His encounter with an independent trucker who had vainly sought to negotiate on his own was a pivotal moment.

 ''The roles were reversed,'' he said. ''The little employer was dealing with the giant union.''

 Laid off under New York State's ''last in, first out'' policy, he found work in Washington at the Bureau of the Budget. During a leave to pursue doctoral work at Princeton, he met Phyllis Green. They married in 1954.

 Besides his son, Jim, he is survived by two daughters, Laurie Stark and Susan Juster-Goldstein, and six grandchildren.

 After marriage, he began a life characterized by the title of a 2009 autobiographical monograph, ''Vignettes From a Peripatetic Professor,'' moving among academia, government, industry and research institutes in Washington and elsewhere.

 Mr. Weidenbaum had an early, formative stint in the military industry. The General Dynamics Corporation in Fort Worth hired him as an economist and had him analyze the operations of the B-58 supersonic bomber. Moving to Boeing, in Seattle, he developed forecasts of the military market.

 The jobs exposed him to the numerous rules military contractors were subject to, underscored by the full-time presence of inspectors stationed in the factories.

 ''There's more government regulation of the defense industry than any other,'' Mr. Weidenbaum said in the 2011 interview, adding that complaints were seldom voiced for fear of offending the main customer, the government itself.

 After Boeing, he moved to the Stanford Research Institute in California to continue studying the military industry.

 That was followed by a turn in Washington as the staff director of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers.

 He moved to St. Louis in early 1975 when Washington University created the Center for the Study of American Business and recruited him to be its first director. He was there when Mr. Reagan lured him back to the White House.

 Mr. Weidenbaum later served on boards and government commissions, including one on clean air initiatives formed by President George H. W. Bush, and he continued as director of the Washington University business institute. In 2001 it was renamed the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government and Public Policy.

 The center gave him a platform from which to express his views on deficit spending -- ''I conclude that deficits do not matter, but that Treasury borrowing and money creation surely do'' -- and on military spending and other economic matters. It also gave him an opportunity to display his dry sense of humor.

 Speaking at the center's annual policy conference in October 1982, he remarked, ''At a time when, alas, economist jokes are in vogue, I would like to add my favorite wisecrack about our profession: If all the economists in the world were laid end to end, it might be a good thing.''","Murray L.

2014-06-12 00:00:00,10012,"Glenn A. Britt, the longtime chief executive of Time Warner Cable, whose career encompassed the shift from televisions with rabbit ears to streaming video, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 65.

 The cause was melanoma, the company said.

 When Mr. Britt retired as chairman and chief executive in December, Time Warner Cable had 15 million individual or business subscribers to its video, phone or broadband services, including 11.4 million video subscribers.

 Only weeks later, the company agreed to be sold to the media conglomerate Comcast for $45 billion as part of deal that would create a communications powerhouse with about 30 million cable subscribers. Regulators have yet to approve the deal. Before that sale, Mr. Britt and his successor, Rob Marcus, had fought a proposed merger with Charter Communications.

 Time Warner Cable's revenues had grown to $22 billion from $6 billion in 2001, when Mr. Britt was named chief executive of the company, then a division of Time Warner.

 The company has recently lost cable TV subscribers, but it has had offsetting gains in residential high-speed Internet connections, digital phone and business services -- just as Mr. Britt had foreseen, said N. J. Nicholas Jr., a former Time Warner executive who first worked with Mr. Britt in 1974 at Manhattan Cable Television, Time Inc.'s early foray into cable TV.

 ''He'd say, 'Think of cable as a giant media infrastructure play. There are going to be new products to be developed for consumer benefit, but it is not about television. Never has been,' '' Mr. Nicholas said.

 Glenn Alan Britt was born on March 6, 1949, in Hackensack, N.J. He joined Time Inc. in 1972, after graduating from Dartmouth College and its business school.

 Shortly after joining the company, he began working at Manhattan Cable, which served the lower half of the island. He became vice president and treasurer there in 1974.

 In a rare venture into print, Mr. Britt went to Iran in 1977 as part of a Time-Life Books project while the shah was still in power. After a stint at Time Inc.'s cable network HBO, he became the executive responsible for Time Warner Cable's new Road Runner broadband service in the late 1990s.

 In 1999, he became president of Time Warner Cable, and by 2009, when Time Warner spun off the cable company as an independent, publicly traded entity, he became chairman and chief executive.

 He is survived by his wife, Barbara.

 Craig Moffett, a founder of MoffettNathanson, a cable and telecom industry research firm, said Mr. Britt was among the first media executives to publicly proclaim that broadband would become cable companies' core product.

 Noting that the cable industry began in the United States as a series of small local franchises that over time were acquired and reacquired, Mr. Moffett saw the proposed Comcast sale as an apt coda for Mr. Britt's career.

 ''The consolidation that he was a party to through his career finally runs its course with that deal,'' Mr. Moffett said.

 Mr. Britt was not shy about extolling the benefits cable companies brought to the world. In remarks in 2013 to the NYC Media Lab Summit, he said: ''Had it not been for the model created by cable, Google wouldn't exist. Nor would Hulu or Netflix. Maybe it would have eventually happened. Cable first laid the foundation.''","Glenn A.

2014-01-01 00:00:00,29243,"John Dominis, a Life magazine photographer who was known for capturing celebrities, wild animals and presidents at their unguarded best, and who was caught off guard himself while taking his most famous picture -- of two American medal winners raising black-gloved fists at the 1968 Olympics -- died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 92.

 The cause was a heart ailment, said his daughter, Dori Dominis Beer.

 Mr. Dominis was a star among a stable of star photographers at Life, the nation's most popular picture magazine, from 1950 until it ended weekly issues, in 1972.

 Ingratiating, self-effacing and ruggedly handsome, he was often assigned to photograph people who preferred not to be photographed. He spent a month in 1963 with the actor Steve McQueen (nearly feral in his aversion to publicity), who was not yet the superstar he became. He persuaded Frank Sinatra to indulge him for three months in 1965 while he went inside his prickly circle of friends, family, drivers and handlers to photograph his life.

 It was not charm, though, but the reflexes of a professional photographer that helped Mr. Dominis produce his most enduring image.

 On Oct. 16, 1968, when Tommie Smith and John Carlos ascended the Olympic podium in Mexico City to receive medals for finishing first (Mr. Smith) and third (Mr. Carlos) in the men's 200-meter dash -- along with the Australian sprinter Peter Norman, the silver medalist -- Mr. Dominis was one of the few photographers who happened to be in the media pen 20 feet away watching and, he said, ''expecting a normal ceremony.''

 After the athletes had received their medals and ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' began to play, Mr. Dominis was looking through his camera lens when Mr. Smith and Mr. Carlos, bowing their heads, each raised a gloved fist (Mr. Smith wearing the right hand and Mr. Carlos the left of a single pair of gloves) in a black power salute, to protest America's racism.

 ''I didn't think it was a big news event,'' Mr. Dominis told Smithsonian magazine in 2008. ''I hardly noticed what was happening when I was shooting.'' The New York Times reported that the event ''actually passed without much general notice in the packed Olympic Stadium.''

 Mr. Dominis later dismissed his black-and-white picture as ''not much of a photograph.'' But it made the protest an indelible part of the iconography of the tumultuous 1960s.

 Richard B. Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at Life and the founding managing editor of People, said Mr. Dominis was one of the most modest ''great photographers'' he knew, and one of the most poised. ''He had his finger on the trigger all the time,'' he said, while maintaining ''a remarkable calmness.''

 John Frank Michael Dominis was born in Los Angeles on June 27, 1921, the youngest of four children of Paul and Mamie Ostoja Dominis, both immigrants from what is now Croatia. At Fremont High School John studied under Clarence A. Bach, who taught a celebrated three-year photography course there that produced dozens of professionals, including eight staff photographers at Life.

 Mr. Dominis studied filmmaking at the University of Southern California and served in the Army as a combat photographer in Japan during World War II.

 After covering the Korean War for Life, he traveled widely on assignments in Asia and Europe; covered President John F. Kennedy's 1963 trip to Berlin and President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 trip to China; and photographed the Woodstock music festival and five Olympics.

 He spent many months in Africa for a 1966 Life feature ''The Great Cats of Africa'' and later published several books of additional photos from the tour.

 In addition to his daughter, Mr. Dominis's survivors include two sons, Paul and Greg, and seven grandchildren.

 Though he worked as an editor and freelancer for other magazines in later years, Mr. Dominis considered Life magazine the main event of his career.

 At Life, he wrote in an introduction to a 2007 show of his work at the Monroe Gallery in Santa Fe, N.M., ''I received all the support and money and time, whatever was required, to do almost any kind of work I wanted to do, anywhere in the world. It was like having a grant, a Guggenheim grant, but permanently.''","John Dominis, a Life magazine photographer who was known for capturing celebrities, wild animals and presidents at their unguarded best, and who was caught off guard himself while taking his most famous picture -- of two American medal winners raising black-gloved fists at the 1968 Olympics -- died on Monday at his home in Manhattan.","The New York Times                             January 1, 2014 Wednesday                               Late Edition - Final  John Dominis, Photographer, Dies at 92"
2014-06-29 00:00:00,10065,"Leslie F. Manigat, a prominent political figure in Haiti who as its president in 1988 was overthrown in a bloodless military coup after serving in office for less than six months, died Friday at his home in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He was 83.

 Evans Baubrun, deputy secretary of Mr. Manigat's political party, confirmed the death without giving a specific cause. He said that Mr. Manigat had been ill for some time, and that his condition may have been complicated by a recent bout of chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus that has been spreading in Haiti.

 Mr. Manigat (pronounced mahn-ee-GAH), a political-science professor, was elected on Jan. 17, 1988, in army-run voting that was widely seen as rigged. The election was boycotted by the main opposition parties and by most of the electorate.

 A round of balloting three months earlier had been called off after gunmen -- some of them soldiers, witnesses said -- shot into lines of voters and other assailants hacked people to death. More than 34 were killed.

 Opposition figures said the military had orchestrated the bloodshed to ruin Haiti's first free election in three decades after years of dictatorial rule by Jean-Claude Duvalier, who was known as ''Baby Doc,'' and his father, Franois Duvalier, ''Papa Doc.''

 After Mr. Manigat was inaugurated, a three-man ruling junta, headed by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, dissolved itself. It had ruled the country for two years after Jean-Claude Duvalier was deposed and went into exile.

 By mid-June, however, Mr. Manigat and General Namphy were locked in a power struggle, and on June 17 Mr. Manigat sacked the general as commander of the armed forces, accusing him of insubordination. Two days later he proclaimed a reorganization of the Haitian military, which had held sway over the island for much of the previous 200 years.

 General Namphy struck back quickly, using troops loyal to him to seize the national palace in Port-au-Prince and to take Mr. Manigat into custody at his home. General Namphy proclaimed himself president and set up a military government.

 Mr. Manigat had reaffirmed his allegiance to democracy after taking office, and many Haitians lauded him for forming a cabinet of respected intellectuals and technical experts. When he removed General Namphy and other officers, he said he was facilitating the growth of democracy. It was widely believed that the military had restricted Mr. Manigat's policies.

 That September, General Namphy himself was deposed in a coup by noncommissioned officers. Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, chief of the presidential guard and a former Duvalier adviser, declared himself president.

 Mr. Manigat, the author of several books, was an energetic man with a grizzled mustache, a broad smile and large, sometimes mournful eyes. He had a spirited speaking style that went down well with Haitian students. His admirers said he had a sharp, analytical mind. His detractors said he was ambitious, volatile, fond of intrigue.

 Leslie Franois Saint Roc Manigat was born on Aug. 16, 1930, in Port-au-Prince. He was one of the four children of Franois Saint-Surin Manigat, a secondary-school mathematics teacher, and the former Hayde Augustin, an elementary-school teacher.

 Mr. Manigat came from a family of educators and politicians with roots along the conservative north coast of Haiti, where most of the battles that led to independence from France in 1804 were fought. His grandfather, Franois Manigat, was a general and a contender for the presidency at the turn of the 20th century.

 Leslie Manigat attended parochial schools in Port-au-Prince and went on to the Sorbonne in Paris, where he completed the course requirements for a doctorate but did not write a thesis.

 Back in Haiti, he went to work for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1958, Franois Duvalier asked him to establish the School of International Studies at the University of Haiti. He became its first director.

 But in 1960 Mr. Duvalier accused Mr. Manigat of helping instigate a student strike. He went to jail for two months and then fled the country. He remained in exile for 23 years, teaching in France, the United States and Latin America, including Venezuela, and giving speeches urging the ouster of the Duvalier family. (Jean-Claude Duvalier, at 19, succeeded his father on his death in 1971.)

 In 1979, in Venezuela, Mr. Manigat organized a political party, the Rally of Progressive National Democrats, which formed a military wing that an aide said had trained in the hope of invading Haiti in the early 1980s.

 In the years after he returned to Haiti, Mr. Manigat received the Haiti Grand Prize of Literature in 2004, given at the Miami Book Fair International, and ran for president again, in 2006, coming in second behind Ren Prval, himself a former president.

 His wife, Mirlande Manigat, was a candidate in the 2010 presidential election, running as a member of her husband's party.

 Information on his survivors was not available.","Leslie F.

2015-09-22 00:00:00,58319,"MANILA -- Esmail Kiram II, the self-proclaimed sultan of Sulu who in 2013 encouraged a last-ditch, violent effort to regain part of the Malaysian island of Borneo for the Philippines, died on Saturday at a hospital in Zamboanga City in the southern Philippines. He was 75.

 A sultanate spokesman, Abraham Idjirani, said the cause was kidney failure. Mr. Kiram was buried on Monday in an ancestral graveyard on Jolo Island in the Sulu Archipelago.

 Though he claimed the title of sultan of Sulu, several other descendants of the original sultan, who lived in the 15th century, make the same claim. Before Spanish colonizers arrived in the 16th century, the sultanate of Sulu ruled over vast stretches of territory, including parts of what is now the southern Philippines and Borneo.

 Mr. Kiram, who was born on Nov. 9, 1939, in Maimbung, the Philippines, issued a directive for the descendants of the original sultan to unite in the peaceful pursuit of the sultanate's historical claim to the part of Borneo that borders the southern Philippines, Mr. Idjirani said in a text message. Mr. Kiram's younger brother, Phugdal Kiram, was named the new sultan, he said.

 With the support of Mr. Kiram, the previous sultan, Jamalul Kiram III, ordered several hundred fighters to invade the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo in 2013 to reclaim the area for the sultanate and for the Philippines.

 The attack left more than 60 people dead, set off the most serious security crisis in Malaysia in more than a decade and strained the country's relationship with the Philippines.

 The sultanate's claim to parts of Borneo is based on past control over the area, and the Philippine government has said repeatedly that it continues to study the issue and has not given up on the claim.

 The Kirams say Sabah was leased to Malaysia. Malaysian officials contend that, in exchange for lease payments to the Kirams, the sultanate ceded the territory to their country.

 Over the years, the once powerful sultanate of Sulu has lost influence to other groups, becoming essentially a symbolic organization, said Richard Javad Heydarian, a political science professor at De La Salle University in Manila.

 ''As the botched Sabah operation showed, their political influence is very limited,'' he said.

 The Philippine government signed a landmark peace agreement in 2012 with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest Muslim separatist group in the country. The smaller Moro National Liberation Front, which is allied with some of the descendants of the sultan of Sulu, was largely left out of the peace talks. Other factions on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao have replaced the political power of the sultanate, Mr. Heydarian said.

 ''Mindanao has gradually moved to a postsultanate era, which is dominated by rebels, warlords and modern warfare,'' he said.","Esmail Kiram II, the self-proclaimed sultan of Sulu who in 2013 encouraged a last-ditch, violent effort to regain part of the Malaysian island of Borneo for the Philippines, died on Saturday at a hospital in Zamboanga City in the southern Philippines.","The New York Times                             September 22, 2015 Tuesday                          The New York Times on the Web  Esmail Kiram II, Self-Proclaimed Sultan of Sulu, Dies at 75"
2015-06-18 00:00:00,41486,"Ron Clarke, an Australian middle- and long-distance runner who broke 17 world records, some by huge margins, in the mid-1960s but never won an Olympic or British Commonwealth gold medal, died on Wednesday in Gold Coast, Australia, where he had recently been mayor. He was 78.

 The Gold Coast City Council confirmed the death, giving the cause as kidney failure. He had been treated for heart disease as well after sustaining permanent heart damage in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.

 Clarke almost always ran from the front, which was often his undoing. Still, from 1963 through 1970 he won 202 of 313 races, ranging from a half-mile to the marathon (26.2 miles).

 His most remarkable feat came in 1965, when, on a 44-day tour of Europe, he broke 12 world records in 18 races. The records included, four days apart, the first three miles under 13 minutes and the first 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) under 28 minutes. At the time, Athletics Weekly, a British track and field magazine, called his three-mile record (12 minutes 52.4 seconds) ''the most prodigious in the long history of track running.''

 In top-level races on the track, front-runners are usually run down by others. Clarke had the speed to run fast at the end, but he seldom waited. He told the former distance runner Kenny Moore of Sports Illustrated, ''I loved testing myself more than I feared being beaten, and front-running is the ultimate test.''

 Clarke was involved in what has been called one of the great moments of sportsmanship. In the 1956 Australian championships, he was leading halfway through the mile when another runner clipped his heel. Clarke fell, and the world-record holder, John Landy, trying to hurdle over him, cut him with a spike.

 Landy stopped, went back, helped Clarke to his feet and apologized. Clarke said he was fine and urged him to keep going. Landy, by then 30 yards behind, resumed the chase and, in a tremendous burst of speed, caught the rest of the field and won.

 Landy's reaching out to help Clarke up was memorialized in a bronze statue of the two that stands at the entrance to a sports-and-entertainment complex in Melbourne.

 Like that one, many of Clarke's most memorable moments were not necessarily triumphs.

 In the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Clarke, at 19, after failing to make the Australian team, was the final torchbearer in the opening ceremony and lit the Olympic flame. The torch sparked, and chunks of burning magnesium fell on his arm. The organizers had not given him a ticket, so he went to an uncle's home nearby and watched the rest of the ceremony on television.

 In the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Clarke was the favorite in the 10,000 meters and led at one point in the final lap. But Billy Mills, an unheralded American, won the gold medal; Mohamed Gammoudi of Tunisia, the silver; and Clarke, the bronze. Clarke also ran the 5,000 meters and the marathon in the same Olympics, finishing ninth each time.

 And in the Mexico City Olympics, he finished sixth in the 10,000, collapsed from a lack of oxygen (the city is almost a mile and a half above sea level) and was unconscious for 10 minutes. He sustained permanent heart damage and eventually had a heart valve replaced.

 Ronald William Clarke was born on Feb. 21, 1937, in Melbourne. His father, Tom, and his older brother, Jack, were outstanding Australian rules football players. Ron took up running, he said, because he was not good enough for Australian football. The Clarkes were among Australia's most celebrated sports families.

 Clarke's running preparation was unusual. He trained almost daily all year, with almost the same workouts. For a while he ran three times a day on grass and roads, seldom on a track, all the while working full time as a corporation accountant. Unlike other runners, he never timed his workouts and never kept a training diary.

 He retired from competition at 33 because, he said, ''it is the little things I missed, like putting the kids to bed.'' But he kept running for fun with friends, on Sunday mornings, doing 17 miles uphill on gravel.

 Clarke became a sports shoe executive, travel agent, newspaper columnist, author and charity fund-raiser. He was the mayor of Gold Coast, an eastern Australian city of a half-million residents, from 2004 to 2012. While in office he helped secure the 2018 Commonwealth Games for the city. Clarke was named to the Order of Australia and the Order of the British Empire, and in 1985, he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

 He is survived by his wife, Helen; his sons, Marcus and Nicolas; and a number of grandchildren. A daughter, Monique, died in 2009. His brother, Jack, died in 2001 at 68.

 As successful as Clarke was as a runner, many thought there were things about him that had never emerged. The celebrated Australian coach Percy Cerutty said: ''He was gifted physically. His records prove it, but he had no real mental drive. When he came up against men with spirit, he let them beat him.''

 And Derek Clayton, a friend and once the world's best marathoner, said: ''I know Clarkey better than he does himself. No emotions. The man couldn't lift himself in the important competitions. A machine. The Olympics or a club race, it was all the same to him.''","Ron Clarke, an Australian middle- and long-distance runner who broke 17 world records, some by huge margins, in the mid-1960s but never won an Olympic or British Commonwealth gold medal, died on Wednesday in Gold Coast, Australia, where he had recently been mayor.","The New York Times                               June 18, 2015 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Ron Clarke, 78, Star Runner With Records and Setbacks"
2015-05-18 00:00:00,41384,"In January 1978, the mayor of New York, Edward I. Koch, issued an executive order banning discrimination in city agencies on the basis of ''sexual orientation or affectional preference.'' Less than three weeks later, in an essay on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, Samuel DeMilia, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, declared that the mayor's order would be ''unworkable in the Police Department, and can do more harm than good.

 ''Sociability, vital to building a cohesive force, can never develop with homosexuals for obvious reasons,'' Mr. DeMilia wrote. He added: ''The overt homosexual is distinguished by his speech, mannerisms, conduct and dress. These have generally been received negatively by the public. There is no reason to believe that public attitudes toward these features that distinguish homosexuals will change once he puts on a police officer's uniform.''

 The following year, Sam Ciccone, a sergeant in the Fairview, N.J., police department, quit his job there after 15 years spent concealing his sexual orientation. He moved to New York, and in 1982 he and Charles H. Cochrane Jr., a gay New York City police sergeant, founded the Gay Officers Action League, known as GOAL, the first organization to address the needs and concerns of gay and lesbian law enforcement personnel. Similar groups have since arisen throughout the United States and abroad.

 Mr. Ciccone was 71 when he died on May 10 at his apartment in Manhattan. His nephew Joseph Ciccone, a former New Jersey police officer who is now a Roman Catholic priest, confirmed the death. Edgar Rodriguez, a friend and a former police officer, said the cause was heart disease.

 Sergeant Cochrane died in 2008.

 As an activist, Mr. Ciccone (pronounced chih-KO-nee) preferred to work behind the scenes, but he was known as a clever strategist, a persuasive debater and an effective conciliator. He maintained that an essential part of GOAL's mission was in fact better policing, and that the department needed to be more sensitive not only to the concerns of its gay officers but also to those of the gay community; the public weal required a mutual respect.

 In an interview, Matt Foreman, a co-chairman in the 1980s of Heritage of Pride, which organized the gay pride parade, recalled that before Mr. Ciccone became involved, the relationship between the gay community and police officers was so antagonistic that the organizers refused to apply for a parade permit. Mr. Ciccone, he said, ''was instrumental'' in bringing the parade committee and the police together.

 Mr. Foreman later served as executive director of the New York City Anti-Violence Project. During a spike in anti-gay violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he said, Mr. Ciccone helped persuade the Police Department to add resources in Greenwich Village and Chelsea, neighborhoods with a substantial number of gay residents and businesses. Mr. Ciccone also helped the anti-violence project write a curriculum for the city's Police Academy to help teach recruits about dealing with gay people as crime victims.

 ''Sam made a very important difference at a very challenging time,'' Mr. Foreman said.

 Salvatore Ciccone was born in Englewood, N.J., on March 18, 1944, a son of Nicholas Ciccone, a union painter, and Ida Pinzone. He grew up in Fairview and graduated from Cliffside Park High School, in a neighboring town. He joined the Fairview Police Department in 1964, rising to the rank of detective sergeant.

 ''He loved being a cop,'' said Carl Locke, a New York City detective and the current president of GOAL. ''He told me that if they would put him on, he'd do the job for free. But he said that in the '60s he was so afraid people would find out about him that his life was so miserable that he had to leave policing.''

 About a dozen people attended the first meeting of GOAL, held in the basement of St. Joseph's Church in Greenwich Village. Patrick Suraci, a psychologist working for the department, said in an interview on Friday that Sergeant Cochrane, who had been publicly open about being gay, had received a bomb threat, but that many of the others in the room were still in the closet and fearful that their secret would be revealed.

 For several years that remained the case for many gay police officers, including those on the board of GOAL. (The organization's mission now states that it includes under its protective umbrella ''active duty and retired lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) law enforcement officers and other personnel of recognized law enforcement institutions.'')

 In an interview, Mr. Rodriguez, now a retired sergeant, recalled attending his first meeting, in the late 1980s, with great trepidation, and watching Mr. Ciccone argue that the organization needed to be represented by people who were out of the closet. Mr. Rodriguez said Mr. Ciccone became a father figure to him.

 ''Largely due to Sam, his friendship and mentorship, I went from being a frightened, closeted gay cop to being president of the organization,'' Mr. Rodriguez said.

 Mr. Ciccone later earned a law degree at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, and worked for the firm Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik. He wrote an autobiographical play, ''Nothing to Report,'' about the travails of a gay cop, which was produced Off Broadway in 1987.

 Mr. Ciccone is survived by his partner, Ta-Wei Yu, a pianist, and three sisters, Mildred Hutton, Patricia Vitti and Barbara Mastropolo.

 Detective Locke said GOAL now has some 2,000 members. Among Mr. Ciccone's other accomplishments, he said, was pushing to have GOAL accepted by the Police Department as a legitimate fraternal organization, and helping to advance police recruitment in the gay community.

 ''I went to the academy in 2001 as an openly gay man, a change that was hard for Sam to believe,'' Detective Locke said.

 Mr. Ciccone and Sergeant Cochrane, he added, were fighting to be recognized and fighting for equality. ''We have that now,'' he said. ''We have that place at the table. He and Charlie -- they changed policing forever.''","In January 1978, the mayor of New York, Edward I.

2015-10-10 00:00:00,54694,"Jerry S. Parr, the Secret Service agent credited with saving President Ronald Reagan's life during an assassination attempt in 1981, died Friday at a hospice near his home in Washington. He was 85.

 The death was confirmed by Mr. Parr's wife, Carolyn, who said he died of congestive heart failure.

 Mr. Parr was just feet away from Mr. Reagan when John W. Hinckley Jr. opened fire on the president outside the Washington Hilton hotel on March 30, 1981.

 ''When he was about probably six or seven feet from the car, I heard these shots,'' Mr. Parr said in a 2013 interview promoting the memoir he wrote with his wife. ''I sort of knew what they were, and I'd been waiting for them all of my career, in a way. That's what every agent waits for, is that.''

 Mr. Parr grabbed the president, shoved him into a waiting limousine and then jumped in on top of him. A shift supervisor grabbed both men's feet, shoved them further inside and slammed the door behind them, Mr. Parr said. Mr. Parr then shouted to the driver, ''Take off!''

 ''Somehow intuitively I just looked out the back window as we were moving, and I saw three bodies on the sidewalk,'' he said.

 At that point, alone with Mr. Reagan in the back of the limousine, Mr. Parr did not know that the president had been wounded.

 ''I thought, 'We're clear,' and then he started spitting up blood,'' Mr. Parr said. ''I looked at it and I said, 'I'm taking you to the hospital.' ''

 Mr. Parr diverted the president's limousine from its route to the White House to the emergency room of the George Washington University Medical Center.

 At the hospital, Mr. Reagan, who was shot once with a .22-caliber bullet, was initially reported in good condition, and underwent surgery for two hours. He returned to the White House 12 days later.

 ''Without Jerry looking out for Ronnie on March 30, 1981, I would have certainly lost my best friend and roommate to an assassin's bullet,'' Mr. Reagan's widow, Nancy, in a statement reported by CNN on Friday night. ''Jerry was not only one of the finest Secret Service agents to ever serve this country, but one of the most decent human beings I've ever known. He was humble but strong, reserved but confident, and blessed with a great sense of humor. It is no wonder that he and my husband got along so well.''

 The wounded whom Mr. Parr saw on the sidewalk were Agent Timothy McCarthy of the Secret Service, Officer Thomas Delahanty of the Washington police force and James S. Brady, the White House press secretary. All three survived. Mr. Brady was the most seriously injured, suffering a grave head injury. He became a tireless advocate for gun control and died in August 2014.

 Mr. Parr was an agent for 23 years, his wife said, and retired in 1985. His fascination with the service began as a child, he wrote, when his father took him to see the 1939 film ''Code of the Secret Service,'' which starred a young Mr. Reagan as Agent Brass Bancroft.

 ''It was such a strange thing that me,'' Mr. Parr said, ''seeing his image on a film when I was 9 years old, and then I ended up helping save his life.''

 The president was at the hospital minutes after Mr. Hinckley's gun went off, and Mr. Parr's grace under fire and quick thinking were widely considered as having saved Mr. Reagan's life.

 ''That's not something you prepared for,'' Ms. Parr said in a telephone interview on Friday night.

 When Mr. Reagan awoke the morning after the assassination attempt, The Associated Press reported in 1981, one of his first requests was to speak to Mr. Parr. Donald T. Regan, the treasury secretary at the time, told The A.P. that the president wanted to apologize to Mr. Parr because, not immediately realizing that he had been shot, he first thought his chest pains had been caused by Mr. Parr's shove.

 ''He was proud of his work,'' Ms. Parr said. ''He felt very satisfied with his work. He felt like it was a great privilege.''

 Besides his wife, a retired judge, Mr. Parr is survived by three daughters, Kimberly Parr, Patricia Parr and Jennifer Parr Turek, and four granddaughters.

 Ms. Parr said she and her husband would have celebrated their 56th wedding anniversary next week. Mr. Parr, in his last Twitter message in July, posted a photo of himself and his wife accompanied by three words: ''Love Is Enough.''","Jerry S.

2015-05-29 00:00:00,41410,"Michael King, who with his brother transformed King World Productions, a modest company they inherited from their father, into a syndicator of television megahits like ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ''Jeopardy!'' and ''Wheel of Fortune,'' died on Wednesday in Los Angeles. He was 67.

 The cause was a lingering infection, said Robert V. Madden, a friend and former King family lawyer.

 The King brothers seized an opening for independently produced and syndicated game shows and talk shows in the 1970s, when federal regulations limited how much programming the three major networks could own.

 Their eye for talent and salesmanship to local station managers helped make stars of Alex Trebek, Dr. Phil McGraw, Rachael Ray and Roseanne Barr, and transformed Ms. Winfrey into the nation's top-rated daytime talk show host.

 By the mid-1990s, the proliferation of cable television, satellite networks and home video led the government to relax the ownership restrictions on network television, allowing the Kings to sell their company to CBS in 1999 for $2.5 billion in CBS stock. At the time, Michael King was King World's vice chairman and Roger King was chairman.

 Roger King, an imposing 6-foot-4, 250-pound salesman, became chief executive of CBS Television Distribution. Michael King became a consultant to CBS. More than a decade ago he was a part owner of the New Jersey Devils hockey franchise, which later merged financially with the New York Yankees. At his death he owned King Sports Worldwide, a boxing promotion company in Los Angeles.

 King World was started by Charles King in 1964 with syndication rights to radio programs and the classic 1930s Hal Roach ''Our Gang'' comedy shorts (which had been renamed ''The Little Rascals'' for television). His children inherited the company on his death in 1972, and they built it into the television industry's dominant distributor of game and talk shows. For a time they were the richest family in the industry.

 By 1982 they had persuaded Merv Griffin to let them distribute his ''Wheel of Fortune'' game show, and two years later they took their company public.

 By 1988, ''Wheel of Fortune'' was said to be earning $125 million a year in advertising revenue and syndication fees, while costing $6 million to produce and $20 million to sell and distribute. The resulting profits of $100 million or so, before taxes, was split between the producer, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and King World.

 On a typical day in the late 1980s, 90 million people watched at least one of the company's three biggest shows -- ''Wheel of Fortune,'' ''Jeopardy!'' and ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.''

 Michael Gordon King, a son of Charles and Lucille King, was born in Rahway, N.J., on March 8, 1948. He assumed the title of president of King World, at a salary of $150 week, soon after graduating from Fairleigh Dickinson University.

 In 1975, he joined his brother Roger in Fort Lauderdale at WKID-TV, where they co-hosted an all-night talk show and sold advertising to, among others, the mobster Meyer Lansky, who was promoting his dinner theater.

 ''I said, 'Meyer, every time I come down here, I come down with 10 fingers,' '' Michael King recalled. '' 'If I go back with 10 fingers, I feel like I done good.' ''

 Michael, who was four years younger and considered less mercurial than Roger, returned to King World with his brother two years later.

 Roger King died in 2007. Michael is survived by his wife, Jena; their three children, Theodore, Audrey and Jesse; and a daughter, Alexandra, from a previous marriage.

 Mr. King once said that he had wanted to be a rock star. (He settled for hiring the ex-Doobie Brother Michael McDonald to play at his 40th birthday party.) But he also relished his vicarious role in the entertainment industry. At one point he bought the rights to a library of vintage movies.

 ''I love owning Sherlock Holmes,'' he told an interviewer. ''If anybody wants to run Sherlock Holmes, anywhere in the world, they have to call Roger and me. Isn't that wild?''

 Mr. King considered himself a champion of film and television, as the studio moguls of yesteryear were.

 '''I measure myself against -- and this is going to sound egotistical -- Louis B. Mayer, Sam Goldwyn, Jack Warner, David O. Selznick, Mike Todd,'' he said in an interview with The New York Times Magazine. ''Those people created this industry, and unfortunately our industry is run by a lot of people who aren't passionate about it. Not only are they not passionate about it, they're not filmmakers, they're not television people. They're lawyers and accountants and businessmen.

 ''We have a passion for this company and this industry,'' he continued. ''We made Pat Sajak and Vanna White major stars. We did it like the old studio system.''","Michael King, who with his brother transformed King World Productions, a modest company they inherited from their father, into a syndicator of television megahits like ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ''Jeopardy!''","The New York Times                                May 29, 2015 Friday                               Late Edition - Final  Michael King, 67, Builder of a TV Empire"
2016-05-05 00:00:00,26877,"Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, the deposed president of Burundi who invested heavily in infrastructure but persecuted Catholics and did little to make his small, poor and ethnically fractured country a stable democracy, died on Wednesday morning at a hospital in Brussels. He was 69.

 The death was confirmed by Pierre Nkurunziza, Burundi's current president. No cause of death was provided.

 The rule of Mr. Bagaza -- who seized power in a 1976 coup and was ousted, also in a coup, in 1987 -- reflected the political instability that has characterized Burundi, a landlocked but densely populated central African nation, for much of its modern history.

 Burundi today is in crisis. Violence has skyrocketed, with reports of mass killings and torture of political dissidents, after Mr. Nkurunziza's decision in April last year to seek a third term, despite huge protests and international condemnation.

 Mr. Nkurunziza maintains that because he was first elected in 2005 by lawmakers, his first term should not count toward the two-term limit specified in the Constitution.

 A former colony of Germany and Belgium, Burundi achieved independence in 1962. An Army officer, Michel Micombero, seized power in 1966 and declared the country a republic, ending a short-lived constitutional monarchy. Longstanding tensions between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis culminated in a Hutu uprising that was brutally crushed in the early 1970s, when at least 100,000 Hutus were killed. Mr. Bagaza was an army logistics officer at the time, but the extent or nature of his involvement in the violence, if any, was never made clear.

 In November 1976, Mr. Bagaza, by then a lieutenant colonel and deputy chief of staff of the army, deposed Mr. Micombero in a bloodless coup. Like his predecessor, Colonel Bagaza was a Tutsi, though he made appeals to national unity and included two Hutus in his first cabinet. The military, however, remained firmly under the control of the Tutsis, even though they represented no more than 15 percent of the population.

 Mr. Bagaza's investments in infrastructure contributed to the development of an economy that remains largely reliant on its exports of coffee, tea and sugar.

 ''Before his time there were hardly any easily passable roads,'' Nigel Watt, the author of ''Burundi: The Biography of a Small African Country'' (2008), said in a phone interview. Mr. Bagaza had roads built connecting Bujumbura, the capital, to the interior; invested in electricity and drinking water; developed a port on Lake Tanganyika, linking Burundi's economy with that of neighboring Tanzania; and, at a time of Cold War tensions, managed to secure aid from both the West and the Soviet bloc, as well as China and the Arab states.

 Mr. Bagaza was credited with land reforms, the abolition of a hated poll tax and the promulgation of a new Constitution in 1981. But his human rights record was poor.

 In 1980, The New York Times noted that Mr. Bagaza was building a presidential palace on the highest hill in Bujumbura with economic help from North Korea, and that mistrust and paranoia pervaded the country, with many Hutus who had fled to Tanzania during the genocide still fearful of return. Many continued to feel like second-class citizens, with limited access to education and to jobs in government.

 Mr. Bagaza's undoing may have resulted from his eccentricities. He ruthlessly pursued the Roman Catholic Church -- in a country where more than 60 percent of the population is Catholic -- by imprisoning priests, reducing the number of foreign missionaries and seizing or closing church-run broadcasters, schools and seminaries. (He accused church leaders of trying to interfere in politics.) He restricted the opening hours of bars, and even tried to stop Burundians from spending their time and money on traditional betrothal and mourning ceremonies, along with weddings and funerals.

 ''In attacking Christian churches, he made both political and spiritual enemies,'' Robert C. Krueger, a former American ambassador to Burundi, wrote in his 2007 book on the country, ''From Bloodshed to Hope in Burundi: Our Embassy Years During Genocide.'' ''That was too much even for Burundi.''

 In September 1987, Mr. Bagaza was overthrown while attending a conference of French-speaking nations in Quebec.

 Burundi's fortunes did not improve significantly, however. Under his successor, Pierre Buyoya, there were new waves of ethnic violence. The country's first democratically elected president and first Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, was overthrown in 1993 after only three months in power, and large numbers of Tutsis were killed in what has been labeled a second genocide. (Mr. Ndadaye's successor was assassinated in a plane crash in April 1994, while traveling with the president of Rwanda, an event that precipitated the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus.)

 Some Burundians suspected Mr. Bagaza -- who was variously exiled in Libya and Uganda -- of taking part in the coup against Mr. Ndadaye, but he denied it. After returning to Burundi, he attempted a political comeback as the leader of a hard-line Tutsi-led party, Parena, but was thwarted when his longtime rival Mr. Buyoya returned to power in a 1996 coup. As part of a 2005 peace process that ended a 12-year civil war and resulted in the election of Mr. Nkurunziza, former presidents, including Mr. Bagaza, were named senators for life. He stepped down as the head of Parena in 2014.

 Born in Rutovu, in what is now southern Burundi, on Aug. 26, 1946, Mr. Bagaza attended Belgian military schools before joining Burundi's army. He is survived by his wife, Fausta, and four daughters.","Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, the deposed president of Burundi who invested heavily in infrastructure but persecuted Catholics and did little to make his small, poor and ethnically fractured country a stable democracy, died on Wednesday morning at a hospital in Brussels.","The New York Times                                May 5, 2016 Thursday                               Late Edition - Final  Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, 69, Deposed President of Burundi"
2016-05-10 00:00:00,26893,"David Hall, a former governor of Oklahoma who maintained he was innocent long after an indictment complicated his public legacy, died on Friday at a hospital near his home in San Diego. He was 85.

 His daughter Julie Martin said he died after suffering a stroke. He was already in the hospital when doctors discovered a blood clot, she said.

 Mr. Hall, a Democrat, served one term as governor, from 1971 to 1975, and was indicted on federal racketeering and extortion charges three days after leaving office. He was later convicted of bribery and extortion and served 19 months of a three-year sentence.

 He maintained he was innocent and went on to write a book about his experience.

 David Walters, a fellow Democrat who was governor from 1991 to 1995, praised Mr. Hall's willingness to increase revenue during tough financial times.

 ''His own financial controversies and accusations -- which led, of course, to conviction -- cloud his administration, but he had the courage at the time to raise revenues when the state desperately needed them,'' Mr. Walters said.

 Oklahoma's current governor, Mary Fallin, a Republican, noted in a statement that Mr. Hall ''focused on the state's education system and was committed to expanding Oklahoma's roads.''

 In addition to Ms. Martin, Mr. Hall's survivors include his wife, Jo Evans Hall, and two other children, Doug Hall and Nancy Zumwalt.","David Hall, a former governor of Oklahoma who maintained he was innocent long after an indictment complicated his public legacy, died on Friday at a hospital near his home in San Diego.","The New York Times                                May 10, 2016 Tuesday                               Late Edition - Final  Former Gov.

2016-02-12 00:00:00,26590,"KATHMANDU, Nepal -- Sushil Koirala, who as the prime minister of Nepal was an important force behind the adoption in September of the country's first democratic Constitution drafted by an elected assembly, died here on Tuesday. He was 77.

 His doctor, Karbir Nath Yogi, said the cause was respiratory failure from pneumonia. Mr. Koirala had survived tongue and lung cancer, Dr. Yogi said.

 Mr. Koirala was leader of the Nepali Congress, the country's largest political party, which is considered the founding party of democratic Nepal. In a country that had been ruled by a monarchy for 239 years, he fought for democracy throughout his political career.

 His death left uncertain the future leadership of the Nepali Congress, which is currently in the opposition, as it prepares for a general convention in March.

 As prime minister, Mr. Koirala presided over the adoption of the Constitution, which established seven provinces and sought to reinforce Nepal as a secular, democratic republic while protecting religion. Long delayed, it emerged from a tumultuous period in Nepalese history, including a decade-long civil war led by Maoists, the overthrow of the monarchy in 2008 and a devastating earthquake in April.

 The Constitution was adopted over the objections of the country's minorities, whose leaders say that a system of proportional representation in Parliament and the size and borders of the provinces have conspired to deny them a political voice. Demonstrations erupted in particular in the minority Madhesi community in Nepal's southern plains.

 The Madhesis have ethnic and cultural ties to India, and at the major trade crossing between the two countries there were sit-ins that blocked fuel deliveries into Nepal, creating severe fuel shortages.

 Nepali officials blamed India, saying it had sanctioned an unofficial blockade in response to the way the Constitution had been pushed through the legislature. India said the sit-ins had made the passage of fuel impossible.

 On Monday, Madhesi leaders called off the sit-in after Parliament passed an amendment to the Constitution addressing some of their demands.

 Mr. Koirala was born in the city of Biratnagar, in eastern Nepal, to one of Nepal's most influential political families. Sources differ on his date of birth, but a nephew, Ramesh Bhandari said he was born in December 1938.

 Mr. Koirala took an interest in acting before entering politics. Inspired by the anti-monarchy movement, he joined the Nepali Congress in 1954. He was related to B.P. Koirala, the Nepali Congress's founding father and its first elected prime minister.

 Mr. Koirala spent 16 years in political exile in India after King Mahendra expelled all anti-monarchy protesters in 1960. He was jailed for six years in India and Nepal after he and fellow party members hijacked a plane flying from Biratnagar to Kathmandu and forced it to land in India. Mr. Koirala was arrested, but the others made off with three million Indian rupees to finance the party.

 Mr. Koirala became the president of the Nepali Congress in 2010 and was elected prime minister in February 2014. He had agreed to step down after the Constitution was adopted, to pave the way for new leadership, but had a change of heart and decided to seek re-election in October. He was defeated by K.P. Sharma Oli, the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal.

 Mr. Koirala, who had a staid demeanor and lived austerely, never married. His survivors include his brothers Bijaya and Ashok and his sisters Abhadevi Sharma and Sashi Sharma.","Sushil Koirala, who as the prime minister of Nepal was an important force behind the adoption in September of the country's first democratic Constitution drafted by an elected assembly, died here on Tuesday.","The New York Times                              February 12, 2016 Friday                          The New York Times on the Web  Sushil Koirala, Ex-Premier of Nepal Who Fought for Democracy, Dies at 77"
2016-05-30 00:00:00,22881,"HIGHLIGHT:As chief executive he grew the company from a faltering $600 million operation to a $20 billion juggernaut, but he had less success at RJR Nabisco.

 Charles M. Harper, who in the 1970s and 1980s transformed a faltering food company called ConAgra into a global giant to rival Kraft and Kellogg, and whose own health issues inspired the creation of the brand Healthy Choice, died on Saturday at his home in Omaha. He was 88.

 His death was confirmed by his daughter Kathleen Wenngatz, who said he had been in gradual decline.

 In 1985, when ConAgra's expansion was in full swing, Mr. Harper had a heart attack and was forced to change his eating habits. This led him to introduce a line of lower-calorie products, which ended up being called Healthy Choice. In part inspired by a turkey chili dish made by Mr. Harper's wife, Joan, Healthy Choice meals aimed to be tasty as well as healthier. ""She was a great cook,"" Ms. Wenngatz said. ""He brought that idea to the company.""

 Sales of Healthy Choice took off quickly, and the line is still offered by ConAgra.

 ""This is a rare case of a C.E.O. coming up with a product that changed the company,"" said William Leach, who followed ConAgra as a stock analyst when Mr. Harper was chief executive.

 Later in his career, Mr. Harper was chief executive of RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco company in which Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a leveraged buyout firm, had a large stake.

 ""He was a no-nonsense executive who worked tirelessly and pushed his team hard,"" Henry R. Kravis, co-founder of K.K.R. said in an email. ""He inherited the investigation into the health issues associated with tobacco smoking at RJR, and handled those exceptionally well.""

 At ConAgra, Mr. Harper oversaw one of the most notable turnarounds in postwar corporate America. He joined ConAgra in 1974 after 20 years at Pillsbury, another food company. ConAgra at the time was suffering losses that had put it close to bankruptcy. Mr. Harper, who was known as Mike and wore short-sleeved shirts in the dead of winter, became the chief executive in 1976 and was in that post until 1992.

 Over that period, the company's sales grew to over $20 billion from $600 million and its stock price rose many times over. Much of the growth came from acquiring scores of companies, a strategy that can come undone without financial discipline. But Mr. Harper told his executives to push uncompromisingly for profits without taking on too much debt.

 ""He would literally buy anything related to the food business,"" said Mr. Leach, the former analyst. ""It got a little stretched, but somehow he made it work.""

 Fortune magazine wrote that Mr. Harper gave executives undershorts emblazoned with ""20 percent ROE,"" referring to ""return on equity,"" a yardstick that expresses profits as a percentage of equity invested in a business.

 Mr. Harper became chief executive of RJR Nabisco in 1993. Mr. Kravis hoped that his skills would revive the company. But Mr. Harper struggled, in part because of challenges facing the cigarette business, and he left RJR Nabisco in 1996.

 Mr. Harper's last months at the company were marked by controversy. At RJR's annual meeting, he suggested that infants who were endangered by their parents' smoking could crawl out of the room. Mr. Harper later explained that he was exaggerating to make the point that it was up to the parents to protect their children from cigarette smoke.

 Charles Michael Harper was born on Sept. 26, 1927, in Lansing, Mich. His father, Charles, was a hearing aid salesman, and his mother, the former Alma Anna Michel, helped her husband in that business. Mr. Harper was an undergraduate at Purdue University and got an M.B.A. at the University of Chicago. He married Joan Bruggema in 1950. She died in 1999.

 In addition to his daughter Kathleen, Mr. Harper is survived by two other daughters, Elizabeth Murphy and Carolyn Harper; a son, Charles Jr., a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic; 11 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.

2016-03-22 00:00:00,26722,"COPENHAGEN -- Anker Jorgensen, a former prime minister of Denmark who opposed the Vietnam War and favored establishing a Palestinian state, has died. He was 93.

 Mr. Jorgensen's party, the Social Democrats, announced his death but did not provide the date or the cause.

 Mr. Jorgensen led Danish governments in 1972 and 1973 and from 1975 to 1982, a time when Denmark was marred by political turmoil and economic problems. He resigned in 1982 after failing to get support for tax increases and spending cuts he had proposed to deal with the ailing economy.

 He was a trade union leader with no government experience when he was picked to succeed Prime Minister Jens Otto Krag, who resigned for personal reasons in 1972.

 Mr. Jorgensen described his selection as ''a bit of a shock,'' adding, ''Somebody has to do the job, so I accepted.''

 Danes appreciated Mr. Jorgenson's humble demeanor and called him by his first name. Instead of moving into the prime minister's official residence, he and his family stayed in their apartment in a working-class neighborhood of Copenhagen.

 Mr. Jorgensen drew criticism from Washington and NATO allies for opposing the Vietnam War and calling for diplomatic ties with Communist East Germany. He also supported the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, and said the Palestinians should have their own state.

 As opposition leader in the 1980s, he argued that Denmark should be neutral in the Cold War and that NATO warships should be barred from carrying nuclear arms in Danish waters. The opposition forced early elections in 1988, but the pro-Atlantic alliance, right-leaning minority government that took over after Mr. Jorgensen was able to stay in power.

 He stepped down as leader of the Social Democrats in 1989.

 Anker Henrik Jorgensen was born on July 13, 1922, in Copenhagen. His father drove a horse-drawn streetcar, and his mother was a cleaner.

 His wife of 48 years, the former Ingrid Pedersen, died in 1997. They had two sons and two daughters. Information on his survivors was not immediately available.","Anker Jorgensen, a former prime minister of Denmark who opposed the Vietnam War and favored establishing a Palestinian state, has died.","The New York Times                               March 22, 2016 Tuesday                          The New York Times on the Web  Anker Jorgensen, Former Prime Minister of Denmark, Dies at 93"
2017-02-26 00:00:00,50798,"Theodore J. Lowi, a venerated political scientist who challenged conventional scholarship on presidential power and identified the emergence of what he called ''interest-group liberalism,'' died on Feb. 17 in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 85.

 His death was confirmed by his daughter, Anna Lowi.

 Professor Lowi taught at Cornell University from 1959 to 1965, returned in 1972 and remained the John L. Senior professor of American institutions until he was granted emeritus status in 2015. Coupling academic expertise with charisma, he popularized his theories with an evangelical zeal and a Southern drawl in lectures, television appearances and groundbreaking books, which he was said to have dictated verbatim into a tape recorder.

 They included ''The End of Liberalism: The Second Republic of the United States'' (1969), ''The Politics of Disorder'' (1971), ''American Government: Incomplete Conquest'' (1976) and ''Hyperpolitics: An Interactive Dictionary of Political Science'' (2010), written with Mauro Calise. He also edited ''The Pursuit of Justice'' (1964), Robert F. Kennedy's book about his tenure as attorney general.

 Professor Lowi was named the nation's most influential political scientist in a poll of the American Political Science Association's members in 1978. He was the president of that group in 1991 and of the International Political Science Association from 1997 to 2000.

 ''Lowi's scientific personality was a unique mix of extraordinary empirical knowledge and bold theoretical vision,'' Ilter Turan, the president of the international association, said in a statement.

 In his seminal study of liberalism -- philosophical rather than political -- Professor Lowi wrote that ''modern liberalism has left us with a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action,'' a government that ''can neither plan nor achieve justice because liberalism replaces planning with bargaining and creates a regime of policy without law.''

 He argued that special-interest politics began during the New Deal and fragmented power further with the decline of the two-party system ''to replace elected representation with interest groups as proxies for citizen participation.'' Those groups, he wrote, could paralyze government and thwart the popular will.

 Critiquing Professor Lowi's ''The Personal President'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1985, Hendrik Hertzberg praised ''The End of Liberalism'' as an ''influential and highly original work'' and summed up ''The Personal President'' this way:

 ''Mr. Lowi shrewdly describes the presidency as an increasingly 'plebiscitary' office. Its occupant uses television and polls to commune directly with the masses, bypassing such mediating institutions as Congress and the political parties. Having given our presidents big power, we expect big things of them -- especially in terms of 'service delivery,' which, Mr. Lowi writes, has displaced representation as the test of democracy and legitimacy.

 ''Despite the aggrandizement of the executive branch at Congress's expense, though, there are still 'built-in barriers to presidents' delivering on their promises,''' Mr. Hertzberg continued. ''The result is a dangerous cycle -- substantive failure, followed by frantic White House efforts to create false images of success, followed by adventurism abroad, followed by further public disillusion -- all of which forces the next president to turn the rhetorical heat up even higher.''

 Professor Lowi acerbically coined what he called the ''Law of Succession,'' which holds that each new president enhances the reputation of his predecessors. He also posed a corollary: ''This is the only certain contribution each president will make.''

 Theodore Jay Lowi was born on July 9, 1931, in Gadsden, Ala., to Alvin Lowi and the former Janice Haas.

 Israel Sergio Waismel-Manor, a lecturer at the University of Haifa in Israel and a former student of Professor Lowi's, wrote of him this month, ''He was not a religious person, but coming from the Deep South, and having played music with his mother and his siblings at the local Jewish temple, he was really an Evangelical, a preacher who followed his own apostles: Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton and V. O. Key.''

 An illness forced Mr. Lowi to drop out of Tulane University, but he recovered -- determined, he once said, someday to ''be in the history books.'' Instead, he would write them.

 He attended Michigan State University on a music scholarship (he played the oboe) and graduated in 1954. He earned a master's and a doctorate in political science from Yale.

 His first marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Angele Marie Daniel, died in 2015. In addition to their daughter, he is survived by their son, Jason; his brothers, Alvin Jr. and Bertram; and his sisters, Jan Horn and Bettie Baer.

 Professor Lowi maintained that ''political science is a harder science than the so-called hard sciences because we confront an unnatural universe that requires judgment and evaluation.''

 That was one reason he sought to expose Cornell students to practical politics with an undergraduate program for research and teaching in the nation's capital.

 His own political experience was uninspiring. In 1958, he managed the campaign of George Hawkins of Gadsden in the Democratic primary for governor of Alabama. Mr. Hawkins finished sixth in a field of 14.

 He also campaigned for Senator Eugene McCarthy in the 1968 Democratic presidential primaries and was an advocate for third-party presidential candidates, including Representative John B. Anderson, who ran and lost in 1980.

 Despite those losses, Professor Lowi's fervor was undiminished.

 ''Among the sins of omission of modern political science, the greatest of all has been the omission of passion,'' he said in a speech to the American Political Science Association when he completed his term as president.

 He did not mean the passion of ideology, he explained, but ''the pleasure of finding a pattern, the inspiration of well-rounded argument, the satisfaction of having made a good guess about what makes democracy work, and a good stab at improving the prospect of rationality in human behavior.''

 He continued: ''This is not an opportunity to play philospher-king. It is an opportunity to meet our own intellectual needs while serving the public interest. And we need not worry how to speak truth to power. It is enough to speak truth to ourselves.''","Theodore J.

2017-02-22 00:00:00,50781,"Jamie Fox, who never sought elective office but wielded political power as chief of staff or adviser to five New Jersey governors and senators and as the transportation commissioner in Democratic and Republican state administrations, died on Monday in Camden, N.J. He was 62.

 His death, at a hospital, was caused by heart failure after complications of kidney disease, his brother, Tom, said.

 Mr. Fox, a well-regarded fixture in state politics for decades, resigned from Gov. Chris Christie's cabinet in October 2015 after he was implicated in a conspiracy involving his earlier role as a lobbyist for United Airlines.

 He was charged with conspiracy to commit bribery after the airline reinstated flights to a South Carolina airport near the weekend home of David Samson, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey at the time, in exchange for concessions United had sought from the agency, which runs the metropolitan area's airports.

 Mr. Fox was accused of advising Mr. Samson to pressure United into restoring the unprofitable flights by blocking a lease for a maintenance hangar that the airline was seeking to build. The hangar was approved and United resumed the weekend flights, which Mr. Samson took 27 times. In July 2016, Mr. Samson pleaded guilty to bribery.

 The charges against Mr. Fox were still pending when he died. He had denied any wrongdoing.

 The scheme had been exposed during a federal investigation into what prosecutors said was a plot by Mr. Christie's allies at the Port Authority in 2013 to jam access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to retaliate against a mayor who had declined to endorse the governor for re-election.

 Characterizing Mr. Fox as ''one of the most outstanding public servants I have had the honor to know,'' Governor Christie said on Monday, ''Regardless of party politics, he stepped forward time and again in service to our state.''

 Trusted by politicians from both parties and adept at forging coalitions in the Legislature, Mr. Fox was credited with helping to enact the state's ban on assault weapons, overhauls of the E-ZPass system and the motor vehicles department, the preservation of the New Jersey Highlands and the groundwork for the first gasoline tax increase since 1988 to pay for improvements on roads, bridges and mass transit.

 He was the chief of staff or adviser to four governors -- Jim Florio, Jim McGreevey, Richard J. Codey and Jon S. Corzine -- and United States Senator Robert G. Torricelli. He also directed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 1999 to 2001; worked as deputy director of the Port Authority from 2004 to 2007; directed Barack Obama's successful presidential campaign in Florida in 2008; and served as transportation commissioner under Mr. McGreevey, a Democrat, and later under Mr. Christie, a Republican.

 James Patrick Fox was born on Oct. 30, 1954, in Elizabeth, N.J. His father, Edward, was personnel manager for the Burry Biscuit Company and a high school basketball coach. His mother was the former Peggy O'Connor.

 In addition to his brother, he is survived by his sisters, Judy Higgins, Jane Fox and Meg Koscheka.

 Mr. Fox's political fire was kindled when he witnessed Robert F. Kennedy's funeral train in 1968, his brother said.

2017-05-16 00:00:00,54192,"Thomas V. Daily, the bishop emeritus of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, who raised tens of millions of dollars to repair schools and churches but whose last years were marred by criticism of how he had handled the church's sexual abuse scandals in Boston and Brooklyn, died early Monday in Queens. He was 89.

 A diocesan spokeswoman announced his death, at the Immaculate Conception Center in Douglaston, where he lived at the Bishop Mugavero Residence, named after his predecessor, Francis J. Mugavero.

 Appointed by Pope John Paul II in 1990 as the sixth bishop of the diocese, which covers Brooklyn and Queens and is home to about 1.5 million Catholics, Bishop Daily presided until 2003, when the pope accepted his resignation 10 months after he was required to submit it at age 75.

 In his first news conference in 1990, Bishop Daily distinguished himself from the more liberal Bishop Mugavero, saying in response to a reporter's question that he would bar Gov. Mario M. Cuomo from speaking at parish churches in the diocese, which included Mr. Cuomo's home borough of Queens, because of his position on abortion. The governor had said he supported abortion rights and public funds for abortions for the poor while being privately opposed to abortion.

 ''I find that a contradiction, and I don't buy that,'' the bishop said. ''Politicians have to be consistent, especially when it comes to the life issue.''

 In his 13 years overseeing the diocese, Bishop Daily developed a reputation as a genial priest's bishop who forgave more than $100 million in parish debts, raised $67 million in a capital campaign and consolidated parishes.

 In 1995, he helped arrange Pope John Paul II's visit to Queens, where he celebrated Mass at Aqueduct Racetrack.

 But the bishop's legacy was clouded by criticism, coupled with his own second thoughts, about his response to lawsuits by people alleging that they were abused as minors by priests in Brooklyn and especially in Boston. Bishop Daily had been chancellor and vicar general in the Diocese of Boston under two former archbishops, Cardinal Humberto Medeiros and, briefly, Cardinal Medeiros's successor, Cardinal Bernard F. Law.

 It was Bishop Daily who allowed the Rev. John J. Geoghan on a planned two-month sabbatical to Italy before placing him back in the same parish near a family whom Father Geoghan had traumatized. Bishop Daily informed neither law enforcement nor the parish priest of the allegations against Father Geoghan, who became the country's most notorious example of a predatory priest.

 Bishop Daily was named as a defendant in dozens of suits filed by people who claimed that Father Geoghan, who was later defrocked, had molested them in his three decades as a priest. In 2002, the Boston archdiocese settled the Geoghan lawsuits for millions of dollars.

 Father Geoghan, who was accused of molesting almost 150 boys, was convicted of groping a 10-year-old boy and was serving a sentence of nine to 10 years in a Massachusetts state prison when he was strangled by another inmate in 2003.

 Asked in a deposition why he never investigated whether Father Geoghan had molested children beyond those of a family he had met with in 1982, Bishop Daily replied: ''I'm not a policeman. I am a shepherd. I am a pastor who has to go after the Lord's sheep and find them and bring them back to the fold and give them the kind of guidance and discipline them in such a way that they will come back.''

 James M. O'Toole, a history professor at Boston College, said of Bishop Daily by email that ''without excusing anything that he did or did not do, it seems to me that at some level he simply did not know what to do.''

 ''Should Daily have done more?'' Mr. O'Toole continued. ''Obviously. But there was something in the way that he and other priests of his generation had been trained that prevented them from recognizing the larger patterns of abuse.

 ''Each case seems to have been handled individually. Only later did the full, systemic dimensions of abuse become clear to everyone. For that reason, though there was surely culpability on his part and that of other bishops, there was for me also a kind of sadness to it -- that a fundamentally good man did such a tragically poor job in addressing this issue.''

 Thomas Vose Daily was born on Sept. 23, 1927, in Belmont, Mass., a Boston suburb, to John Daily, an official of the Knights of Columbus, and the former Mary McBride.

 He graduated from Boston College and St. John's Seminary in Brighton, Mass., and was ordained as a priest in 1952. (His brother became a priest, too.)

 In the 1960s, he spent five years in Peru with the Missionary Society of St. James the Apostle, becoming proficient in Spanish, before returning to Boston, where he was consecrated as an auxiliary bishop and appointed vicar general of the archdiocese.

 In 1984, he was installed as the first bishop of the Diocese of Palm Beach, Fla. He also served as the supreme chaplain of the Knights of Columbus.

 In response to the sexual abuse scandals, many revealed by The Boston Globe's Spotlight Team, the subject of an Oscar-winning 2015 film, Bishop Daily said he regretted some of his actions but argued that he had been following procedures generally accepted at the time. When he resigned, he acknowledged that the scandal had brought sleepless nights.

 ''Some people carry heavy, heavy crosses,'' he said. ''They do it in union with Jesus Christ. For what? For life. They hold it for life everlasting.''

 The bishop said, though, that he preferred to focus for the moment on the people of Brooklyn.

 ''The greatest treasure that Brooklyn has is its people, good people,'' he said. ''I know that in the streets of Brooklyn you can find evil. You pick up the papers, and you can see it. But I've got to tell you, there are saints walking the streets of Brooklyn.''

2017-01-01 00:00:00,50595,"F. Ross Johnson, who as chief executive of RJR Nabisco instigated an era-defining takeover struggle that was chronicled in film and a best-selling book and made him to many a symbol of corporate greed, died on Thursday at his home in Jupiter, Fla. He was 85.

 The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for his family said.

 Noted for lavish expense account spending and for surrounding himself with sports stars and other celebrities, Mr. Johnson cut the biggest profile among a breed of executives who with little company loyalty waged war on the traditional business order in the financial world's roaring 1980s.

 ''He did the biggest deals, had the biggest mouth and enjoyed the biggest perks,'' Bryan Burrough and John Helyar wrote in ''Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco,'' a detailed 1990 examination of Mr. Johnson's signature gamble.

 The auction of RJR Nabisco, a white-hot, debt-fueled competition that Mr. Johnson's management group lost in October and November 1988, became the biggest corporate takeover to that point. It began as by far the most ambitious leveraged buyout ever attempted and resulted in a $25 billion victory by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.

 But the deal, which cost Mr. Johnson his company and much of his career and reputation, left him with few regrets in his retirement in Florida and even some satisfaction as having been the leading figure in an epic American business story, one that is still taught in business schools.

 ''The whole deal had an impact on millions of readers, in terms of their knowledge of business,'' he told the ''Barbarians at the Gate'' authors in an epilogue to their book. ''Between the book and the movie, everyone knows who the hell you are. I mean, it's been 20 years! But people, they think you're a star.''

 James Garner played Mr. Johnson in the 1993 HBO film about the deal.

 Frederick Ross Johnson was born on Dec. 13, 1931, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the only child of a hardware salesman and a bookkeeper. He was entrepreneurial as a child -- he rented his comic book collection to friends and at 7 won a bicycle for selling magazine subscriptions -- but an indifferent student. Still, he managed to graduate from the University of Manitoba with a degree in commerce.

 His career started slowly, first as an accountant for General Electric in Montreal, then with a sales position in Toronto, where he took friends to what he called ''the good parties'' while deploying expense budgets to entertain customers extravagantly.

 But he had made little corporate headway by age 32, and when he failed to get a transfer to the United States he left G.E. for T. Eaton, a venerable Canadian department store chain. From there, he landed the No. 2 job at General Steel Works, a maker of small appliances.

 His breakthrough came when he was presented with the chance to head the Montreal-based Canadian subsidiary of Standard Brands, a stodgy operation that included Chase & Sanborn coffee. He fired 21 of the top 23 executives in his first year and led a revival that won him a promotion to head the company's international operations in New York.

 Before long, the board had made him president and then, in a 1976 coup, chief executive.

 Mr. Johnson promptly transformed Standard Brands management, lavishing on his executives industry-topping salaries, country-club memberships, apartments and a private box at Madison Square Garden. The team was a raucous, profane, fraternity-like group that would go out after business hours to dine and drink, repairing afterward to a new company-owned apartment.

 ''When most other Fortune 500 executives were long asleep,'' Mr. Burrough and Mr. Helyar wrote, ''Johnson's band would change into rumpled sweatsuits and settle back for a long night of drinking, talking business and kicking around ideas. By the wee hours, those still conscious would collapse into the twin beds in the two bedrooms or onto the living-room couch.''

 Never one to cut costs, Mr. Johnson saw profits suddenly plummet by nearly 50 percent because of a price collapse in the Standard Brands corn-sweetener business. The crisis prompted the onetime accountant to engage in some financial sleight-of-hand and to introduce new products, including the Reggie! Bar, a candy named for his New York Yankees pal Reggie Jackson, and a wine called French Kiss. Both proved ill-fated.

 In 1981, a restive Mr. Johnson negotiated a $1.9 billion stock swap with the packaged-food juggernaut Nabisco, maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers. Fortune magazine likened the combination to the Hell's Angels merging with the Rotary Club, but its harmonious success and the early retirement of the chief executive lifted Mr. Johnson to the top job in 1984.

 The following spring Mr. Johnson got a call from J. Tylee Wilson, head of R. J. Reynolds Industries, whose brands included Winston and Salem cigarettes, Smirnoff vodka and Hawaiian Punch. Mr. Wilson proposed a friendly $4.9 billion takeover, which resulted in RJR Nabisco.

 Within months, Mr. Johnson had asked the board to choose between him and Mr. Wilson, and for the second time in five years he saw his company bought out by a larger one only to emerge once again as the boss.

 ''Ross is a locomotive,'' one company executive told Business Week, ''and Wilson just got out of his way.''

 Mr. Johnson, shaggy-haired and fond of gold necklaces and open-collar shirts, promptly slashed the corporate staff by two-thirds and, to vitriolic backlash, moved headquarters to Atlanta from Winston-Salem, N.C., where it had been rooted for more than a century.

 He also oversaw construction of what Mr. Burrough and Mr. Helyar described as the ''Taj Mahal'' of hangars for RJR's expanded ''air force'' of 10 planes and a separate building from which the company's 36 corporate pilots ferried celebrity friends like Jack Nicklaus and Frank Gifford. Mr. Gifford, as a sportscaster, would hitch rides home from televising football games.

 Mr. Johnson relished his lush job, but he soon grew restless again. Unhappy with RJR's languishing stock price, which was depressed by mounting public concern about the health hazards of tobacco, he assembled a group of eight company managers and told a shocked board that they wanted to buy the food and tobacco conglomerate themselves.

 Although their offer of $75 a share was about $20 above the market value at the time, it was shown to be a lowball figure when Kohlberg Kravis Roberts joined the fray four days later with an offer of $90.

 ''It made K.K.R. look like saviors,'' someone involved in the process told The New York Times when the dust had settled. ''It started to create a feeling of 'what's going on here with the management?'''

 A public relations bombshell went off when The Times disclosed a financial arrangement under which Mr. Johnson and a small number of his executives could each reap profits topping $100 million. When he responded that it was not unusual for a buyout group to be rewarded with 20 percent of the company, the criticism intensified.

 The deal was ''a startling example of the conflict of interest a chief executive faces when he participates in a buyout on both the buy side, trying to get the best terms for himself, and the sell side, representing the shareholders,'' wrote Business Week.

 The bidding escalated in an increasingly tense six weeks: to $92 a share, then $94, $101, $106, $108 and $112. The board finally awarded the deal to K.K.R. at $109 a share, or $24.88 billion.

 Mr. Johnson conceded that his rival's bid was better than his group's $112, and he resigned as chief executive three months later with a severance package worth around $50 million. RJR Nabisco was subsequently dismembered.

 He is survived by his wife Susan; two sons, Neil and Bruce; and two granddaughters.","F.

2017-08-26 00:00:00,33451,"Cecil D. Andrus, a four-term governor of Idaho who as interior secretary under President Jimmy Carter helped set aside vast expanses of Alaska for parks and reserves, died on Thursday at his home in Boise, Idaho. He was 85.

 The cause was complications of lung cancer, his daughter Tracy Andrus said.

 Mr. Andrus liked to portray himself as having stumbled into public life -- he was a ''political accident,'' in his words. It was a sophisticated bit of self-branding, positioning him as passionate rather than opportunistic in a state where the notion of Western authenticity had always played well.

 He was 28 in 1960 when his tiny community of Orofino, Idaho, invited the area's aging Republican state senator to a town meeting to try to persuade him to fight for more financing for a public kindergarten.

 ''He made the statement, 'Well, this school system was good enough for me, it's good enough for your kids,' '' Mr. Andrus, a Democrat, recalled in an interview for this obituary in 2012. ''I couldn't help myself. I said, 'It's pretty obvious, Senator, that the school system wasn't even good enough for you.' ''

 That exchange prompted laughter, and it helped propel Mr. Andrus to run for the same State Senate seat. He won it that fall, and a decade later became governor, the first Democrat elected to that post in 24 years.

 He also may have been the first governor of either party to win by running on an environmental issue. His opposition to a proposed molybdenum mine in the White Cloud Mountains of central Idaho was at the core of his campaign. The mine was never built, and Mr. Andrus cruised to re-election in 1974.

 Halfway into his second term he received a call from another rural Democrat, Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia. They had become friends over the years while attending meetings of governors' groups.

 ''We got along very well,'' Mr. Andrus said, ''because both of us understood the need for protection of the land that the dear lord has provided to us.''

 Mr. Carter had just been elected president and had Mr. Andrus in mind for secretary of the interior. ''Cece was the only person I considered for the cabinet post,'' Mr. Carter said in a statement on Friday.

 The call came in around 6 p.m. By the next morning, after hopping a short flight to Seattle, a red-eye to Atlanta and, finally, a tiny Cessna to an unpaved landing strip in Plains, Ga., Mr. Andrus was shaking hands with his future boss.

 ''I come from the old school that says when the president of the United States asks you to do something, you do it,'' Mr. Andrus said.

 Mr. Andrus never liked Washington, but he believed in his work. Over the next four years he helped reduce the impact of mining in Appalachia and protected rivers in California. But his most notable work happened in Alaska, which had been admitted to the union just 17 years before Mr. Carter was elected.

 ''We developed America by giving away resources,'' Mr. Andrus said in the interview. ''When we got to the Pacific Ocean, we looked back over our shoulders and said, 'Oh, my God, look what we've done.' But in Alaska we had the opportunity to do it right the first time.''

 With Mr. Andrus leading the way, the Carter administration set aside more than 100 million acres in the state for federal protection, including what became the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The measure was completed in a lame-duck session of Congress in the final weeks of the Carter administration, after Ronald Reagan had won the 1980 election, denying the president a second term.

 The plan drew intense criticism from many Alaskans and industries that wanted more freedom to develop the state's oil, mineral, timber and other resources. It also frustrated environmentalists, who wanted the protections to go further.

 ''After review of all the exceptions, some critics wondered that it was called a conservation act at all,'' the Alaska historian Stephen Haycox wrote in his book ''Frigid Embrace: Politics, Economics and Environment in Alaska'' (2002). ''But most recognized that it did provide a framework for preservation in Alaska.''

 Mr. Andrus acknowledged the imperfections but said that environmentalists would have fared much worse if they had waited for Reagan to take office.

 ''Even though we were creating tomorrow's controversies, a 103-million-acre plan -- amounting to more than 25 percent of Alaska -- was a helluva lot better than nothing,'' he said in his 1998 memoir, ''Cecil Andrus: Politics Western Style,'' which he wrote with Joel Connelly, a Seattle journalist.

 Mr. Carter saw the Alaska legislation as one of his biggest accomplishments. ''Together we made conservation history,'' he said in his statement about Mr. Andrus on Friday. ''Americans are better off because of his service,'' he added, ''and I am better because of his friendship.''

 Mr. Andrus returned to Idaho soon after Mr. Carter left office in 1981. Asked in interviews before he left whether he might stay in the nation's capital, he wore his Western pride openly.

 ''The only reason so many people live on the East Coast is that they don't know any better,'' he said.

 Back in Boise, he caught some people off guard by becoming a spokesman for the aluminum industry, which relied on the region's hydroelectric dams for cheap power. Mr. Andrus had been a longtime critic of the dams' effect on migrating salmon, but he also believed a balance could be achieved that preserved the dams, industry and the fish.

 Years later, however, that balance has proved elusive, as fish populations continue to suffer and advocates on various sides continue to fight in court.

 Mr. Andrus also surprised people when he decided to run for governor again in 1986. He won by just 3,500 votes. His popularity would steadily rise, and he was re-elected with more than 70 percent of the vote in 1990.

 In 1988, during a dispute with the federal government over the storage of nuclear waste in Idaho, he won new supporters when he ordered state troopers to block a railroad car filled with nuclear waste from entering a storage site. Two years later he confounded some supporters when he vetoed a bill that would have given Idaho one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the nation. Once again he appealed to his state's independent streak.

 ''We Idahoans are a fiercely independent group,'' Mr. Andrus said at the time. ''We call them as we see them, and I have done that. I know there will be some fallout. I can't do anything about that.''

 The Legislature, which included an evenly divided Senate and a Republican-controlled House, upheld his veto of the anti-abortion bill. Of more than 100 vetoes he issued while in office, lawmakers overturned just one.

 Mr. Andrus did not seek another term in 1994. Idaho has not had a Democratic governor since, and its Legislature has long since become dominated by Republicans.

 Later in life, Mr. Andrus lamented what he described as increasing partisanship in the state and the nation.

 ''We used to be able to work in the middle,'' he said in 2012, ''but there is no middle anymore.''

 Cecil Dale Andrus was born on Aug. 25, 1931 -- he died a day before his 86th birthday -- in Hood River, Ore. He grew up fishing for salmon with his father, Hal, who worked in the timber industry, and he could recall watching Native Americans fish at Celilo Falls, the famous rapids on the Columbia River that were permanently submerged when dams were built in the 1950s. His mother, the former Dorothy Johnson, was a homemaker.

 He graduated from high school in Eugene, Ore., before enrolling in Oregon State College (now Oregon State University). He served in the Korean War, flying with a patrol bomber squadron.

 In 1949 Mr. Andrus married his high school sweetheart, Carol May, who survives him. Looking for work, the family moved to Orofino, where his father helped him find a job in a timber mill.

 In addition to his wife and his daughter Tracy, Mr. Andrus is survived by two other daughters, Tana Andrus-Watson and Kelly Andrus; a brother, Steve; a sister, Margaret Gardner; three grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.

 Mr. Andrus avoided many of the trappings of being governor. He lived in his own house, mowed his lawn himself, and had limited security. But he was, by all accounts, a deft politician -- and one who kept score.

 When he ran for governor in 1986, the state's Republican senators signed a large advertisement in The Idaho Statesman saying they opposed his election. Mr. Andrus kept a copy of the ad in his desk at the Capitol, and he enjoyed pulling it out when a Republican lawmaker would come in trying to win his support for a bill.

 ''If you had legislation you wanted and you were on that list,'' recalled Bruce Newcomb, who was the Republican majority leader at the end of Mr. Andrus's final term and later became House speaker, ''well, you had an uphill battle.''","Cecil D.
