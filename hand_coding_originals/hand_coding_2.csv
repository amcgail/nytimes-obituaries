24585,"DOLORES DEL RIO, 77, IS DEAD; FILM STAR IN U.S. AND MEXICO","Dolores Del Rio, an actress of remarkable beauty who became a film star in Hollywood and in her native Mexico, died Monday at her home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 77 years old and had been in failing health.","Dolores Del Rio, an actress of remarkable beauty who became a film star in Hollywood and in her native Mexico, died Monday at her home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 77 years old and had been in failing health. During the days of silent films, Miss Del Rio's face, elegant and expressive, made her one of Hollywood's important actresses and one of its first Latin stars. Her first big movie was ''What Price Glory,'' the landmark film directed by Raoul Walsh in 1926, in which she portrayed a French peasant. Her first starring role was a portrayal of a Russian girl in ''Resurrection'' in 1927. Her next starring role came in 1928 in ''Ramona,'' the tragic story of a beauty of Spanish and Indian extraction. Of ''Ramona,'' Mordaunt Hall wrote in The New York Times: ''Miss Del Rio's interpretation of Romona is an achievment. Not once does she overact, and yet she is perceived weeping and almost hysterical. She is most careful in all the moods of the character. Her beauty is another point in her favor.'' Not a Spanish Actress In Miss Del Rio's first appearance on film, in ''Joanna'' in 1925, she was billed as a ''Spanish actress,'' a label that was changed to ''Mexican'' only at her insistence. The director Edwin Carewe, who discovered her, said that he wanted to avoid her being typecast. But ultimately, her career in the United States suffered because producers invariably cast her in ethnic and exotic roles. During the late 1920's and early 1930's, there was a spate of such films that included ''Girl of the Rio,'' ''Revenge,'' ''Bird of Paradise'' and ''Loves of Carmen.'' Of her role in ''Carmen,'' Mordaunt Hall wrote: ''The alluring Miss Del Rio, with her bright eyes, pretty lips and lithe figure, gives a decidedly unrestrained portrait of the faithless creature.'' With the advent of talking pictures, Miss Del Rio's Latin accent hemmed her into such roles even more, although she was able to sustain an acceptable level of popularity in Hollywood through the early 1940's. Returned to Mexico In 1933, she introduced the two-piece swimsuit in ''Flying Down to Rio,'' in which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers teamed up for the first time. In the movie, Miss Del Rio and Mr. Astaire danced, in a memorable scene, to '' Orchids In the Moonlight.'' In 1934, in ''Wonder Bar,'' Al Jolson and Dick Powell competed for her affections. That same year she played the title role in ''Madame Du Barry,'' the fetching mistress of Louis XV. In 1943, after tiring of her glamour-girl image in Hollywood, Miss Del Rio returned to Mexico, where she enjoyed a much more rewarding career on screen and stage, and helped establish the Mexican film industry. ''Maria Candelaria,'' the film of which she was said to be proudest, was one of the earliest serious movies made in Mexico. The Spanish-language film won the best picture award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1946. In it, she played an Indian peasant woman who is stoned to death by villagers because they believe she has modeled for a famous nude painting, though actually, she modeled only for the face. The film was directed by Emilio Fernandez. One of her best-known roles was in the John Ford film ''The Fugitive,'' made in Mexico in 1947. In it, she played an unwed Indian mother who aided a fugitive priest, played by Henry Fonda. In the 1960's, she returned to Hollywood to star in ''Flaming Star,'' ''Cheyenne Autumn'' and ''The Children of Sanchez,'' an American-Mexican production. Daughter of a Banker Miss Del Rio was born Lolita Dolores Martinez Asunsolo Lopez Negrette, the daughter of a banker. She was educated in a convent school? In 1925, Mr. Carewe saw her at a dance in Mexico City and suggested that she had a future in movies. She was married three times, the first time at age 15 to Jaime Del Rio. The marriage ended before her career in Hollywood began. Her marriage in 1930 to the director Cedric Gibbons ended in divorce 11 years later, and she married Lewis Riley, a producer, who was with her when she died."

34886,"Aileen Ward, Author of Award-Winning Keats Biography, Dies at 97","Professor Ward spent nine years researching ""John Keats: The Making of a Poet,"" which won the National Book Award in 1964.","Professor Ward spent nine years researching ""John Keats: The Making of a Poet,"" which won the National Book Award in 1964. Aileen Ward, a scholar whose sympathetic, insightful biography of the Romantic poet John Keats won a National Book Award in 1964, died on May 31 in her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 97. The death was confirmed by her nephew Alex Ward. Professor Ward spent nine years researching ""John Keats: The Making of a Poet,"" the first major account of his life since the publication of Amy Lowell's two-volume ""Keats"" in 1925. Her aim was twofold: to critically analyze Keats's poetry and, by reading his inner life, to explain what she called his ""audacious act of self-creation."" In conferring the prize, the administrators of the National Book Award praised the biography as a ""searching and perceptive reappraisal of a major literary figure,"" calling it an ""honest, moving, and beautifully balanced work - a truly distinguished portrait."" As is happened, Professor Ward prevailed over a mighty rival, the Harvard literary historian Walter Jackson Bate, who came out with his own Keats biography a few months after Professor Ward's, to admiring reviews and, eventually, a Pulitzer Prize. It, too, was in the running for the National Book Award - seemingly a David-and-Goliath contest in terms of the authors' reputations - but the readability and psychological acumen of Professor Ward's version won the day. ""The question Bate leaves unexplained is what made the man become the poet,"" Philip C. Rule wrote in ""Seeing Into the Life of Things: Essays on Religion and Literature"" (1997), edited by John L. Mahoney. ""This is precisely the question that Aileen Ward sets out to answer."" Professor Ward was doubly honored when she won the Duff Cooper Memorial Prize in Britain for her biography. She was both the first American and the first woman to win that prize. ""As Allen Tate was the first to say, Keats is one of the real heroes of literature,"" she said when receiving the National Book Award. ""There is hardly another life we know of that speaks so eloquently of the daring, the energy and dedication that are required for great achievement as a writer."" Aileen Coursen Ward was born on April 1, 1919, in Newark and grew up in Summit, N.J. Her father, Waldron, was a lawyer; her mother was the former Aline Coursen. After earning a B.A. in English from Smith College in 1940, she enrolled in Radcliffe, where she was awarded an M.A. in 1942 and a doctoral degree in 1953, with a dissertation on poetic metaphor. Professor Ward taught at Wellesley and Barnard before joining the Vassar English department in 1954. She later taught at Sarah Lawrence, Brandeis and New York University. She retired in 1990. While at Wellesley, she struck up a friendship with Vladimir Nabokov, who was teaching Russian there. To cope with wartime gasoline rationing, the college organized car pools for commuters, and she and Nabokov shared a car that took them to their homes in Cambridge. In an interview with Brian Boyd, the author of ""Vladimir Nabokov: The American Years,"" Professor Ward recalled that she and Nabokov would pass the time by making up parodies of poems by Thomas Hardy, A. E. Housman and other poets. When Nabokov was trying to find someone to replace him when he left Cornell, shortly after the publication of ""Lolita,"" it was she who came up with a successful recommendation, the novelist Herbert Gold. Professor Ward wrote introductions to editions of William Blake and Thomas De Quincey and edited a collection of Keats's poems. She served for many years on the board of Yaddo, the writers' retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. She leaves no immediate survivors. Her longtime partner, Nancy Cardozo, died in 2014. At her death, Professor Ward had been at work for a half-century on a biography of Blake. ""The commitment is like climbing up to the top of a high diving board,"" she told Booklist in 2003. ""There is only one way to get down again that you can contemplate."""

22835,"Myer Shark, 94, Lawyer Who Fought Utility","Myer Shark, a Minnesota consumer lawyer whose last case sought to recover $300 million of taxes that electric customers paid a utility but that federal and state governments never received, died yesterday in a suburb of Minneapolis, days after filing the final papers in the case.","Myer Shark, a Minnesota consumer lawyer whose last case sought to recover $300 million of taxes that electric customers paid a utility but that federal and state governments never received, died yesterday in a suburb of Minneapolis, days after filing the final papers in the case. He was 94. His death was announced by a daughter, Janet Frisch. He died at a hospice in St. Louis Park, Minn. The taxes Mr. Shark sought were embedded in the electric rates paid by customers of Xcel Energy's Minnesota electric utility. The government did not get the money because a sister company went bankrupt, generating a huge tax refund for Xcel. Mr. Shark's pursuit of the case inspired investigations and hearings in at least four other states. ''The law says utilities are entitled to just and reasonable returns,'' Mr. Shark said three weeks ago. ''When the utility pockets money that they got from ratepayers, money that was supposed to pay taxes, then they are earning unjust and unreasonable rates and I'm going to fight that as long as I'm alive.'' Ron Giteck, an assistant Minnesota attorney general, said that in the weeks before he died, Mr. Shark ''filed everything that needed to be filed so the case can be decided'' by the Minnesota Court of Appeals. Last week the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission awarded Mr. Shark $20,000, the maximum allowed under state law, for his pursuit of the tax case on behalf of ratepayers. In an era when lawyer fees in a case can run into the tens of millions of dollars, Mr. Shark had asked for $160 an hour plus $437 in expenses, for a total of $30,000. Xcel opposed any payment. Mr. Shark was born in Devils Lake, N.D., and graduated from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1936. In addition to his daughter Janet, of Golden Valley, Minn., he is survived by his wife of 67 years, Marjorie, of St. Louis Park, Minn.; another daughter, Miriam Shark of Baltimore; two sons, Bud, of Lyons, Colo., and Steve, of Fargo, N.D.; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. While he was a fierce opponent in rate cases, Mr. Shark often answered his phone whimsically, saying ''you have reached your friendly Shark.''"

He was 81. The cause was heart failure, Mr. Newton's son, Nigel, said. A successful businessman before becoming a winemaker in the 1960s, Mr. Newton was part of the first wave of vintners who helped turn Napa into a premier winemaking region. With Michael Stone, he founded Sterling Vineyards near Calistoga, Calif., in 1964. Sterling released its first vintage in 1969 and soon became known for its cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay. Mr. Newton was also known as one of the first winemakers in the region to plant merlot. (At the time, most Napa vintners regarded the merlot grape as too temperamental to be worth the trouble.) The winery was considered among the most beautiful in the world. Modeled on a Greek monastery, it was set atop a hillside and reached by an aerial tram. Its three bell towers were hung with bells from St. Dunstan-in-the-East in London, which had been destroyed in World War II. Sterling Vineyards was sold to Coca-Cola in 1977 and was later sold to Seagram. It is now owned by Diageo Chateau & Estate Wines. In 1977, Mr. Newton and his wife, Su Hua, founded Newton Vineyard in St. Helena. Its chardonnays and merlots -- most of them unfiltered, barrel aged and fermented with natural local yeasts -- were regularly praised by critics for their subtlety, finesse and depth of flavor. In 1998, President Bill Clinton and the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, served a 1995 Newton chardonnay at a White House dinner honoring Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. Peter Leigh Newton was born in London on Aug. 27, 1926; the family moved to Sussex during the London blitz. Mr. Newton earned a law degree from Oxford and later became a journalist with The Financial Times. In 1950, he moved to San Francisco as the newspaper's West Coast correspondent. The next year, he started Sterling International, a paper trading and manufacturing concern. Mr. Newton's first wife, the former Anne St. Aubyn, whom he married in 1951, died in 1970. His second marriage, to Su Hua Lim, ended in divorce. He is survived by three children from his first marriage, Carol Boone of San Francisco; Gail Showley of St. Helena; and Nigel, of London; a brother, Kenneth, of South Fawley, Oxfordshire, England; and six grandchildren. In 2001, the luxury-goods company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought a majority share in Newton Vineyard."

Edward James McCarthy, an Augustinian friar who was president of three colleges and was briefly held in a Cuban lockup during five decades in higher education, died on Monday at St. Thomas Monastery, a residence on the campus of Villanova University in Villanova, Pa.","The Rev. Edward James McCarthy, an Augustinian friar who was president of three colleges and was briefly held in a Cuban lockup during five decades in higher education, died on Monday at St. Thomas Monastery, a residence on the campus of Villanova University in Villanova, Pa. He was 84 and until last month resided at the Augustinian Monastery at St. Thomas University in Miami. The cause was respiratory failure, according to St. Thomas University, the Archdiocesan Catholic University of Florida, which he served as interim president in 1993-94. Father McCarthy was born in Troy, N.Y., and graduated in philosophy in 1934 from what was then Villanova College. He studied theology at Augustinian College in Washington and earned a Ph.D. in history across the street at Catholic University in 1939. He was ordained a priest in 1937. He held a number of positions at Villanova before his order posted him to Cuba in 1946 when it established the Universidad de Santo Tomas de Villanueva in Havana. He returned to Villanova two years later as dean of arts and sciences. It was back to Havana in 1957 as vice president of academic affairs until the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of April 1961. The Cuban Government padlocked Villanueva, and Father McCarthy was taken away at gunpoint. Along with others caught in the middle, he was held for 11 days at a makeshift detention center. He was then allowed to take refuge in the Swiss Embassy pending his expulsion from Cuba weeks later. When he arrived in Miami, the archdiocese there asked him to establish Biscayne College, and he was its president from 1961 to 1968. The college added a graduate program and law school and became St. Thomas University in 1984. Father McCarthy was president of Villanova from 1971 to 1975. At his death he was president emeritus of St. Thomas and a university trustee. He previously served as chairman of the Villanova board. He is survived by two sisters, Kathleen Warnock of Troy and Mildred Riely of Naples, Fla."

Kartell, who as a Justice of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn ruled in favor of women bus drivers in a 1981 discrimination case, died on Saturday at Mary Immaculate Nursing Home in Lawrence, Mass. He was 86 and moved to Lawrence from Brooklyn three years ago. The cause was prostate cancer, said Harvey Goldman of the Goldman Fisher Funeral Chapel in Malden, Mass. Justice Kartell, a Democrat, was elected to the Supreme Court in 1971 and retired in 1983. He sat on the Civil Court from 1967 to 1971 and the Municipal Court from 1957 to 1967. The judge's 1981 ruling came after Robert Abrams, the State Attorney General, brought a suit on behalf of the 30 women who drove buses for the Transit Authority at the time. The women drivers contended that the authority's promotion of 30 men from bus driver to dispatcher, on the basis of a seniority list, was unfair to the women, who were relatively new on the driver force. In 1981, there were about 9,000 bus drivers in the city. Most of the 30 women among them had been hired after a minimum height requirement of 5 feet 4 inches was dropped in 1976. The judge ruled that the authority must make promotions based on merit, not seniority. He ordered the authority to hold Civil Service tests for the dispatcher jobs. Irving Philip Kartell was born in Brooklyn and earned his law degree from St. John's University. He practiced law in Brooklyn and was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1947 to 1953. His wife of 55 years, the former Leonore Sweedler, died in 1990. The judge is survived by a son, Dr. James P., of Andover, Mass.; a daughter, Karren Jacobson Cowl of Baltimore, and a grandchild."

12825,"Robert Schwartz, 88, Broker And Promoter of Social Causes","Robert J. Schwartz, a stockbroker who was an early advocate of using investment choices to foster social change and environmental awareness, died May 9 in Manhattan.","Robert J. Schwartz, a stockbroker who was an early advocate of using investment choices to foster social change and environmental awareness, died May 9 in Manhattan. He was 88. The cause was heart failure, his grandson, Mathew Schwartz, said. ''Bob was the grandfather of socially responsible investing,'' said John Harrington, the founder of Working Assets, a group of mutual funds that back companies that adhere to its political principles. ''He advocated that you could be a prudent investor and still take social and human rights issues into account when you made investment decisions.'' Mr. Schwartz began his campaign for principled investing in the 1950's when he left a job with the Treasury Department and went to work for the Amalgamated Bank in New York. While at Bache & Company and what became Shearson Lehman Hutton, Mr. Schwartz worked as a stockbroker helping union and church funds invest in ways consistent with their values. In 1983, while at Shearson, he started the Trust for Balanced Investment, a nutual fund that was to invest in companies that demonstrated commitment to workers' rights, environmental protection and other social aims. Leonard Woodcock, the former president of the United Automobile Workers union, agreed to serve as the fund's chairman. Shearson required that Mr. Schwartz raise $75 million in investments for the fund to be introduced, but before he could achieve that goal, the project was canceled by executives at American Express, which had acquired Shearson. Mr. Schwartz retired from Shearson in 1989 but continued to work at the firm part time investing money for some longtime clients. After earning a bachelor's degree in economics from City College and a master's in the same field from Columbia, Mr. Schwartz joined the Treasury Department in 1941 in the office of Foreign Funds Control, working on Puerto Rico. He joined the United States Marine Corps in 1944 and near the end of World War II, he served on the staff of the Marine Corps Air Command for the Okinawa campaign. In 1947, he returned to the Treasury Department, serving as the chief of the international statistics division. But he was forced to leave, his grandson said, as McCarthy-era politics made his political views unwelcome. ''He was not a communist, but he was what a lot of people would call a fellow traveler,'' Mathew Schwartz said. In 1988 he founded the organization that became Economists Allied for Arms Reduction, which sought to document the economic costs of military activities. The group is now called Economists for Peace and Security. He was also active in Peace Action for a Sane World, a disarmament organization. Mr. Schwartz was married twice, first to Beatrice Ross Schwartz, and then to Josephine Martin, a psychiatrist active in human rights campaigns. Ms. Martin died in 2000 and Ms. Schwartz died in 2002. He is survived by three grandchildren and one great-grandson. Mr. Schwartz was an early opponent of the Vietnam War. In 1966, he ran unsuccessfully on an antiwar platform for the Democratic nomination for the seat in New York's 17th Congressional district, which was vacated by John V. Lindsay when he was elected mayor. Mr. Schwartz helped organize protests against Dow Chemical, the producer of napalm, and he organized a group called Wall Street Executives Against the War. ''Initial attitudes on Wall Street ranged from unfriendly to hostile,'' Mr. Schwartz wrote. ''Not only was I opposed to the Vietnam War, but I was also opposed to the very profitable war industries. Mr. Schwartz, who had the backing of Shearson's powerful chief Sanford I. Weill, reveled in the controversy. ''I was considered a maverick of Wall Street (a designation I enjoyed),'' he wrote."

Obletz, a dance-company manager and railroad buff who lived aboard two dining cars parked behind Pennsylvania Station in the 1970's and 80's, died on April 23 at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. He was 50 and lived in Manhattan. The cause was cancer, said Ruth Moore, an assistant to his lawyer. Mr. Obletz, who graduated from Hamilton College in 1967 and Yale School of Drama in 1972, was trained as an arts administrator. He managed the Alwin Nikolai and Murray Louis dance companies in the 1970's and, as a director of a Unesco agency, organized conferences on dance copyright issues and the social welfare of dancers. In the 1980's, he was the chairman of Community Board 4 on the West Side of Manhattan and the chairman of its transportation committee. He was also a consultant to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the subway and rail lines it runs. But above all, he was a rail buff. In the 1970's, he bought an Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway dormitory diner, a car with tables for passengers and bunks for the cooks and waiters, that had been in service since the 1940's. He coupled it to a leased rail car from the old New York Central that had been half of a ""twin-unit diner,"" made for long cross-country trains. Mr. Obletz got the dining half, with its stainless steel walls, Formica tables and leathery banquettes. (The half he did not get was the kitchen.) He parked the two cars on part of a track behind Penn Station, the site above which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has proposed building a new Yankee Stadium. Hauling his half of the twin-unit car into its space was a two-day adventure. The car had been in storage in Lebanon, N.J., but to get it across the Hudson River, Mr. Obletz had to have it pulled to Albany and back to Manhattan. In 1982, he ventured onto a section of abandoned elevated rail line that had once run from the old Washington Market in lower Manhattan to Spuyten Duyvil at the northern end of the island. The line once carried freight cars loaded with produce, meat, fabrics and newsprint to wholesale markets and factories in Harlem and the West Side, but it carried its last train -- three box-cars of frozen turkeys -- in April 1980. Mr. Obletz bought a two-mile section of the line through Chelsea from Conrail for $10. He figured that for about $250,000, he could lease a locomotive and some second-hand parlor cars and carry tourists, commuters and park-and-ride visitors to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which was under construction then. To bring the line back to life, he set up the West Side Rail Line Development Foundation. But the blare of train whistles and the rumbling of locomotives were never heard. After five years in various courts, fighting the state, the city and property owners along the line who wanted the line demolished, he turned the tracks back to Conrail. He is survived by his companion, Greg Jones; his parents, Bernard and Louise Obletz of Buffalo; his grandmother, Rose Obletz of Buffalo; three brothers, Stephen, of Buffalo, Thomas, of San Rafael, Calif., and Douglas, of Portland, Ore.; a sister, Betty Jones of Portland, Maine, and 13 nephews and nieces."

He was 79 years old. He died of congestive heart failure, said his physician, Dr. Leonard Schwartzman. Mr. Brooks was known for hard-hitting dramatic films that sometimes addressed social themes, and for his skillful adaptation of literary material for the screen. 'It All Has to Do With a Story' In an interview late in his career he said he thought of himself as a writer first and foremost. ""Directing is only writing with a camera,"" he said. ""Editing is writing. Scoring is writing. It all has to do with a story, how to tell a story."" Mr. Brooks was born in Philadelphia and attended Temple University. After working as a sports reporter for The Philadelphia Record, he became a news writer, announcer and commentator for NBC radio in New York. In 1940, he moved to Los Angeles, where he wrote for radio and began collaborating on screenplays for such B films as ""White Savage"" (1943) and ""Cobra Woman"" (1944). After serving in the Marine Corps during World War II, he returned to screenwriting, collaborating on ""Key Largo"" (1948), starring Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson. In 1950, he directed his first film, ""Crisis,"" a political thriller starring Cary Grant and Jose Ferrer and the first of many films he made for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer before becoming an independent producer in 1965. In 1952, he directed ""Deadline U.S.A.,"" a taut drama starring Humphrey Bogart as a reporter. The film that established Mr. Brooks as a directing talent was ""The Blackboard Jungle"" (1955), a powerful drama about violence in an American high school. The screenplay, which he co-wrote, was nominated for an Academy Award. In 1960, Mr. Brooks received an Academy Award for his screenplay for ""Elmer Gantry,"" which starred Burt Lancaster as a fast-talking tent preacher. The same year, he married Jean Simmons, Mr. Lancaster's co-star in the film. He and Miss Simmons were divorced in 1976. On Time and Under Budget A product of the studio system, Mr. Brooks was known for bringing his films in on time and under budget, with a working day that began at 9 A.M. and ended at 5 P.M. For M-G-M, he also made ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" (1958), ""The Last Hunt"" (1956), ""The Brothers Karamazov"" (1958) and ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" (1962). As an independent producer, he directed ""Lord Jim"" (1965), ""The Professionals"" (1966) and ""In Cold Blood"" (1967), based on the book by Truman Capote about the murder of a family in Kansas. His screenplay for the movie was nominated for an Academy Award. A string of box-office failures in the 1970's, notably ""Dollars"" (1971) and ""Bite the Bullet"" (1975), brought him to the edge of bankruptcy, but in 1977 he scored a commercial and critical success with ""Waiting for Mr. Goodbar,"" starring Diane Keaton as a young woman who is killed by a stranger she meets in a singles bar. Mr. Brooks wrote three novels, ""The Brick Foxhole"" (1945), ""The Boiling Point"" (1948) and ""The Producer"" (1951), an insider's look at Hollywood. He is survived by a daughter, Kate Brooks of Riverside, Calif., and a stepdaughter, Tracy Granger of Los Angeles."

18325,"Denis Dubourdieu, Who Elevated Wines and Educated Their Makers, Dies at 67","Denis Dubourdieu, a scientist, vineyard owner and winemaker who modernized the white wines of Bordeaux and, as a professor of enology at the University of Bordeaux, educated a generation of French vineyard managers, died on Tuesday in Bordeaux.","Denis Dubourdieu, a scientist, vineyard owner and winemaker who modernized the white wines of Bordeaux and, as a professor of enology at the University of Bordeaux, educated a generation of French vineyard managers, died on Tuesday in Bordeaux. He was 67. The cause was brain cancer, his son Jean-Jacques said. Mr. Dubourdieu (pronounced due-boor-DYU), often referred to in the French news media as the pope of white wine, or the professor of Bordeaux, owned and managed several estates in Bordeaux, where his family has made wine since the late 18th century. He was best known, however, for his research on wine chemistry and vinification, and his forward-looking techniques for making a new style of white Bordeaux, previously an afterthought to the region's great reds that was too often heavy and dull. ''Rejecting fashion and fads, he argued vehemently for finesse, elegance and freshness in Bordeaux wines,'' the magazine Le Point wrote in an appreciation after his death. His approach influenced winemakers throughout Bordeaux and won the admiration of critics around the world. ''The old days of insipid, tasteless, technically correct but uninteresting dry white wines from Bordeaux have ended,'' the critic Robert M. Parker wrote in the 1990s. ''Denis Dubourdieu is the man who profoundly changed white winemaking in this region.'' Denis Dubourdieu was born on July 1, 1949, in Barsac, France, and grew up on the family wine estate, Chteau Doisy-Dane, which his paternal grandfather had bought in 1924. After studying agronomy and economics, he enrolled in the University of Bordeaux, where he earned a doctorate in 1978 with a dissertation on the molecular structure of grapes affected by botrytis, a fungus responsible for the ''noble rot'' that makes possible the sweet, nectarlike wines of Barsac and Sauternes. He received a second doctorate in 1982, writing a dissertation on the filtering and clarifying of dessert wines like Sauternes, and in 1987 he was named a professor of enology at the university. His many scientific papers explored, among other topics, the causes of premature oxidation in red and white wines and the origin of the green, vegetal flavor prominent in underripe grapes. With the enologist Pascal Ribreau-Gayon and others, he revised and updated the two-volume ''Handbook of Enology,'' a standard text in the field. In 2009, he played a leading role in creating the Institute of Vine and Wine Sciences at the University of Bordeaux, a multidisciplinary research center that works with wine producers to introduce the latest technology and winemaking techniques. Mr. Dubourdieu's life as a researcher took a new turn in 1976 when his wife, the former Florence David, inherited Chteau Reynon in Bguey, whose wines carry the designation Cadillac Ctes de Bordeaux. The chateau, where he lived with his family for the rest of his life, became a testing ground for his ideas, which included aging wine in new oak barrels and extending the time that the grape skins remained in contact with the wine. He was an early advocate of organic winemaking and in recent years had explored new ways of adapting winemaking to climate change. He produced both red and white wines on several other estates that he later managed with his wife and two sons, Jean-Jacques and Fabrice: Clos Floridene and Chteau Haura in Graves and Chteau Cantegril in Barsac. In 2000 he took over the management of Chteau Doisy-Dane from his father, Pierre, who survives him. In addition to his wife and sons, he is also survived by a granddaughter. In the late 1980s, Mr. Dubourdieu branched out into a consulting career that took him to the top estates in Bordeaux, including Cheval Blanc and Yquem. Initially he concentrated on white wines, but in 1998, at the invitation of a former student, Vronique Sanders, the director of Chteau Haut-Bailly in Bordeaux, he turned his attention to red wines, opening a new chapter in his career. He advised dozens of estates in Bordeaux, including Chteau Margaux and Chteau de Rayne-Vigneau, as well as prominent estates and winemakers elsewhere in France and around the world. This year he was made a knight of the Legion of Honor for his contributions to French wine. He was the enology adviser to the most recent edition of The Oxford Companion to Wine. Mr. Dubourdieu was an enemy of pretense and impatient with the traditional secretiveness of the Bordeaux wine trade. Accessible, enthusiastic and keen to share information, he embodied the qualities that he championed in his wines. ''I like wines that are sensitive and poetic,'' he told Gilles Berdin, the author of ''Conversations Over a Bottle With Denis Dubourdieu'' (2012). ''They are the opposite of bragging-rights wines, the ones that basically are made to flatter the egos of the producers and even more so of the buyers.''"

6954,"Harry Flournoy Jr., 72, Part of a Pioneering Title Team","Harry Flournoy Jr., a captain of the first college basketball team to win the national championship with five black starting players, in 1966, died on Saturday in Atlanta.","Harry Flournoy Jr., a captain of the first college basketball team to win the national championship with five black starting players, in 1966, died on Saturday in Atlanta. He was 72. The cause was complications of kidney failure, said Steven B. Tredennick, a former member of that storied team, from Texas Western College. Flournoy and Orsten Artis were co-captains of the Texas Western Miners under Coach Don Haskins. Their championship run, capped by a victory over the all-white University of Kentucky team in the title game, was the basis of the book ''Glory Road'' (2005) and the film of the same name (2006), in which Mehcad Brooks played Flournoy and Josh Lucas played Haskins. Flournoy helped guide the team to a 28-1 record in the 1965-66 season, averaging 8.3 points and 10.7 rebounds a game. But he played only six minutes of the championship game. He was forced to the bench when he injured a knee. Texas Western went on to defeat Kentucky, coached by Adolph Rupp and led by Pat Riley, 72-65, at Cole Field House in College Park, Md., on March 19, 1966. The victory brought wide attention to racially exclusionary policies in the Southeastern Conference and elsewhere and contributed to the recruitment of black players nationwide. (The college was renamed the University of Texas at El Paso the next year.) Flournoy was born in Fall River, Mass., on Dec. 10, 1943. His family moved to Gary, Ind., when he was an infant, and he attended Emerson High School, where he ran track and played basketball. In a 2006 autobiographical essay, Flournoy wrote that he had been ''forced to deal with racism in many instances'' while still in high school. But having Haskins as his mentor ''helped me overcome my racial bias,'' he added. ''A weaker man would have given in to the pressure he was receiving from his peers,'' he wrote. ''They didn't like the confidence he had in the African-American players. If we had not won the championship, he could have lost his coaching position. Haskins, however, is a man who lives by his convictions, and he refused to let the opinions of others change his way of thinking.'' Haskins died in 2008. After college, Flournoy taught and coached basketball in El Paso before becoming a sales representative and moving to California in 1972. He is survived by his wife, Sukari, and many children and grandchildren. Flournoy was proud of his legacy at Texas Western. ''No longer,'' he wrote in 2006, ''could the excuse be used that 'blacks were not smart enough; were undisciplined; could not work under pressure; could not follow directions, and were not equipped to function on our own.''' He continued: ''That game was the catalyst that opened athletic, academic and employment doors for those who followed us. No longer would we be kept out of mainstream America.''"

Michael R. Peterson, a priest of the Archdiocese of Washington who was the founder of St. Luke Institute, a psychiatric hospital for priests and brothers and sisters of the Roman Catholic church, died Thursday of complications resulting from the AIDS virus. He was 44 years old. Archbishop James A. Hickey of Washington said in a news conference today that Father Peterson decided last February to publicly discuss his illness, after months of indecision, because he thought it would help other victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In a letter sent to every Catholic bishop in the country last month, Father Peterson wrote, ''I hope that in my own struggle with this disease, in finally acknowledging that I have this lethal syndrome, there might come some measure of compassion, understanding and healing for me and for others with it - especially those who face this disease alone and in fear.'' Father Peterson, who was born in Seattle in 1943, received a medical degree and certificate in psychiatry from the University of California. He worked for five years at the National Institutes of Health and in 1978 was ordained as a Catholic priest. He then founded St. Luke's Institute, a small psychiatric hospital in Washington that treats priests and religious men and women, primarily for drug and alcohol dependencies. He is survived by his parents, Preston and Patricia Wooley Peterson; a sister, Karen; and a brother, John."

He was 77. He died at his home in the Loma Linda district of this city. A Liberal Party activist who was imprisoned in 1944 after criticizing the dictator Tiburcio Carias Andino, Mr. Reina was elected president in November 1993 with promises to crack down on corruption and reduce the role of the military. He made gradual progress on both fronts during his four-year term. He eliminated mandatory military service, helping ease Honduras away from decades of military meddling in politics, though corruption, crime and poverty remain grave problems in the Central American nation. He survived a 1996 bombing that blew a hole in his house, though the bomber escaped. Mr. Reina underwent a gallbladder operation three weeks ago in San Antonio, returned home and was again hospitalized for four days later. ""He had problems with the gallbladder, which put pressure on the pancreas,"" said his brother, Jorge. ""In the end, that caused his death."" As a teenager, Mr. Reina was imprisoned for six months in 1944 for protesting against General Carias. He was briefly imprisoned by military governments in 1963 and 1968 as well. He was a law professor for 30 years at the National Autonomous University and was publisher of the Liberal Party newspaper El Pueblo in the 1960's. He was first elected to Congress in 1965. After his presidential term, he served as a judge of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and as ambassador to France.

He was 81. The cause apparently was heart failure, said a friend, Aleksander Shlahet. The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, first published by Macmillan in 1967 and still in print, was written by more than 500 contributors, many of them prominent philosophers. It devotes eight volumes to nearly 1,500 theories, thinkers and ideologies of all eras and continents. Professor Edwards, a longtime instructor at the New School and at Brooklyn College, wanted the encyclopedia to be comprehensive even at the risk of creating controversy. The entries related to existentialism, for example, ''point out confusion and lack of clarity in some of the ideas,'' he told The New York Times upon the encyclopedia's publication. A wry and caustic critic of religion, he wrote many of the entries on atheists. ''It seems to be agreed that an atheist can be a good man, and that his oaths and promises are no less trustworthy than those of other people,'' Professor Edwards wrote. In 1957, he edited a compilation of essays by Bertrand Russell, including ''Why I Am Not a Christian,'' which became the anthology's title. One of his own books, ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination'' (1996), criticized religious beliefs in rebirth ''There is no God, there is no life after death, Jesus was a man, and, perhaps most important, the influence of religion is by and large bad,'' he wrote in the current issue of Free Inquiry, a magazine about secular humanism, a school of thought that emphasizes values based on experience rather than religion. Professor Edwards was born to Jewish parents in Vienna on Sept. 2, 1923. His family immigrated to Australia during Hitler's rise to power, and he received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Melbourne. He later moved to Manhattan and, in 1951, received a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia. He taught at New York University in the 1960's, at Brooklyn College from 1966 to 1986, and at what is now the New School from the 1960's to the late 1990's. ''Heidegger's Confusions,'' a collection of Professor Edwards's scholarly articles, was published last month by Prometheus. ''God and Philosophers,'' also to be published by Prometheus, is a chronicle of various thinkers' approaches to the question of God. No immediate family members survive."

He was 60. The cause was throat cancer, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Thaw's death occurred almost exactly a year after that of his character in the final episode of ""Inspector Morse"" broadcast in the United States. Mr. Thaw announced in June that he had cancer but that he intended to continue acting. His series, based on novels by Colin Dexter, began in 1987; its 33 two-hour episodes were broadcast over 15 years. It was shown in the United States on the PBS ""Mystery"" series, beginning in 1988. It was estimated that 13 million people watched the final episode in Britain. The series was also shown in many other countries. Idiosyncratic characterization rather than fast action or complex plotting was what fascinated regular viewers of ""Inspector Morse,"" and the inspector gave them plenty. He was said to have graduated from Oxford, but was bone lazy. He ignored forensic science and could not stand the sight of blood. He drank too much and drove a bright red Jaguar. In the final show there was deft interplay between Inspector Morse and his sidekick, Sergeant Lewis, as both men faced retirement. Lewis, still polite to his boss, nevertheless admitted that he had not yet given up hope of succeeding him. ""I'll be an inspector soon, if there's any justice in the world,"" Lewis said with a trace of bitterness. Morse replied: ""I'm not sure there is."" He sighed, then remarked, ""If there were, this would not be Morse's last case."" Both the public and the critics adored Mr. Thaw's Inspector Morse. Reviewing one episode in 1988, the New York Times critic John J. O'Connor wrote: ""Solid, not flashy. Mr. Thaw gives the inspector a perfect turn."" In February 2001, Ron Wertheimer wrote in The Times that the secret of Mr. Thaw's performance was in ""locating that kernel of believability in the man to make yet another far-fetched tale seem real."" Often that kernel would be an endearing flaw rather then a virtue. Closing one episode, Mr. Thaw's Inspector Morse soothed himself with classical music and alcohol. ""If anyone wants me,"" he told the world, ""they'll find me looking at fish -- through the bottom of a beer glass."" Born in Manchester, in northern England, on Jan. 3, 1942, Mr. Thaw was the son of a truck driver. After dropping out of school, he worked as a laborer and a baker until a teacher who had seen him perform in school plays urged him to audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. He was accepted at the age of 17. Early in his professional career, he often played a police officer, onstage or on television. His first major success was as a tough, foul-mouthed cop in ""The Sweeney,"" a popular British television series that started in 1975 and lasted for three years. The role of Inspector Morse brought fame and fortune to Mr. Thaw. In 1993 he was honored as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The Inspector Morse shows had been ""an amazing success, beyond my wildest dreams,"" he said in an interview in The New York Times last year. Mr. Thaw is survived by his wife, the actress Sheila Hancock; two daughters, Abigail Thaw and Joanne Thaw; and a stepdaughter, Melanie Jane."

He was 75. The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Jean, said. Forged when television coverage of Olympic hockey was scant, the American triumph at the 1960 Games in California has largely been forgotten. The Squaw Valley champions remain in the shadow of the so-called Miracle on Ice team, which won the gold at the 1980 Lake Placid Games, and only two players from the 1960 squad -- goalie Jack McCartan, who played briefly for the Rangers, and forward Tom Williams -- went on to the National Hockey League. The amateurs of the 1960 squad defeated powerful Canadian and Soviet teams, then captured the Olympic championship with six goals in the third period for a 9-4 victory over Czechoslovakia. Roger Christian, who scored three goals in that period, and his brother and linemate Billy, who scored twice on assists by Roger in the previous game, a 3-2 win over the Soviet Union, were among the stars of the Olympic tournament. ''We were picked to finish fifth,'' Billy Christian said in an interview Sunday. ''Not until after we beat the Russians did anybody give us any hype.'' Both brothers were inducted into the United States Hockey of Fame in Eveleth, Minn., in the 1980s. Billy's son Dave played for the Miracle on Ice team and had a long career in the N.H.L., scoring 340 goals. After working as carpenters, Roger and Billy founded the hockey-stick manufacturer Christian Brothers in their native Warroad, Minn., in 1964. The company was selling about 500,000 sticks annually by the 1980s, some to N.H.L. players, under the slogan ''hockey sticks made by hockey players.'' Roger Allen Christian was born on Dec. 1, 1935. His father, Edward, a carpenter, repaired his sons' weather-beaten hockey sticks so they could play on frozen lakes and ponds. ''If you wanted to play, you had to shovel off a place first,'' Roger once told the Web site Vintage Minnesota Hockey. ''Most of the time, we'd go under the bridge because the ice was cleaner there. But we'd play anywhere we could, and it was for everybody -- boys, girls, anyone who wanted to play. We didn't have the luxury of an indoor arena or nice new skates or sticks.'' Roger played together with Billy and a third brother, Gordon, on the 1958 United States national team. He teamed with Billy and another pair of brothers, Bill and Bob Cleary, to provide scoring punch for the Squaw Valley champions. In addition to his brothers, Roger Christian's survivors include his wife, Jean; his sons, Roger Jr., Ryan and Rick; a sister, Sharon Ausman; and nine grandchildren. Roger and Billy Christian sold their stick-manufacturing company in 2002. They were on hand at the 2002 Salt Lake Games, but it was the members of the Miracle on Ice squad who lighted the Olympic caldron. Billy said that he and Roger were happy enough that Dave Christian and his 1980 teammates were saluted, and that, as he put it, ''Twenty years earlier, we had our run.''"

He was 74. His daughter, Susan, said the cause was complications after hip surgery. Dr. Harris, called ""one of the most controversial anthropologists alive"" by Smithsonian magazine in 1986, believed that human social life was shaped in response to the practical problems of human existence. He argued essentially that cultural differences did not matter much, a novel approach in a discipline dedicated to studying cultural differences. The Washington Post described him in 1983 as ""a storm center in his field."" And the Smithsonian article said he pitted himself ""against the mainstream of anthropological thought."" He even took on anthropology's godmother, Margaret Mead, though he was quick to point out that in this he was hardly alone. ""There's never been anything other than a good deal of disquiet about her methods,"" he told The New York Times in 1983. Dr. Harris, who called his approach ""cultural materialism,"" was an anthropology professor at Columbia University from 1953 until 1980, including three years as department chairman. From 1980 until 2000, he held a graduate research professorship at the University of Florida. But his provocative ideas, and equally provocative presentation, gave him a sphere of influence greatly exceeding that of an ordinary academic. Many of his 17 books were aimed at general audiences.

Absolutely necessary as a strategy of human existence, Dr. Harris contended: they are much more valuable for plowing fields and providing milk than as a one-time steak dinner. ""Westerners think that Indians would rather starve than eat their cows,"" he told Psychology Today. ""What they don't understand is that they will starve if they do eat their cows."" In Dr. Harris's view, then, a manufactured ""divine intervention"" was needed to encourage people simply to do the practical thing. The Jewish and Muslim bans on eating pork? Pigs eat the same foods as humans, he reasoned, and are expensive to keep. Sheep, goats and cattle, by contrast, thrive on grass, and provide wool, milk and labor. Warfare? A way of curbing population when protein gets scarce. Neckties? A badge men wear to indicate they are above physical labor. Witchcraft? A convenient culprit for the rising protest that church and state faced from the 15th century to the 17th. Dr. Harris's zest for controversy was suggested by the title of an article he wrote for The New York Times Magazine in 1977: ""Why Men Dominate Women."" So was his contention that Aztec cannibalism sprang from a need for protein sufficiency, a view that drew some strong opposition. ""It takes an heroic act of utilitarian faith to conclude that this sacrificial system was a way the Aztecs had for getting more meat,"" Marshall Sahlins wrote in The New York Review of Books in 1978. Marvin Harris was born in Brooklyn. Growing up in New York City in the 1930's, he wanted to understand the millions of strangers around him. He would stare at the windows of apartment buildings, wondering about the figures behind them. He graduated from Columbia, then earned his doctorate there. As a young professor, he was critical of the university's administration and a strong supporter of student protests of the 1960's. David B. Truman, vice president and provost, accused him of ""authoritarian madness."" Though his studies took him throughout the world, from Brazil to Mozambique to India, he kept his own country in his anthropological sights. In ""The Anthropology of a Changing Culture"" (Simon & Schuster, 1981), he railed against home-grown outrages he perceived, from appliances that did not work to bloated government bureaucracies. In The New York Times Book Review, Robert Lekachman called the book -- which was rereleased in 1987 under the author's original title, ""Why Nothing Works: The Anthropology of Daily Life"" -- a ""remarkably concise, angry outcry at the current condition of America."" His other books included ""Cannibals and Kings"" (Random House, 1977) and ""Culture, People and Nature,"" which became a widely used anthropology textbook. In addition to his daughter, who lives in the San Francisco area, he is survived by his wife, Madeline."

She was 77. The cause was cardiac arrest, said Wendy Oxenhorn, director of the Jazz Foundation of America, which had been helping to provide Ms. Reid with health care for more than a decade. A jazz vocalist whose style was heavily laced with elements of gospel and the blues, Ms. Reid never achieved as much success as contemporaries like Dinah Washington and Esther Phillips who took a similar approach. But she worked steadily, and she finished her life on a high note with a surprising career resurgence.Born in Savannah, Ga., on Sept. 23, 1930, Ms. Reid began singing in a church choir there and moved to New York in 1947 to pursue a singing career. After winning the Apollo Theater's amateur contest several times, she spent two years with the Dick Vance band at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem before going out on her own. She joined the Basie band in 1961 and stayed for a year, then formed her own small group, Irene Reid and Company, and recorded two big-band albums for Verve, one of the leading jazz labels of the period. But probably her most prominent job in the post-Basie years was on Broadway, where she briefly joined the cast of ''The Wiz'' as the wicked witch Evillene, the role originated by Mabel King. In 1997, after two decades spent largely under the show-business radar, Ms. Reid began recording for the small Savant label with the organist Charles Earland. Her album ''Million Dollar Secret'' was the first of six she released as a leader in her last years -- more than she had in her entire career up to that time. She also worked frequently at Smoke, the Lenox Lounge and other New York nightclubs until a few years ago, when health problems forced her to stop performing. She is survived by a daughter, Gwendolyn Reid; four sons, Michael Leon Redfield, Bernard Redfield, James Raymond Reid and Gregory Reid; 13 grandchildren, and 9 great-grandchildren."

He was 84 and lived in New York City. Mr. Brandt was born in Greensboro, N.C., and moved to New York after high school, attending Pratt Institute at night. He studied with Yasuo Kuniyoshi at the Art Students League and, after five years as an official portraitist in the Army during World War II, continued his education under the G.I. Bill. He studied with Philip Guston and Max Beckmann at Washington University in St. Louis. All the while he kept close ties with Abstract Expressionists in New York, and his art reflected their influence. With his wife, Carolyn Coker, he traveled widely in the 1950's, throughout Europe and back and forth from New York to North Carolina and Mississippi, where Mr. Brandt held teaching positions. In 1960, after he and his wife were divorced, he married Grace Borgenicht, an artist and art dealer in New York who had a gallery on 57th Street and was an early champion of contemporary American art. Mr. Brandt moved to New York and made a radical change in his art, developing a Matissesque style in nudes, still lifes and scenes from his studio. One painting, ""The Artist in His Studio,"" from 1979, in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, shows an inviting domestic space filled with plants, fruit, a conch shell and fine furniture; in the background Mr. Brandt is seen reflected in a mirror, working on his canvas in a homely apron. Mr. Brandt showed often at the Sachs gallery on Madison Avenue and the Fischbach gallery on 57th Street, and his paintings are in the collections of the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the National Academy of Design in New York and the Carnegie Institute Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, in addition to the Met.

He was 89 years old. Mr. Canutt, who began his film career in the 1920's, was awarded a special Oscar in 1966 for helping to create the stunt man's profession and for developing safety devices used by stunt men everywhere. Among his movie credits was the choreography of the chariot race in the 1959 epic ''Ben Hur.'' For the race, Mr. Canutt started work in Italy two years before regular production began, training 80 horses to pull chariots. Enos Edward Canutt was born Nov. 29, 1896, in Colfax, Wash., and took his nickname from Washington's Yakima Valley. After a stint as a prize-winning rodeo rider, he moved on to Hollywood in the early 1920's, working first as an actor in silent westerns. He turned to full-time stunt work after the advent of the talkies, substituting for a long list of stars including Mr. Wayne, Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power, Clark Gable, Henry Fonda, Roy Rogers, Randolph Scott and Tex Ritter. Mr. Canutt also directed several Westerns, including ''Sheriff of Cimarron'' in 1945 and ''Oklahoma Badlands'' in 1948. He is survived by his wife, a son, a brother and a sister."
3020,"Eddie Yost, 86, Baseball's 'Walking Man'","Eddie Yost, a durable and reliable third baseman for three American League teams whose penchant for garnering bases on balls earned him the nickname the Walking Man, died on Tuesday in Weston, Mass.","Eddie Yost, a durable and reliable third baseman for three American League teams whose penchant for garnering bases on balls earned him the nickname the Walking Man, died on Tuesday in Weston, Mass. He was 86. The death was confirmed by his daughter Felita Yost Carr, who said her father had heart problems. Yost made his major league debut with the Washington Senators in 1944, when he was just 17, and never played in the minor leagues. Fourteen of his 18 big-league seasons were spent with the lowly Senators, who finished as high as fourth just once while he was playing for them. He was, however, a stalwart, playing in 829 consecutive games from August 1949 to May 1955, still the ninth-longest streak in baseball history. He was the sort of pesky player who gave more powerful teams fits; in the early 1950s, the Yankees were known to covet him, though they never managed to pry him away in a trade. Casey Stengel, the Yankee manager, selected Yost for the 1952 All-Star Game, his only such honor, even though Yost was in the midst of a season in which he hit just .233. ''Every time I look up, that feller is on base,'' Stengel explained. Indeed, Yost's forte was getting on base, especially by way of the walk. A student of opposing pitchers, he had a keen eye, a precise sense of the strike zone and the deft bat control to spoil good pitchers' pitches by fouling them off. In one game, in 1953, he fouled off a total of 20 pitches in two consecutive at bats. Yost led the American League in walks six times, and though he was a below-average hitter, his on-base percentage was over .400 -- a stellar figure -- in nine different seasons. He led the league in that category twice. He also had some power, hitting 139 home runs in spite of playing most of his home games in Washington's notoriously spacious Griffith Stadium. Had Yost played a few decades later, in the ''Moneyball'' era, when the ability to get on base became a more valued quality, he might have achieved greater fame. For his career he batted just .254, but his on-base percentage was .394, higher than that of a long list of current or future Hall of Famers, including Frank Robinson (.389), Tony Gwynn (.388), Willie Mays (.384) and Derek Jeter (.382). Edward Frederick Yost was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 13, 1926, and grew up in Queens. His father, Frederick, was a typesetter for a printing company. Edward went to John Adams High School in Queens and entered New York University, where as a freshman he played basketball and baseball. In the summer of 1944, he had tryouts with the Red Sox as well as the Senators, who signed him and had him playing in seven games for the team before his 18th birthday. During the off-season he joined the Navy, serving 18 months in the United States as World War II came to an end. He would later finish his studies at N.Y.U., attending classes during the off-season and earning a bachelor's degree from the school of education in 1951. When he returned to the Senators in 1946, they wanted to send him to the minors to hone his skills, but a provision of the G.I. Bill that guaranteed a returning serviceman the job he left behind forced the Senators to keep him. Yost was actually in favor of going to the minors, believing he wasn't yet ready for the big leagues, and he wrote to the commissioner of baseball, Happy Chandler, offering to waive his right to stay with the Senators. Chandler, however, kept him where he was, evidently wary of setting a precedent. Yost played in only eight games for the Senators in 1946, but by the middle of the next season he was the regular third baseman. Yost finished his career playing two seasons for the Detroit Tigers and two more for an expansion team, the Los Angeles Angels. While with Detroit, he met his wife, the former Patricia Healy, who worked in public relations for the club. She died in 2007. In addition to his daughter Felita, he is survived by another daughter, Alexis Yost Fougere; a son, Michael; a sister, Rosemary Huebner; and two grandchildren. In his later years he lived in Wellesley Hills, Mass., where he restored antique carousel horses. When his playing days were done, Yost spent more than two decades as a coach, first for the expansion team Washington Senators (the original Senators had moved to Minnesota and became the Twins) and later for the Boston Red Sox. In between, from 1968 to 1976, he coached third base for the Mets, not far from where he grew up. In 1969, the so-called Miracle Mets unexpectedly won the World Series, Yost's only taste of a championship."

Mr. Minskoff, who directed the building of the Minskoff Theater, on Broadway at West 45th Street, was the last surviving child of Sam Minskoff, a noted real estate developer in New York. The Minskoff family has long owned and managed buildings in Manhattan. In a 1981 interview, Myron Minskoff recalled that his father had said to him, "" 'Women will teach you how to build apartments; get their complaints, remember them and you will be a good builder.' "" Mr. Minskoff added, ""He was right."" Myron and two brothers, Henry and Jerome, took over Sam Minskoff & Sons, based in Manhattan, after their father died in 1950. The three became equal partners. Myron was the company's partner in charge of construction from 1950 until 1981, when he left it to form his own company, Myron A. Minskoff Inc. During those three decades with his brothers, he oversaw the construction of almost $2 billion worth of buildings. Sam Minskoff & Sons was dissolved in the early 1990's. The new company, also based in Manhattan, engages in real estate investment and development. Mr. Minskoff was its president for almost two decades, from its founding until his death. His son-in-law, Robb Aley Allan, who is also an executive there, said it would continue its operations. In overseeing the design and construction of the 1,710-seat Minskoff Theater in the early 1970's, Mr. Minskoff studied other theaters with a goal of creating more pleasant backstage environments for Broadway workers. He also collaborated with the lighting designer Abe Feder on the theater's stage and offstage lighting. Mr. Minskoff was also involved in the development of 1350 Avenue of the Americas, a 35-floor office building; 420 East 58th Street, a 27-story condominium; and the Rolex Building, 665 Fifth Avenue. Myron Allen Minskoff was born in the Bronx and attended Lehigh University and Columbia University's School of Architecture. He was chairman of Park East Synagogue on East 68th Street from 1962 to 1972, on the board of Yeshiva University from 1965 to 1972, and was a founding board member of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, which has sought to foster interfaith dialogue.

3896,"Mary Hinkson, a Star for Martha Graham, Dies at 89","Mary Hinkson, one of Martha Graham's most important leading dancers, whose performances from the 1950s through the early '70s were filled with unbridled dramatic power, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan.","Mary Hinkson, one of Martha Graham's most important leading dancers, whose performances from the 1950s through the early '70s were filled with unbridled dramatic power, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89. Her daughter, Jennifer Jackson Hardy, said the cause was pulmonary fibrosis. Ms. Hinkson, who was one of the first two black dancers to join the Martha Graham Dance Company, was also a frequent guest artist with other choreographers and became an influential teacher both in the United States and abroad. She was a highly versatile member of the Graham troupe. In the title role of ''Circe,'' which Graham created for her in 1963, Ms. Hinkson exuded a mix of ferocity and subtlety as the sorceress who casts a spell on Ulysses. Coaching her in the role, Graham told her that she must look at him obliquely, as if she were an animal sensing his presence. By contrast, with straightforward serenity and elegance, Ms. Hinkson made the figure in white in ''Diversion of Angels,'' a signature role, a symbol of love. In the early 1970s she appeared in a revival of Graham's ''Deaths and Entrances'' as Emily Bront, a role Graham herself had danced. Ms. Hinkson stunned audiences with the sharp-angled savagery of her dance of madness in a widely hailed performance. ''Mary Hinkson was a goddess Graham dancer,'' Lise Houlton, artistic director of Minnesota Dance Theater and a former member of American Ballet Theater, told Dance magazine in 2008. While teaching a class, Ms. Houlton recalled, Ms. Hinkson might spend 45 minutes walking across the studio floor. ''Somehow,'' Ms. Houlton said, ''the house was on fire when she did it. She had us spellbound.'' In 1951 Ms. Hinkson and Matt Turney, her roommate at the University of Wisconsin, became the first black dancers to join the Graham company. With her perfect execution of the Graham dance vocabulary, however, Ms. Hinkson made her reputation as a Graham dancer and was not defined as a dancer who usually explored the black heritage. She resisted being seen through a racial prism, though she acknowledged she would be. ''We will have to speak of the 'Negro dancer' until people are finally considered only on the grounds of their talent and merit,'' she told Dance magazine in 1966. Yet she was aware that she was breaking racial boundaries in the dance world at the height of the civil rights movement. When Ms. Hinkson received the Martha Hill Award, a prestigious dance prize, on Monday, her granddaughter, Elsa Hardy, accepting it on her behalf, recalled that as Ms. Hinkson and Ms. Turney sat by a fountain in Italy while on tour in 1954, they wept on learning of the Supreme Court ruling ending school segregation. Mary De Haven Hinkson was born on March 16, 1925, in Philadelphia. Her father, De Haven Hinkson, was a physician. During World War II, Dr. Hinkson was assigned to establish the station hospital at Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama, the home of the all-black fighter group the Tuskegee Airmen. At the University of Wisconsin, Ms. Hinkson's mentor was Margaret H'Doubler, a pioneering dance educator, who introduced her to Graham's work. She received a bachelor's degree there in 1946 and a master's in 1947. After graduating, she and three other students formed the Wisconsin Dance Group, a small modern dance troupe that toured in the Midwest. The group was interracial and included Ms. Turney, Miriam Cole and Sage Fuller, who later danced as Sage Cowles after marrying the newspaper executive John Cowles. Ms. Hinkson and Ms. Turney then left for New York University and an eight-week course with Graham there that led to their joining her company. When the Graham troupe was not performing, Ms. Hinkson accepted invitations from other choreographers. She had a periodic association with John Butler and Glen Tetley, both Graham alumni. She appeared with Tetley's modern dance troupe and in ''Ricercare,'' a duet he choreographed for her and Scott Douglas at American Ballet Theater in 1966. As ballet director of the New York City Opera in the 1950s, Butler created roles for Ms. Hinkson in ''Carmina Burana,'' ''Bluebeard's Castle'' and Menotti's ''Amahl and the Night Visitors,'' which was televised. During this period she married Julien Jackson Jr. He later bought the D&G Bakery in Manhattan's Little Italy. After he died in 1983, the bakery was managed by Ms. Hinkson, her daughter and her niece before being sold in 1997. Besides her daughter and her granddaughter, Ms. Hinkson is survived by her sister, Cordelia Hinkson Brown, and a grandson, Jeremy Hardy. Ms. Turney died in 2009. In 1959, another choreographer, Donald McKayle, who had also danced with the Graham troupe and was interested in the black heritage, featured Ms. Hinkson in the premiere of ''Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder,'' which became his signature piece. In another powerful role, she performed as the mother and sweetheart envisioned by prisoners on a chain gang. A change of pace came when Balanchine invited Ms. Hinkson to dance with his company's black star, Arthur Mitchell, in Balanchine's new ''Figure in the Carpet'' at the New York City Ballet in 1960. Appearing in an imagined 18th-century court divertissement, she and Mr. Mitchell portrayed an African prince and his consort. Walter Terry, dance critic of The New York Herald Tribune, called their performance ''exceptionally lively and majestic.'' But Ms. Hinkson's heart belonged to the Graham repertoire, which increasingly provided her with great roles and success in works like ''Cave of the Heart,'' ''Seraphic Dialogue'' and ''Clytemnestra.'' Ms. Hinkson and the dancer Bertram Ross directed the company when Graham became ill in 1970 but clashed with her on her return. Ms. Hinkson, already a famed teacher in the United States and abroad, resigned from the company in 1973 and retired as a dancer. She never regretted leaving, she told Robert Tracy for his 1996 book, ''Goddess: Martha Graham's Dancers Remember.'' But, she added, ''It does not diminish for one moment my 23-year commitment to Martha Graham.''"

Powers, the longtime head of the New York printers' union, who led one of the nation's longest and most debilitating newspaper strikes and years later negotiated a contract that guaranteed his members jobs for life as computers eclipsed their craft, died Saturday in Washington.","Bertram A. Powers, the longtime head of the New York printers' union, who led one of the nation's longest and most debilitating newspaper strikes and years later negotiated a contract that guaranteed his members jobs for life as computers eclipsed their craft, died Saturday in Washington. He was 84. The cause of death was pneumonia, said his son, Brian A. Powers of Washington. Mr. Powers had lived in the Union Square neighborhood of Manhattan for 30 years until moving to Washington nine weeks ago to be closer to family as his health began to fail. As president of Local 6 of the International Typographical Union from 1961 until his retirement in 1990, Mr. Powers was known as a hard bargainer who had little faith in the altruism of employers. He often said ''the only thing that counts is muscle.'' At the height of his power in the early 1960s, he was spoken of in the same breath as the biggest national labor figures of the period, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president George Meany and the Teamsters' leader Jimmy Hoffa. ''He gave me some advice once. He said, 'Always do what's best for your members and don't pay that much attention to everything else that's going on around you,' '' said Barry Lipton, the president of the New York Newspaper Guild. It was advice that Mr. Powers relied upon himself as he came under withering criticism during the 114-day newspaper strike of 1962 and 1963. Mr. Powers was elected president of Local 6, popularly known as ''Big Six,'' in 1961. Chief among his concerns was ending the long-held practice of New York publishers of reaching a new contract with one of the 10 New York newspaper unions and imposing those terms on all of them. On Dec. 8, 1962, Mr. Powers led Big Six, the nation's oldest craft union, on its first walkout in nearly 80 years. For the next 16 weeks, The New York Times, The Daily News, The Herald Tribune and the city's four other dailies were silenced. The shutdown cost the newspapers an estimated $108 million in lost advertising and circulation revenue, and nearly 20.000 newspaper employees were out of work. The sides eventually agreed to a settlement hammered out by Mayor Robert F. Wagner. The printers received a wage and benefit increase of $12.63 a week -- significantly less than the $37 Mr. Powers had demanded, but more than the $10 originally offered by the publishers. The deal also ended staggered expiration dates for the various unions' contracts, which gave the unions, when they were united, more leverage in negotiations. Victory or not, the strike and Mr. Powers were widely blamed for the demise of four of city's daily newspapers over the next five years, a notion that Mr. Powers flatly rejected. At the same time, his hard-line stands left him more popular than ever with his membership. When the union's contract expired in 1973, Mr. Powers avoided strikes and turned to work slowdowns instead as the printers negotiated a new deal in the face of automation that threatened to end their careers. In the end, Mr. Powers negotiated a settlement in which the printers agreed to let their jobs be phased out by automation. In exchange, they received what many labor leaders called an unprecedented guarantee: that they could remain employed with their companies for life.. The printers' union steadily lost membership as automation took over, and has since merged with the Communications Workers of America. Bertram Anthony Powers, one of six children, was born in Cambridge, Mass., on March 8, 1922. His early years were marked by difficulty. His father, a civil servant, lost his job during the Depression. And in 1933, when he was 11, his mother died. Mr. Powers dropped out of high school in the 10th grade to join the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1937, he was run over by a truck, leaving him in pain and with a limp the rest of his life. He got his start as a printer in Fitchburg, Mass., and moved from job to job before landing in New York City in 1946. He joined Local 6 and gradually ascended its ranks. Mr. Powers's wife of 43 years, Patricia Powers, a writer and college professor, died in 1988. Besides his son Brian, he is survived by his son Kevin, of Buffalo; two daughters, Patricia Inciardi of Novato, Calif., and Moya Keating of Chatham, N.J.; and nine grandchildren. He is also survived by three sisters. In 1963, as the newspaper strike reached its 75th day, President John F. Kennedy publicly criticized Mr. Powers. ''It is clear,'' the president said, ''in the case of the New York newspaper strike, that the local of the International Typographical Union and its president, Bertram Powers, insofar as anyone can understand his positions, are attempting to impose a settlement which could shut down several newspapers in New York and throw thousands out of work.'' Coming from an Irish-American from Boston and a staunch Democrat, the president's rebuke was particularly stinging, said Brian Powers, who is a labor lawyer. But publicly, Mr. Powers appeared unfazed. ''President Kennedy has been ill-advised,'' he told Time magazine, which put him on its March 1, 1963, cover along with a illustration of a monkey wrench jamming a printing press. Years later, however, he would call the strike a ''severe experience.''"

Mr. Bridges, who was known as Sheriff, broke into the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals and also pitched for the Cincinnati Reds, the New York Yankees and the Washington Senators before returning to the minor leagues after the 1965 season. He began his pro career with the Memphis Red Sox in the old Negro leagues. His best season was 1962, when he was 8-4 with 18 saves for the World Series champion Yankees. In that year he allowed the first World Series grand slam home run by a National League player, hit by Chuck Hiller of the San Francisco Giants in Game 4."
40572,"Rosalie Sorrels, Folk Singer and Vivid Storyteller, Is Dead at 83","Rosalie Sorrels, a singer and storyteller who drew on her own tempestuous life in songs of struggle and heartache that inspired a generation of rising folk musicians in the 1980s, died on Sunday in Reno, Nev., at the home of her daughter Holly Marizu.","Rosalie Sorrels, a singer and storyteller who drew on her own tempestuous life in songs of struggle and heartache that inspired a generation of rising folk musicians in the 1980s, died on Sunday in Reno, Nev., at the home of her daughter Holly Marizu. She was 83. The death was announced by family members. Ms. Marizu said that the cause of death had not been determined, but that her mother had been suffering from dementia and colon cancer. Ms. Sorrels (pronounced sore-ELS) first came to widespread attention at the 1966 Newport Folk Festival, where she performed traditional songs from Idaho, her native state, and Utah, where she lived with her family. She soon began writing her own material, about life on the road, her marital difficulties and the challenges of raising children. She then broadened her scope to include social issues like prison reform, suicide prevention and women's rights. As a singer, Ms. Sorrels was influenced by Billie Holiday, and her jazz-inflected phrasings often perplexed her accompanists. But she delivered her songs with a throbbing intensity that came straight from the folk tradition. The critic John Rockwell, describing her voice in The New York Times in 1979, wrote, ''It's full and rich, with a plaintive vibrato that thins out delicately on top, unless she's pushing for volume, in which case it becomes -- if such a thing is possible -- an evocative, stirring bray.'' Ms. Sorrels developed a storytelling approach, surrounding her songs with tales of her childhood, her parents and grandparents, and the early settlers of the West. The effect could be incantatory. ''It's usually a big dark room, and there's this woman onstage with this beautiful, rich, velvety voice who's telling you this story or singing you a song, and then she stops and she tells a little story, and then the song continues, and she stops,'' the singer Christine Lavin told NPR in 2003. ''It's like you're sitting around a campfire and there's this great wise shaman. And it completely transports you out of yourself.'' Although she performed before multitudes at Woodstock in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1972, Ms. Sorrels didn't break through to fame and fortune. She once estimated that she had never earned more than $20,000 in a single year. She spent most of her career in small clubs and often performed, gratis, at benefits for a variety of social causes. But her personal songwriting style and intimate way with audiences influenced younger folk artists like Ms. Lavin, Mary Chapin Carpenter and Nanci Griffith, whose song ''Ford Econoline'' paid tribute to Ms. Sorrels' travels around the country with five children in tow. ''I think she's influenced a lot of people who don't even know her name,'' Ms. Lavin told The Boston Globe in 2003. The music historian Elijah Wald, writing in The Boston Globe in 1985, called Ms. Sorrels ''a legend in folk music circles,'' adding: ''She traveled around the country while raising five children. She drinks strong men under the table and is the first one up in the morning, bright and cheery and planning one of her famous dinners. And she can make the noisiest barroom crowd shut up and listen when she sings.'' She was born Rosalie Ann Stringfellow on June 24, 1933, in Boise, Idaho. Her father, Walter, was an engineer for the state highway department. Her mother, the former Nancy Ann Kelly, ran the Book Shop in downtown Boise. Both loved song and poetry. Rosalie, capitalizing on her father's offer of 50 cents for each ''chunk'' of poetry she could recite, once pocketed three dollars by memorizing Sir Walter Scott's ''The Lady of the Lake.'' She sang and played leading roles in high school drama productions. At 16 she ended a pregnancy with an illegal abortion. After being accepted to the University of Idaho on a drama scholarship, she was raped and became pregnant again. Sent to a home for unwed mothers in Los Angeles, she gave birth to a daughter, whom she put up for adoption. While performing at the Boise Little Theater, she fell in love with a fellow actor, Jim Sorrels, a telephone lineman by trade. They married in 1952 and moved to Salt Lake City, where their house became a magnet for visiting artists, singers and writers. Ms. Sorrels began tuning in to the folk-singing traditions of the West. She took classes with the folklorist Wayland Hand, learned to play the guitar, gathered folk songs from quilting bees sponsored by the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, and studied folk songs that her grandmother had pasted into a scrapbook. ''I got myself a tape recorder and started accosting perfectly nice old folks who were minding their own business, asking them for their old songs and stories,'' Ms. Sorrels told the folk-music magazine Sing Out! in 2004. ''I collected a couple of hundred old Mormon songs.'' The Smithsonian Institution's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage recorded her performing a selection of Western folk songs, accompanied by her husband on guitar, and released it in 1961 as ''Folk Songs of Idaho and Utah.'' That year she also recorded ''Rosalie Sorrels Sings Songs of the Mormon Pioneers,'' accompanied by her husband and the Singing Saints. Turning manager, Ms. Sorrels brought Joan Baez and Jean Ritchie to Salt Lake City. Ms. Ritchie returned the favor by inviting Ms. Sorrels to sing at Newport. It was a pivotal moment. That year she left her husband and recorded the album ''If I Could Be the Rain.'' Released in 1967, it included six of her own songs and six by the folk singer Utah Phillips, whose career she revived. She made good on the record's promise in 1972 with the album ''Travelin' Lady,'' whose title song, about leaving her husband and heading out on the road, became her signature. Its personal, urgent songwriting reflected the influence of Malvina Reynolds, the writer of ''Little Boxes'' and other songs, whom Ms. Sorrels sought out in San Francisco. ''There was really a sense at the beginning of the '60s revival that it was the province of the male society to write the songs; that Judy Collins and Joan Baez were very fine, but basically girl singers using male songs,'' Ms. Sorrels told The Boston Globe in 2000. ''Malvina helped teach us how to take our personal feelings into our songs; that you recognize what's funny or meaningful about you as a woman singing about these issues and put that into your songs.'' She lived a vagabond life, moving from town to town and staying with friends, often parking her children as she went on tour. ''When you said, you know, the kind of generic, 'How are you?' you were braced for this kind of litany of trials and tribulations and everything,'' the singer and songwriter Loudon Wainwright III told NPR. ''She'd say, 'This one's in jail, and that one burned down the building, and she had an operation. But I wrote two songs last week.''' Ms. Sorrels recorded two dozen albums, including ''Miscellaneous Abstract Record No. 1'' (1982), a collection of her favorite traditional songs, as well as ''What Does It Mean to Love?'' (1994) and ''Borderline Heart'' (1995). Two of her albums were nominated for Grammy Awards: ''Strangers in Another Country: The Songs of Bruce 'Utah' Phillips'' and ''My Last Go-Round: Rosalie Sorrels and Friends'' (2004), a live recording of a tribute concert. Ms. Sorrels moved back to Idaho in 1983 and settled into a cabin that her father had built on Grimes Creek, near Idaho City. In addition to her daughter Holly she is survived by another daughter, Shelley Ross, a son, Kevin, a brother, Jim, five grandchildren and two great-grandsons. Her oldest son, David, committed suicide in 1976, an event that inspired her song ''Hitchhiker in the Rain.'' Her daughter Leslie died in 2016. Speaking to Idaho public television in 2005, Ms. Sorrels summed up her career: ''I'm an actress. I'm a troubadour. I take the news from place to place. I do it with music. I do it with poetry and stories, and I try to connect.''"
36641,"Thomas Libous, Powerful New York Senator Felled by Scandal, Dies at 63","Thomas W. Libous, the once-influential former state senator whose reputation was tarnished by a late-life criminal conviction, died on Tuesday at a hospice center in Endicott, N.Y.","Thomas W. Libous, the once-influential former state senator whose reputation was tarnished by a late-life criminal conviction, died on Tuesday at a hospice center in Endicott, N.Y. He was 63. The cause of death was prostate cancer, Emmanuel Priest, a spokesman for the family, said. A usually affable veteran of the dysfunctional and often ethically challenged culture of Albany, Mr. Libous -- a Republican from the state's Southern Tier whose district included Binghamton -- was ensnared in a scandal of his own in 2014, when he was indicted on charges of lying to federal agents who were investigating the hiring of his son at a politically connected law firm. Mr. Libous was convicted the next year, a precursor to the guilty verdicts of two even more powerful colleagues: Sheldon Silver, a Democrat and former speaker of the Assembly, and Dean G. Skelos, Mr. Libous's sometime Republican rival and onetime Senate majority leader. Mr. Silver and Mr. Skelos were convicted on federal corruption charges in the months after Mr. Libous was found guilty; on Tuesday, Mr. Silver was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Mr. Libous was the second-highest-ranking Republican senator at the time of his conviction, which resulted in his expulsion from the Legislature. Even after the verdict was read, Mr. Libous, who was sentenced in November to probation and home confinement in light of his terminal cancer, did not seem to blame the jury or the prosecutors for his fate. ''Everybody treated us fine, and this is the system,'' he said on the courthouse steps. ''I'm disappointed, but we move on.'' With a fireplug's frame and a deal maker's demeanor, Mr. Libous spent nearly three decades in the Senate, earning a reputation as a reliably reasonable lawmaker. He worked closely with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who often found common ground with the senator and his fellow Republicans. On Tuesday, the leader of the Senate Democrats, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, praised Mr. Libous's willingness to reach across the aisle. ''We were always able to work together because of his good nature,'' Senator Stewart-Cousins said. ''He will be truly missed.'' Mr. Libous was first elected in 1988 after a stint on the Binghamton City Council, and his easy manner with colleagues and constituents may have been derived from his retail roots: He grew up working at his family's grocery store in Binghamton, the big city of the Southern Tier, which has suffered through decades of economic malaise. Mr. Libous seemed attuned to those concerns, lobbying governors -- both Democrat and Republican -- for projects and economic protections for the region, including securing more than $150 million for capital projects for Binghamton University, one of the area's larger employers, amid a deterioration of manufacturing. Over the years, he would lead committees on a range of social issues and other topics, including alcoholism and drug abuse, people with disabilities and mental health, according to his Senate biography. In 2009, he received a diagnosis of prostate cancer and subsequently founded a group, I Turned Pro, to raise awareness about the disease and to encourage men in their 50s and older to consult with their doctors. He continued to serve until his conviction, outlasting several governors, majority leaders and late budgets. Still, despite being well liked in his chamber, his trial laid bare some less savory aspects of Mr. Libous's Capitol dealings, including promises to steer business to a Westchester County law firm where his son Matthew Libous hoped to be employed. (Before his father's conviction, he was convicted of tax fraud in 2015 and sentenced to six months in prison.) In addition to his son Matthew, Mr. Libous is survived by his wife, Frances M. Libous; another son, Nicholas; and a grandson, Campbell. After his sentencing, an increasingly frail Mr. Libous spoke to a crowd of reporters outside the courthouse in White Plains, making a statement whose meaning could have echoed all the way to Albany. ''This is not about me; this is about justice and giving people a fair shake,'' he said, holding his wife's arm. ''At the end of the day, anybody could fall into a trap like I did.''"

Martell, 68, Is Dead; Doyen in the Land of Cognac","Rene Firino Martell, who engineered the $850 million sale of his family's cognac company to Seagram in 1988, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Nice, France.","Rene Firino Martell, who engineered the $850 million sale of his family's cognac company to Seagram in 1988, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Nice, France. He was 68 and a resident of Cognac, the small southwestern town that his family has dominnated for almost three centuries. Spokesmen for the family said the cause of death was a heart attack. An eighth-generation descendant of Jean Martell, the wine merchant from the Isle of Jersey who founded the cognac company in 1715, Mr. Martell, who took over as chairman in 1977, significantly extended the company's reach. By 1987 Martell, the second-largest cognac brand after Hennesey, was a household name around the world. But for all his marketing achievements in selling cognac, Mr. Martell outdid himself in selling the cognac company. Skillfully playing off rival bids from two giant suitors, Mr. Martell almost doubled the value of the company over six months of negotiations. The sale of the company began in July 1987, when Grand Metropolitan, a British wine and spirits conglomerate, acquired a 10 percent interest in a deal that put the value of the Martell company at $500 million. It ended in January 1988, when Seagram, the giant Canadian distiller, bought the entire company for $850 million, a staggering 36 times Martell's annual earnings. Mr. Martell, who was born in Cognac, was educated there, in nearby Bourdeux and in the United States before returning to Cognac, a town of 21,000. As chairman of a company controlled by 40 members of his family, who owned about two-fifths of its stock, Mr. Martell was regarded as a patriarch both to the company and to the town. ""Monsieur Rene has been like a father to us,"" Jacques Durand, the proprietor of a Cognac restaurant, said when the deal with Seagram was being negotiated. Although Seagram indicated it wanted to keep the Martell family involved in the management after the sale, Mr. Durand and other Cognac residents predicted at the time that he had been too accustomed to operating on his own to report to distant corporate bosses. They were right: the sale to Seagram was completed in February 1988; Mr. Martll retired the next year. He is survived by his wife, Genevieve Caduouy Eymard, and five children, Flore, Antoine, Chantal, Elizabeth and Jean."

Gelb, the former chief executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb and a former director of The New York Times Company, died yesterday morning at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, his wife, Phyllis, said. He was 79 years old and lived on the Upper East Side. As chairman and chief executive of Bristol-Myers, Mr. Gelb presided over the company's merger with Squibb in 1989, creating what the company calls ''then the world's second-largest pharmaceutical enterprise.'' Mr. Gelb also oversaw Bristol-Myers's 1967 decision to keep its headquarters in Manhattan at a time when other companies were moving to the suburbs. The company's headquarters is now at 345 Park Avenue. Mr. Gelb was born on June 8, 1924, in New York City to Lawrence M. Gelb and Joan Clair and received a bachelor of arts degree from Yale and a master's degree in business from Harvard. He served in the Army during World War II, then returned to New York and married Phyllis Nason in 1951. Mr. Gelb went to work for the cosmetics company founded by his parents, Clairol. Bristol-Myers acquired Clairol in 1959, and in 1972, he took over as chief executive of Bristol-Myers. He retired from his leadership posts at the company in the mid-90's but continued to be a consultant there, his wife said. Mr. Gelb was fascinated by police work, his wife said, and he helped to found the New York City Police Foundation, a fund-raising organization, with Mayor John V. Lindsay. In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children, Lawrence Gelb, Lucy Sisto, Jane Gelb and James Gelb, and six grandchildren."

37128,"Allan Kornblum, Independent Publisher, Dies at 65","Allan Kornblum, whose love for poetry and printing led him to create Coffee House Press, a leading independent publisher widely respected for finding and nurturing new authors, died on Sunday at his home in St. Paul.","Allan Kornblum, whose love for poetry and printing led him to create Coffee House Press, a leading independent publisher widely respected for finding and nurturing new authors, died on Sunday at his home in St. Paul. He was 65. His wife, Cinda, said the cause was complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He learned he had the disease in 2006. For three decades, Coffee House Press, a nonprofit publisher based in Minneapolis, has been an advocate for poets, novelists and other writers who might have struggled to find another publisher. Many of its authors are women and members of minority groups, often Asian-American. Once obscure, Coffee House has published more than 400 books, and its books are reaching increasingly larger audiences. Coffee House publishes Karen Tei Yamashita, whose 2010 novel, ''I Hotel,'' was a finalist for the National Book Award. It published ''How Long,'' a collection of poems by Ron Padgett that was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2012, and ''Blood Dazzler,'' a book of poems by Patricia Smith that was a finalist for the National Book Award in 2008. Mr. Kornblum did not set out to be a leader in the small-press movement. He dropped out of New York University in the late 1960s and moved to Iowa because he admired the poets at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, including the Finnish immigrant Anselm Hollo. Mr. Kornblum enrolled at the university, but again he dropped out. Instead of studying, he spent most of his time mimeographing a homespun magazine called Toothpaste, which featured the work of local poets. In the early 1970s, Toothpaste magazine became Toothpaste Press, publishing chapbooks of poetry and books printed by hand on a letterpress. Mr. Kornblum was the editor and publisher and did the printing, too, having learned the technique in a typography class. Toothpaste, which published about 100 titles, was among a growing number of independent publishers that emerged in the 1960s and '70s as alternatives to the powerful New York houses. After more than a decade in Iowa City, Mr. Kornblum and his family moved to Minneapolis, where early on he ran the company out of the Minnesota Center for Book Arts. By 1984, he had changed the name of Toothpaste to Coffee House and turned the company into a nonprofit. He also began publishing more trade editions, using more modern printing methods. Among the well-received novels it has released in recent years are ''Firmin: Adventures of a Metropolitan Lowlife,'' by Sam Savage; ''Leaving the Atocha Station,'' by Ben Lerner; and ''A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing,'' by Eimear McBride. Several of Coffee House's more recent successes were acquired under Chris Fischbach, who began as an intern in 1994 and whom Mr. Kornblum groomed to succeed him as publisher, in 2011. Mr. Kornblum became senior editor that year. On Wednesday, Mr. Fischbach said the company's care with book design and typography had been influential. ''One of the reasons it's important in small-press publishing is because of Allan's emphasis early on,'' Mr. Fischbach said. Allan Mark Kornblum was born on Feb. 16, 1949, in Manhattan. His father, Seymour, was a community activist who led several Jewish community centers in the Northeast. His mother, Anne, taught elementary school. Besides his wife of 42 years, the former Cinda Wormley, his survivors include two daughters, Annabel and Gwendolyn, and three sisters, Rena, Phyllis and Freyda. Mr. Kornblum actively sought out new authors. Cinda Kornblum noted that many of the papers and manuscripts he collected were now in the archives of the University of Iowa. ''He started accepting manuscripts and never stopped,'' she said. Sometimes there was no manuscript. Bao Phi, a spoken-word artist who was born in Vietnam, grew up in Minneapolis reading Coffee House authors, but he did not expect to become one. ''I figured I should just be happy with doing shows,'' Mr. Phi wrote on his website this week. ''Allan randomly comes up to me at some literary event, and says to me, 'Why don't you send me your manuscript?' '' Mr. Phi did not have one. ''But because he asked, I put one together, and then suddenly my book was being published by the house that published most of my heroes.'' The book, ''Sng I Sing,'' was published in 2011."

32818,"Lionel Hampton, Who Put Swing In the Vibraphone, Is Dead at 94","Lionel Hampton, whose flamboyant mastery of the vibraphone made him one of the leading figures of the swing era, died yesterday morning at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.","Lionel Hampton, whose flamboyant mastery of the vibraphone made him one of the leading figures of the swing era, died yesterday morning at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 94. The cause was complications of old age and a recent heart attack, said his manager, Phil Leshin. Mr. Hampton, who lived in Manhattan and until recently continued to tour the world with his own immensely popular big band, was an extremely important figure in American music, not only as an entertainer and an improvising musician in jazz, but also because his band helped usher in rock 'n' roll. In 1942, Mr. Hampton recorded one of the more influential recordings in the history of American music, ""Flying Home,"" which featured a honking and shouting solo by the tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet that set the emotional atmosphere for rock. Mr. Hampton performed on piano and drums and was one of the first musicians to play the vibraphone in jazz, on groundbreaking recordings with Louis Armstrong, Benny Carter and Benny Goodman in the 1920's and 30's. Mr. Hampton's harmonically and rhythmically sophisticated performances set the parameters for virtually every vibraphonist to appear since, including Milt Jackson, Bobby Hutcherson and Terry Gibbs. The importance of the collaboration with Mr. Goodman cannot be overstated, on both musical and social grounds. Not only did Mr. Hampton and Mr. Goodman make exceptional music, but they, along with the pianist Teddy Wilson, presented a public, integrated face for jazz. While integration in jazz had been standard practice in back rooms and recording studios, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Hampton were on stage with the most important white group of the time, as featured soloists. But Mr. Hampton's frenetic stage persona -- mouth agape, mallets flying, sweat pouring from his brow -- earned him his following, and he was legendary for not wanting to leave the stage. He truly lived to play. Mr. Hampton was born in Louisville, Ky. His birth certificate says he was born on April 20, 1908, said Mr. Leshin, his manager. Some reference sources and public records give birth dates ranging from 1908 to 1914. After Mr. Hampton was sent to the Holy Rosary Academy in Kenosha, Wis., a school for black and Indian children, he began playing drums in a fife-and-drum band. When his family moved to Chicago, he played in a band made up of newsboys. When he was 14, after receiving a set of drums from his grandparents, Mr. Hampton went on the road with the band leader Detroit Shannon. ""I worked hard learning harmony and theory when I was growing up in Chicago in the 1920's,"" he once recalled. ""I spent hours every day at a music school for boys that had been started by The Chicago Defender, a black newspaper, for their newsboys. ""All those altered scales and harmonic extensions people were calling modern in the 40's and later, I knew all about those before 1930. I was playing the timpani, xylophone and orchestra bells in the school's concert orchestra, taking the flute parts on things like 'Poet and Peasant' Overture and also playing the snare drum in the marching band. Then I would go home, play records by Louis Armstrong and Coleman Hawkins, and learn the trumpet and saxophone solos note for note on the xylophone and orchestra bells."" He moved to Los Angeles in 1927 and found work as a drummer with an early incarnation of Les Hite's orchestra, which became the house band at Frank Sebastian's Cotton Club in Culver City, Calif. It was the band with which Louis Armstrong played on the West Coast, and in 1930 Mr. Armstrong, who used Mr. Hampton on several recordings that year, encouraged him to take up the study of the vibraphone, a metal instrument, similar to a marimba, with electronically operated valves. He played his first recorded vibraphone solo with Mr. Armstrong in 1930, performing ""Memories of You,"" by Eubie Blake and Andy Razaf. Mr. Hampton soon formed his own nine-piece group featuring the trumpeter Buck Clayton and the tenor saxophonist Herschel Evans. Mr. Hampton began attracting a large audience during an engagement at the Paradise, a Los Angeles club. In 1936 Benny Goodman, along with the pianist Teddy Wilson and the drummer Gene Krupa, heard the band and invited Mr. Hampton to record with them. Shortly afterward Mr. Goodman asked Mr. Hampton to join his orchestra. A year later, RCA Victor gave Mr. Hampton free rein in the studio, and he proceeded to make some of the finest small-group recordings of the swing era. He enlisted some of the best musicians playing at the time, including Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Carter, Coleman Hawkins, Chu Berry, Ben Webster and Charlie Christian. These recordings, along with those he made with Benny Goodman, showed Mr. Hampton to be an effusive, swinging soloist who had an affinity for pungent riffs. ""He was good,"" Milt Jackson, the vibraphonist in the Modern Jazz Quartet, said before he died in 1999. ""He inspired me to play the instrument. First, he was the first one of note to play it, but more important, I liked how dynamic he was. And the way he blended with groups and the way he played in front of a band was inspirational."" In 1940, Mr. Hampton formed his own big band. He quickly established himself as a leader by using high-impact arrangements loaded with brass and bluesy pieces that satisfied the postwar audience's hunger for entertainment. Among his biggest hits were ""Flying Home"" and ""Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop."" In Los Angeles, Mr. Hampton's band made its presence felt not only in swing but in early bebop and rhythm and blues. He programmed his shows regularly with boogie-woogie pieces, and his arrangements often quoted popular light classics. It was all an attempt to make concerts and recordings reach out to an audience. Mr. Hampton was an entertainer, and he kept jazz a popular art. As a soloist, he excited audiences with wildly extroverted performances, often moving from vibraphone to drums to piano. Reviewing a 1982 Carnegie Hall concert that reunited Mr. Hampton with Mr. Wilson and Mr. Goodman, John S. Wilson wrote in The New York Times: ""Mr. Hampton still has a way of pitter-pattering across the vibraphone keys that builds a melodic and rhythmic flow that, at times, even seemed to mesmerize him as he looked down at his bouncing mallets, smiling and punctuating his musical phrases with laughing snorts."" He never lost his touch as a talent scout: his bands included Betty Carter, Arnett Cobb, Johnny Griffin, Clifford Brown, Cat Anderson, Charles Mingus, Wes Montgomery, Dexter Gordon, Quincy Jones, Milt Buckner, Thomas Chapin and Terence Blanchard. ""The Hampton band I was part of was one of the most exciting bands I have ever heard in my life,"" Mr. Jacquet once said. ""I was 18 when I joined, and it was like being a freshman in college."" For the next several decades Mr. Hampton relaxed into his role as one of jazz's best-known figures, touring internationally. He recorded often and was a regular at festivals, both as a headliner and as a guest artist. And he was often found at jam sessions. Even in the past decade, Mr. Hampton was sending the competition fleeing. Late one night at a jam session in 1994 at the Iridium near Lincoln Center, Mr. Hampton, playing two-fingered piano, dispatched a series of young musicians, outswinging them with his ferocious solos. In 1975 Mr. Hampton appeared in ""Bette Midler's Clams on the Half Shell Revue"" in New York. His autobiography, ""Hamp"" (Amistad Press), written with James Haskins, was published in 1989. Over several decades, he continued to lead a big band, traveling extensively in Europe and Japan. A longtime Republican, he was active in party affairs, campaigning for, among others, Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush. He was also active in developing housing projects, among them the Gladys Hampton Houses, a low-income complex in Harlem, which was named after his wife, the former Gladys Riddle, who died in 1971. They had no children, and no immediate family members survive. In 1997, a fire that apparently started when a lamp tipped over and ignited a bed destroyed all the belongings in Mr. Hampton's apartment. The blaze forced residents to evacuate the 43-story tower and injured 27 people. It was followed by an outpouring of support and donations, including a new tuxedo so Mr. Hampton could keep an appointment with President Bill Clinton. Some jazz critics and fans who admired Mr. Hampton for his melodic and harmonic imagination, for his interpretations of ""Moonglow"" and ""Dinah"" with Benny Goodman and for his own small-combo recordings, criticized him for his raw blues riffing, a hard backbeat, screaming and honking saxophones and stunts like marching into the audience with his horn players or getting the audience to clap along to his orchestra. ""I learned all that in the sanctified church: the beat, the hand-clapping, marching down the aisles and into the audience,"" Mr. Hampton explained in an interview in 1987. ""When I was 6 or 7 and temporarily living with my grandmother in Birmingham, Ala., she'd take me to the Holiness church services, not just on Sundays but all the time. They'd have a whole band in the church, guitars, trombones, saxophones, drums, and they'd be rocking. I'd be sitting by the sister who was playing the big bass drum, and when she'd get happy and start dancing in the aisle, I'd grab that bass drum and start in on that beat. After that, I always had that beat in me."""

23552,at 80,"Arthur A. Fletcher, a Republican civil rights advocate whose plan in the 1960's requiring the government to enforce timetables and goals in the hiring of minority workers became the framework for affirmative action, died Tuesday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C.","Arthur A. Fletcher, a Republican civil rights advocate whose plan in the 1960's requiring the government to enforce timetables and goals in the hiring of minority workers became the framework for affirmative action, died Tuesday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. He was 80. His son, Paul Fletcher, confirmed the death. Mr. Fletcher, who was an adviser to Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, headed the United States Commission on Civil Rights from 1990 to 1993, under President George Bush. In Kansas in the 1950's, at a time when most black civil rights leaders were Democrats, Mr. Fletcher, the son of a career military man and the son-in-law of a entrepreneur, seemed perfectly at ease pushing for better opportunities for blacks by instituting policies for Republican administrations. Yet his political leanings left other black leaders uneasy, while some white Republicans questioned his support of hiring quotas. Mr. Fletcher favored taking race into account to remedy discrimination as a practical matter, despite its loftier ideal of leveling the playing ground. ''It's not about social justice,'' Mr. Fletcher said at a church assembly in Peoria in 2001, according to The Peoria Journal Star. ''Social justice is nice, but I've got something in my pocket that can buy all the social justice I need.'' A college football star who studied under the G.I. Bill of Rights at Washburn University in Topeka, Kan., Mr. Fletcher was tapped soon after graduating to manage the campaign of Fred Hall, a liberal Republican running for governor, among black voters. Mr. Hall won, and Mr. Fletcher was rewarded with a job overseeing the building and maintenance of Kansas highways. The job, in the 1950's in the middle of a boom in highway building, gave him a firsthand look at how lucrative government contracts were handed out, and Mr. Fletcher took from it a belief that better access to those contracts was a cornerstone for improving the prospects of minorities, his son said. A staunch defender of education, Mr. Fletcher personally helped finance the lawsuit against the Topeka Board of Education in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, which successfully sought to desegregate the Topeka schools. Mr. Fletcher left Kansas after some white business leaders were critical of his efforts to steer contracts to minorities, his son said, and he moved his family to the West Coast. After rocks were thrown into the family's house in a white neighborhood in Sacramento, Calif., they moved to Berkeley; eventually, they settled in Washington State. There, Mr. Fletcher organized a community self-help program in East Pasco, catching the eye of President Nixon, who appointed Mr. Fletcher his assistant secretary of labor, launching his career on the national stage. It was while at the Department of Labor that Mr. Fletcher implemented what became known as the revised Philadelphia Plan, a program to enforce the hiring of minorities by businesses and trade unions contracted by the government. Largely successful, it was later amended to include women. Mr. Fletcher resigned from the Nixon administration in December 1971 to become the executive director of the United Negro College Fund, but stepped down a little over a year later after being at odds with the leaders of the 40 predominantly black schools in the fund, whose trust he had failed to gain as a Republican. But he was lauded for starting a management training program in the fund and beginning a grass-roots effort to include blacks beyond the middle class. In 1968, Mr. Fletcher defeated two white candidates to win the Republican primary for lieutenant governor in Washington State, although he lost the general election by a slim margin. His first wife, Mary Fletcher, died in 1961. In addition to his son, he is survived by his second wife, Bernyce Hassan-Fletcher, and two daughters. Arthur Allen Fletcher was born Dec. 22, 1924, to Andrew and Edna Fletcher, at Camp Huachuca, Ariz., where his father was stationed in the a black cavalry unit. His family moved frequently in his youth, and before settling in Junction City, Kan., where he attended high school, and organized a boycott of the school yearbook, which segregated the photos of black students at the back of the book, his son said. He served in Europe in World War II, was wounded, and discharged in 1945, according to a 1971 biography. He played defensive end for the Baltimore Colts and the Los Angeles Rams before returning to Kansas and beginning his career in politics, his son said. At his talk in Peoria in 2001, Mr. Fletcher told listeners that he suspected that President Nixon appointed him because of his race, an opportunity he said he took gladly. ''The purpose of affirmative action is so that you can do what God intended you to do and be what he intended you to be,'' he said. In his later years, he admonished corporations to help keep affirmative action alive. ''For years business leaders screamed for less government: 'Get out of our way. Let us show you how to get things done,''' he told Fortune Magazine in 2000. ''So Congress redirected money from Washington to cities to states and to the private sector. O.K., corporate America, the ball's in your court, the reins are in your hands.''"

Nosen, a mental patient who mistakenly brought cockroach poison to cooks rather than powdered milk, causing the deaths of 47 Oregon State Hospital patients in 1942, has died after a scuffle at the institution. He was 68 years old. Mr. Nosen was reported to have died Friday after an altercation with a 75- year-old patient. More than 400 patients and employees became ill after a dinner of scrambled eggs on Nov. 18, 1942. It was determined the eggs had been laced with sodium fluoride. Mr. Nosen was found to have inadvertently taken five to six pounds of white, crystalline poison from a trash can instead of the powdered milk stored in a nearby container. Joseph H. Treleaven, the administrator of the State Mental Health Division, said the poisoning probably contributed to major changes at American mental hospitals, which had been criticized after the incident as insufficiently staffed and financed."

He was 74 years old. Allen W. Dulles, the former Director of Central Intelligence who served in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II, once called Mr. von Schlabrendorff ''one of the boldest and bravest of the anti-Nazis.'' Mr. von Schlabrendorff, a constitutional court judge for eight years, was the author of a book on wartime resistance to Hitler in Germany. Mr. von Schlabrendorff was born into a noble Prussian family in Halle, in what is now East Germany, and earned a doctorate in law at the University of Berlin. After World War II he established a law practice in Frankfurt and Wiesbaden, where he lived. He was appointed to the constitutional court in 1967 and served there until his retirement in 1975. In March 1943, after German forces were defeated at Stalingrad, he plotted with other officers to assassinate Hitler by simulating a plane accident. The attempt failed when a bomb that was smuggled onto Hitler's plane disguised as a parcel of brandy bottles failed to go off. He was able to exchange the bomb for a parcel that contained real bottles of brandy and the plot was never discovered. Involved in Another Attempt He later took part in efforts that led to another unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler, this time on July 20, 1944. In the roundup of suspected plotters that followed, he was arrested, tortured by the Gestapo and tried by a Nazi court. Though he was acquitted he was immediately re-arrested and spent the remaining war years in concentration camps. After World War II the right to resist anyone who sought to overthrow the democratic machinery of the state was enshrined in West Germany's Constitution. Though some legal experts have criticized the provision, arguing that political resistance cannot be mandated in a constitution, Mr. von Schlabrendorff always defended it as a symbolic reminder of the need of Germans to avoid blind obedience to the state. ''No one of us knows in what position the Germans may one day again find themselves,'' he warned."
58163,"Bobby Murcer, a Yankee on the Field and in the Broadcast Booth, Dies at 62","Bobby Murcer, the Yankees' All-Star outfielder and longtime broadcaster who never became another Mickey Mantle but endeared himself to Yankee fans in a baseball career of more than four decades, died Saturday in Oklahoma City.","Bobby Murcer, the Yankees' All-Star outfielder and longtime broadcaster who never became another Mickey Mantle but endeared himself to Yankee fans in a baseball career of more than four decades, died Saturday in Oklahoma City. He was 62. Murcer's death, at Mercy Hospital, was announced by the Yankees, who said the cause was complications from brain cancer. Murcer had surgery for a cancerous brain tumor at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston in December 2006 and had received an experimental vaccine in a clinical trial there. He returned as a Yankee broadcaster in May 2007 and broadcast some games this season. His memoir, ''Yankee for Life: My 40-Year Journey in Pinstripes,'' written with Glen Waggoner, was published in May, on his 62nd birthday. When he made his Yankee debut in September 1965 as a teenage shortstop, Murcer evoked images in the press of a young Mantle. Murcer batted left-handed while Mantle was a switch-hitter, but both were Oklahomans, both had been signed by the Yankee scout Tom Greenwade, both possessed speed on the bases, and both had played at shortstop in the minor leagues. But Murcer, at 5 feet 11 inches and 160 pounds, had a slighter build than Mantle. ''Both of us were power hitters, the only difference being that Mickey's power took the ball over the fence a lot more often than mine did,'' Murcer said in his memoir. Murcer eventually succeeded Mantle, his boyhood hero, in center field. He never approached a Hall of Fame career, but he proved an outstanding hitter and a fine fielder in his 17 major league seasons. Playing mostly for the Yankees, Murcer hit 252 home runs and had 1,862 hits and a .277 career batting average. In 1971, he hit a career-high .331 and was the runner-up for the American League batting title, and he became adept at bunting. The next year, Murcer won a Gold Glove award. He was named to five All-Star teams, from 1971 to 1974 while with the Yankees and in 1975 while with the San Francisco Giants. A memorable career moment came on June 24, 1970, when he hit four consecutive home runs in a doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians. Murcer moved to the Yankee broadcast booth, as a commentator, the night of June 20, 1983, hours after George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, offered him the job during his second stint with the Yankees, when he was playing infrequently. He teamed at the outset with Phil Rizzuto, Frank Messer and Bill White and remained a Yankee broadcaster most of the time after that until his death. Murcer recalled how he mangled syntax and offered a few baseball cliches as he learned his craft and how ''one critic sniffed that my Oklahoma accent sounded a bit incongruous.'' But, as he put it, ''I'd spent almost four decades perfecting that accent, and I sure wasn't going to change now.'' As for those early comparisons to Mantle, Murcer once told The New York Times that he did not feel overburdened. ''I was too young and too dumb to realize what they were trying to do in the first place,'' he said, ''and by the time I realized it, I had already established myself.'' Bobby Ray Murcer was born May 20, 1946, in Oklahoma City. His father, Robert, owned several small jewelry stores. Murcer was signed out of high school, and spent two years in the minors before joining a Yankee team that had entered a long decline. After playing briefly with the Yankees for two seasons, then marrying his high school sweetheart, Diana Kay Rhodes (known as Kay), Murcer spent two years in the Army. He became a regular in 1969, when Mantle retired. In 1973, Murcer became the third Yankee, after Joe DiMaggio and Mantle, to receive a $100,000 salary. A year later he became the highest-paid player in Yankee history, with a $120,000 contract. Murcer once recalled that after Steinbrenner gained control of the Yankees in 1973, ''he told me that I was a big part of the Yankee tradition, and always would be.'' But after the 1974 season, the Yankees traded Murcer to the Giants for Bobby Bonds. Murcer spent two seasons in San Francisco and two and a half seasons with the Chicago Cubs. ''What hurt the most was that in the years I was with the Giants and the Cubs, the Yankees won three straight pennants and back-to-back world championships,'' Murcer wrote in his memoir. ''It just ripped my heart out not to have been part of that.'' Murcer was traded back to the Yankees in late June 1979 and emerged as a team spokesman six weeks later when the Yankees' star catcher and captain, his longtime friend Thurman Munson, died in the crash of his small plane. Murcer and his wife stayed up all night with Munson's widow, Diana, in the hours before Munson's funeral -- attended by the Yankees, who flew to Canton, Ohio, from New York -- and Murcer delivered a eulogy. ''We all flew back to Yankee Stadium for a game against Baltimore,'' Murcer recalled in a 1983 article for The Times. ''None of us wanted to play, but we did, and I batted in all five runs and we won, 5-4. I never used that bat again. I sent it to Diana.'' Murcer finally made it to the postseason in 1980, and he played on a World Series team for the first time in 1981, when the Yankees were beaten by the Dodgers. But he had only a part-time role in his second Yankee stint. In addition to his wife, Murcer is survived by a son, Todd; a daughter, Tori Witherspoon; his brother Randy and five grandchildren. In August 1993, Mantle presented Murcer for induction into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame at ceremonies in Oklahoma City. Mantle, who died in 1995, struck an irreverent note at the ceremony. ''The first time I ever heard of Bobby Murcer,'' The Saturday Oklahoman quoted him as saying, ''they said a kid from Oklahoma was gonna be the next Mickey Mantle. They were right. Sure enough, he couldn't play shortstop either.''"

He was 90 years old. A party official said he died at his home of thrombosis. A Sicilian lawyer, Mr. Scelba was named Interior Minister in 1947 by Prime Minister Alcide de Gasperi and remained in the post for six years. He served as Italy's fifth Prime Minister in 1954 and 1955, Christian Democratic party leader in 1966, and President of the European Parliament from 1969 to 1971. Threats From Left and Right As Mr. Scelba took over as Interior Minister, the sparse and ill-equipped police units at his command faced threats of violence from both the left and right. Italy's Communists had been frozen out of the government and the extreme right refused to accept the collapse of Fascism. Mr. Scelba quickly assembled a motorized force with the latest in riot-control equipment and enough manpower to cover the length and breadth of the Italian boot. The definitive test of strength came in 1950 during a nationwide general strike and mounting street clashes. On one day in March 1950, hundreds were wounded, including many policemen, and 7,000 people were arrested. Emerged as Prime Minister Out of office for five months after Mr. de Gasperi's death, Mr. Scelba emerged as Prime Minister in 1954 and led a center-right government for 16 months. He sought strong relations with the United States and helped resolve outstanding wartime issues like the recovery of Trieste for Italy. In June 1955, Mr. Scelba's Government collapsed amid animosities among party factions. A political rival from the party's left wing, Antonio Segni, put together the first of Italy's many center-left coalitions. Although he remained a member of the Italian parliament, Mr. Scelba's right wing of the party never had the strength to command another government. The son of a peasant, Mr. Scelba attended a seminary in his native Caltagirone, an ancient town founded by the Saracens, and studied law in Rome. He began his political career as personal secretary to the Rev. Luigi Sturzo, founder of the Popular Party, a forerunner of the Christian Democrats. The Fascists outlawed the Popular Party but, working underground, Mr. Scelba escaped their attention and helped found the party's newspaper, Il Popolo. In 1945, he won a seat in the postwar Constituent Assembly and entered de Gasperi's Cabinet as Minister of Post and Telecommunications. The names of his survivors were not immediately available."

Atlee Burpee, the descendant of a family of Huguenots who moved to Philadelphia from Canada. The father began his venture in the seed trade by opening a small store in suburban Warminster in 1876. The younger Burpee took over the company in 1915, when he was 22 and had had only a few months' study in horticulture. Always Something New As a seed merchant he always made a point of having something new in his annual catalogue. Hybrid tomatoes and cucumbers were among the new listings. The hybrid vegetables, which were hardier, more disease resistant and higher yielding than others, helped Victory Gardeners raise bumper crops in World War II. In the 1920's, sweet peas were the company's biggest seller in flower seeds but root disease reduced their hardiness and Mr. Burpee looked to the marigold as a substitute. However, the plant did not become popular because of its kerosene-like smell, and an intense research program was started to produce a more acceptable flower. Just as the program seemed a failure, a missionary in Tibet sent a sampling of seeds from which a golden-orange and ordorless marigold was developed. The bloom was named the Crown of Gold. Mr. Burpee also sought to develop a white marigold and in 1954 offered a $10,000 prize for a seed that would produce one. The prize was given to Alice Vonk of Sully, Iowa, 21 years later. Registered as Marigold Lobbyist In 1959 Mr. Burpee began an unsuccessful campaign to have the marigold, which he called ''A flower of all the people,'' declared the national flower. It was, he said, ''a symbol of the desire of the United States for peace and friendship with all the peoples of the world.'' He even registered in Washington as a lobbyist to promote the marigold's cause. As a 10-year-old he had his first taste of the business picking sage seeds on the family's Fordhook Farm for 5 cents an hour. He attended Culver Military Academy and was a student at Cornell University when he was called to succeed his father. One of his merchandizing ideas was the naming of a new flower each year after some well-known person such as Mrs. Douglas MacArthur, Pearl Buck, Kate Smith and Helen Hayes. Business Sold in 1970 Mr. Burpee sent out as many as four million copies of his seed catalogues annually. Also, each year just before catalogue time, he ''unveiled'' his newest seed offering at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. As many as 4,000 people would attend - horticulturists, garden club members and the press, all bearing engraved invitations - who would hear from him the story of the creation of a new hybrid flower or vegetable. Mr. Burpee sold the business to the General Foods Corporation in 1970 but remained as a consultant. In 1979, the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation bought the company. Mr. Burpee lived at Fordhook Farm, his 500-acre boyhod home which was also an experimmental center. He received many honors, including the American Horticultural Society's highest award, the Liberty Hyde Bailey Medal. Mr. Burpee once explained his love for gardening in these"

38893,"Max Frisch, 79, Writer, Is Dead In Switzerland","Max Frisch, the Swiss novelist, dramatist and essayist, died yesterday at his home outside Zurich.","Max Frisch, the Swiss novelist, dramatist and essayist, died yesterday at his home outside Zurich. He was 79 years old. He died of cancer, his son, Hans Peter Frisch, told the Associated Press. A major theme of Mr. Frisch's fiction was the individual's struggle to retain his or her identity in a world of shifting values, totalitarian ideologies and technological revolutions. His writings are multilayered structures, full of parables and ironies. His works, written over half a century and translated into more than 20 languages, include the novels ""I'm Not Stiller"" (1958), ""Homo Faber"" (1959), ""A Wilderness of Mirrors"" (1966) and ""Man in the Holocene"" (1980); diaries like ""Sketchbook 1946-1949"" and ""Sketchbook 1966-1971""; and the plays ""The Firebugs"" and ""Andorra."" There were productions of ""The Firebugs"" in New York City in 1963 and 1975 and one of ""Andorra"" in 1963. Praised for Variety of Style Over the years, his best works were praised by reviewers for their variety and originality of style, for lucidity and elegance of form, and for restraint and universality. George Stade, a writer and teacher at Columbia University, said in a 1980 appraisal of Mr. Frisch's works in The New York Times Book Review that each of the plays ""has its moral, in the sense that the problem it poses, in theory at least, is capable of solution."" ""The problem,"" Professor Stade wrote, ""is some sort of political or social aberration; the moral is that we better do something about it."" Professor Stade also noted that each of the novels ""has as its central character either someone who tries to escape from himself or who writhes in the nets of definition others cast over him or who finds out, too late, that he is not what he took himself to be."" He hailed Mr. Frisch's ""Man in the Holocene,"" which recounted the slow, inexorable decline into senility of a 74-year-old widower, as a ""luminous parable of indeterminable purport"" and ""a masterpiece."" An Answer to Critics Some reviewers criticized Mr. Frisch's writing as pessimistic and negative. The writer offered this rebuttal in an interview in The New York Times in 1981: ""I believe it is much more negative not to suffer by not showing those things, because if you suffer, it means that you will want something else in life, something more. Praising things as they are is just giving in."" For many years, Mr. Frisch was considered a leading candidate for the Nobel Prize. That award eluded him, but his many honors included the 1985 Common Wealth Award by a jury of the Modern Language Association and the 1986 Neustadt International Prize for Literature by jurors from nine countries. Max Rudolf Frisch, the son of an architect, was born in Zurich on May 15, 1911. He studied literature at Zurich University and architecture at the Zurich Institute of Technology. He was a foreign correspondent for several newspapers in Europe and the Middle East, then practiced architecture in Zurich until the mid-1950's, when his first fiction successes allowed him to write full time. Mr. Frisch, who served in neutral Switzerland's army during World War II, termed himself a socialist but never joined the political party, deriding it as ""too well-behaved."" He aroused controversy among fellow Swiss for terming them timid and unadventureous. In his novel ""I'm Not Stiller,"" he taunted his countrymen for ""fear of the future, fear of one day being poor, fear of life."" In contrast, he had high praise for New York City, where he lived in the early 1950's while writing ""I'm Not Stiller"" with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, and later, from 1980 to 1983. He was exhilarated by New York and by a sense of discovering a new world, observing, ""It is stimulating for me because it condenses all the problems of our times."" In New York, he said, ""every invented story is possible."" Mr. Frisch, who also lived in Rome for awhile, described himself as a religious skeptic. When asked once to correct any errors that had been published about him, he replied, ""Fame is based on misstatements, so you should not correct them."" He was married and divorced twice. His survivors, besides his son, include two daughters, Ursula and Charlotte."

21063,"David E. Durston, 88; Wrote and Directed 'I Drink Your Blood'",Men become animals and eat their victims! ... You will sit and watch this shocking ugliness splashing across the screen!,"Men become animals and eat their victims! ... You will sit and watch this shocking ugliness splashing across the screen! ... Can you take it? ... So goes the trailer for ''I Drink Your Blood.'' Widely released in 1971, the film has endured for four decades as a sanguinary cult classic. A staple of drive-ins and grindhouses nationwide, it is the picture for which its writer and director, David E. Durston, is best known. Mr. Durston died on May 6 at 88. The death, at his home in West Hollywood, Calif., was of complications of pneumonia, his companion, John DiBello, said. ''I Drink Your Blood'' stars the Indian actor and dancer Bhaskar Roy Chowdhury as Horace Bones, the Mansonlike leader of a satanic hippie cult. Its plot is roughly this: Hippies descend on small town and do mean things to townsfolk. Boy tries to stop them by lacing meat pies with blood of rabid dog. Plan backfires: Hippies eat pies and become rabid zombies. Many townspeople also eaten. In the course of the film, nearly every human appendage that can be severed is, on camera. Threatened with an X rating for violence, Mr. Durston made cuts to obtain an R. ''The cuts were basically scenes of chopping off a head -- things like that,'' Mr. DiBello said amiably on Wednesday. Mr. Durston hoped to call his film ''Blood Phobia''; the final title, foisted on the picture by a distributor, humiliated him, Mr. DiBello said. But perhaps the title was the secret of the film's staying power -- all the more so as it let ''I Drink Your Blood'' be routinely double-billed with ''I Eat Your Skin,'' which had been specially retitled for the occasion. (Written and directed by Del Tenney, ''I Eat Your Skin'' had been made in 1964 as ''Zombies,'' a k a ''Voodoo Blood Bath.'') Few mainstream newspapers reviewed ''I Drink Your Blood.'' The New York Times did, however, heap praise on one of Mr. Durston's later films, ''Stigma'' (1972), a cautionary drama about venereal disease. The film starred a young Philip Michael Thomas, better known afterward for playing Detective Ricardo Tubbs on the television series ''Miami Vice.'' Reviewing ''Stigma'' in The Times, Howard Thompson called it ''not a luridly flapping sermon but a crackling good suspense melodrama.'' David Edward Durston was born in Pennsylvania on Sept. 10, 1921. He began his career as an actor in regional theaters; while serving in World War II he appeared in ''Winged Victory,'' the Moss Hart drama produced by the Army Air Forces, which played on Broadway from 1943 to 1944. In the 1950s, Mr. Durston was an associate producer of the television show ''Your Hit Parade.'' He also wrote scripts for the early science-fiction anthology ''Tales of Tomorrow'' and other shows. Mr. Durston's other films as a writer and director include ''Felicia'' (1964), ''The Love Statue'' (1965) and ''The Blue Sextet'' (1971); he also directed several gay pornographic pictures. In later years he was a freelance director and script doctor. A brief early marriage of Mr. Durston's ended in divorce. Mr. DiBello, an actor and producer known professionally as Jack Damon, is his only immediate survivor. A few years ago, the distributor Grindhouse Releasing issued Mr. Durston's uncut version of ''I Drink Your Blood'' on DVD. The uncensored film is like the original, only more so."

Nordstrom, a former co-chairman of the Nordstrom department store chain, died Sunday at Swedish Hospital in Seattle. He was 88. He died of complications from pneumonia, said a Nordstrom spokeswoman, Kellie Tormey. Mr. Nordstrom had been a co-chairman of the company with his brothers Everett and Lloyd until the three retired in the late 1960's. Both brothers died before him. The company began as a small shoe store opened in 1901 by their father, John W. Nordstrom, and his partner, Carl Wallin. Elmer Nordstrom and his brothers bought out their father and Mr. Wallin in 1928. 72 Stores in 11 States Under the brothers' direction, Nordstrom Inc. became the largest single shoe store in the country, the company said. The chain had grown to 10 stores in the Pacific Northwest by the time Elmer Nordstrom retired. There are now 72 stores in 11 states, with full clothing lines and other items. Elmer Nordstrom maintained an active interest in the company, working in his downtown office as recently as last week, the company said. He was also the majority ownership representative for the Seahawks football team during the first six years of its National Football League franchise from 1976 to 1982. The franchise was sold to Ken Behring, a California real estate developer, in 1988. Mr. Nordstrom also served for 57 years on the board of Swedish Hospital, which was founded in 1908 by his future father-in-law, and on the boards of several corporations and not-for-profit organizations. He is survived by his wife, the former Katherine Johanson, two sons and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
38700,"Pierre Bourdieu, 71, French Thinker and Globalization Critic","Pierre Bourdieu, a leading French sociologist and maverick intellectual who emerged as a public figure here in the 1990's by championing the antiglobalization movement and other antiestablishment causes, died in a Paris hospital on Wednesday.","PARIS, Jan. 24 Pierre Bourdieu, a leading French sociologist and maverick intellectual who emerged as a public figure here in the 1990's by championing the antiglobalization movement and other antiestablishment causes, died in a Paris hospital on Wednesday. He was 71. The cause was cancer, friends said. The author of 25 books, many translated into English, Mr. Bourdieu was particularly interested in exploring the formative roots of class distinctions and power structures. He applied his theories to a broad range of topics, including education, television, masculinity, intellectuals, the media, language and poverty. While his influence has long been felt in academic circles in France and the United States, Mr. Bourdieu assumed a public role in the tradition of Emile Zola and Jean-Paul Sartre only in the last decade, when he became what Le Monde called ""the intellectual reference"" for movements opposed to free market orthodoxy and globalization. In the process, he also turned his guns on television talk-show hosts for delivering ""cultural fast food"" and on many fellow intellectuals whom he accused of abusing their privileged status in France by opining on issues about which they knew little. Counterattacks by intellectuals like Alain Finkelkraut and BernardHenry Levi ensured that he remained in the public eye. Some critics said that he had grown increasingly sectarian in recent years. Yet while he described his political position as ""to the left of the left,"" meaning that he considered the Socialist Party to have sold out, he stood at the heart of France's intellectual establishment. He held the chair of sociology at the College de France, an elite government-backed think tank, he taught at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and he edited a sociology journal. One measure of his iconoclastic renown in France was that the report of his death was the lead story in Le Monde. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, himself a Socialist, described Mr. Bourdieu as a master of contemporary sociology and said that ""his works made him the leader of a school of thought that applied incisive criticism to the capitalist society."" One of Mr. Bourdieu's central theses was that social and cultural breeding were critical to achieving status and power, but his own life's story suggested that, at least for some, France could work as a meritocracy. Born on Aug. 1, 1930, in Denguin in the foothills of the Pyrenees, Mr. Bourdieu had a peasant farmer-turned-postman as a father. Gascon, now a moribund regional dialect, was spoken at home. Young Pierre nonetheless proved a bright student, attending the region's best high school before gaining entrance to the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, the traditional cradle of French intellectuals, where he studied philosophy before turning to sociology. Although he graduated at the top of his class, he felt something of an outsider as a poor man surrounded by children of the French elite, and that feeling continued even as he became part of the French intelligentsia. ""A lot of what I've done has been in reaction to the Ecole Normale,"" he said in an interview with The New York Times a year ago. ""I think if I hadn't become a sociologist, I would have become very anti-intellectual. I was horrified by that world."" Beginning in 1958 he taught for two years at the University of Algiers just as the Algerian war for independence from France was gaining momentum. From this experience emerged his first book, ""The Sociology of Algeria."" After returning to France to teach in Lille and Paris, he married the former Marie-Claire Brisard in 1962. She and their children, Jerome, Emmanuel and Laurent, survive him. Later, while assuming an ever more prominent role as a sociology teacher, he stepped up the pace of his publications. ""Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste,"" published in France in 1979 and in the United States in 1984, was named one of the 20th century's 10 most important works of sociology by the International Sociological Association. Among his other influential works are ""State Nobility: Elite Schools in the Field of Power,"" ""Homo Academicus,"" ""Pascalian Meditations,"" ""On Television"" and ""The Weight of the World: Social Suffering in Contemporary Societies,"" which he edited. A soft-spoken man who seemed to enjoy provoking other intellectuals, Mr. Bourdieu had a fatalistic view of the social and economic possibilities available to most people, believing that they entered adulthood with the experiences that would determine their success or failure. ""The point of my work is to show that culture and education aren't simply hobbies or minor influences,"" he told The Times. ""They are hugely important in the affirmation of differences between groups and social classes and in the reproduction of those differences."" Persuaded that most people in France did not have a fair chance to rise in society, he came to favor the underdog, above all those fighting against perceived injustices wrought by unfettered capitalism. Among those whom he supported was Jose Bove, who gained fame in 1999 by leading small farmers in France on an attack against McDonald's. Today, Mr. Bove was among those remembering Mr. Bourdieu warmly. ""For him,"" Mr. Bove said, ""life itself was a commitment."""

23021,An Enduring Pillar From Israel's Founding Era,"Shimon Peres, one of the last surviving pillars of Israel's founding generation, who did more than anyone to build up his country's formidable military might, then worked as hard to establish a lasting peace with Israel's Arab neighbors, died on Wednesday in a Tel Aviv area hospital.","Shimon Peres, one of the last surviving pillars of Israel's founding generation, who did more than anyone to build up his country's formidable military might, then worked as hard to establish a lasting peace with Israel's Arab neighbors, died on Wednesday in a Tel Aviv area hospital. He was 93. His death was announced by his son Nehemya Peres, who is known as Chemi, and his personal physician and son-in-law Dr. Rafi Walden, outside the Sheba Medical Center, where he had been hospitalized for the last two weeks. Mr. Peres died just over two weeks after suffering a stroke. Doctors kept him largely unconscious and on a breathing tube since then in the hope that it would give his brain a chance to heal. But he deteriorated as the nation he once led watched his last battle play out publicly and as leaders from around the world sent wishes for his recovery. As prime minister (twice); as minister of defense, foreign affairs, finance and transportation; and, until 2014, as president, Mr. Peres never left the public stage during Israel's seven decades. He led the creation of Israel's defense industry, negotiated key arms deals with France and Germany and was the prime mover behind the development of Israel's nuclear weapons. But he was consistent in his search for an accommodation with the Arab world, a search that in recent years left him orphaned as Israeli society lost interest, especially after the upheavals of the 2011 Arab Spring led to tumult on its borders. Chosen by Parliament in 2007 to serve a seven-year term as president, Mr. Peres had complicated relations with the hawkish government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, elected in 2009. While largely a ceremonial post, the presidency afforded Mr. Peres a perch with access and public attention, and he tried to exert his influence. For someone who was dogged for decades by a reputation for vanity and back-room dealing, Mr. Peres ended his years in public office as a remarkably beloved figure, a founding pioneer who set an example for forward thinking by promoting the country's high-tech prowess and cultural reach. Never at a loss for a bon mot in his Polish-accented Hebrew, English and French, Mr. Peres said of his transformation: ''For 60 years I was the most controversial figure in the country, and suddenly I'm the most popular man in the land. Truth be told, I don't know when I was happier, then or now.'' Historic Handshake In his efforts to help Israel find acceptance in a hostile region, Mr. Peres's biggest breakthrough came in 1993, when he worked out a plan with the Palestine Liberation Organization for self-government in Gaza and in part of the West Bank, both of which were occupied by Israel. After months of secret negotiation with representatives of the P.L.O., conducted with the help of Norwegian diplomats and intellectuals, Mr. Peres persuaded his old political rival Yitzhak Rabin, then the prime minister, to accept the plan. It became known as the Oslo Accords. Mr. Peres, who was serving as foreign minister, overview-rabin-arafat-seal-their-accord-clinton-applauds-brave.html"">signed the accords on Sept. 13, 1993, in a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House as Mr. Rabin and their old enemy Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the P.L.O., looked on and, with some prodding by President Bill Clinton, shook hands. It was a gesture both unprecedented and historic. Up to that time, Israel had refused to negotiate directly with the P.L.O. Mr. Peres broke the taboo, and the impasse. ''What we are doing today is more than signing an agreement; it is a revolution,'' he said at the ceremony. ''Yesterday a dream, today a commitment.'' ''We are sincere,'' he pledged to the Palestinians. ''We mean business. We do not seek to shape your lives or determine your destiny. Let all of us turn from bullets to ballots, from guns to shovels.'' Later that day, in a television interview, Mr. Peres pronounced himself 100 percent sure that peace had arrived. With the changes in the world -- the end of the Cold War; the collapse of the Soviet Union and with it its military, financial and diplomatic support of the P.L.O.; and the drying up of funds from Arab countries angered over Arafat's support of Iraq in the recent Persian Gulf war -- the time had come for the Palestinians, too, to seek peace. ''If you have children,'' he said, ''you cannot feed them forever with flags for breakfast and cartridges for lunch. You need something more substantial. Unless you educate your children and spend less money on conflicts, unless you develop your science, technology and industry, you don't have a future.'' Mr. Peres, Mr. Rabin and Arafat were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994. But the era of good feelings did not last. Barely a year later, Mr. Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish gunman upset by the accords; the death elevated Mr. Peres to the post of prime minister. But a series of Palestinian suicide bombings undercut Mr. Peres's authority, and he lost a narrow election to Mr. Netanyahu in 1996. Conflict between Israel and the Palestinians accelerated in 2000 after a visit by the opposition leader Ariel Sharon to the sacred plaza in Jerusalem known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. The next day, the Israeli police fired on stone-throwing protesters, inaugurating a new round of violence that became known as the second intifada. It did not end until Arafat died in 2004, bringing new leadership to the Palestinians and a new effort at coexistence led by Mr. Sharon, a former hawk who had been elected prime minister. He withdrew Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza and small parts of the West Bank. Mr. Peres had tried before to get a peace settlement, in 1987, between Israel and Jordan. He was foreign minister in a coalition government with Yitzhak Shamir when he proposed an international peace conference on the Middle East. But Mr. Shamir and his Likud faction scuttled the plan. Mr. Peres had sought to settle the future of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel had occupied since the Arab-Israeli War in 1967. As a first step, he proposed that Jordan and Israel could either divide the land or share the government but that Israel should not control the area forever. A Coalition, and Calm Mr. Peres became prime minister at the head of an unusual coalition of Israel's two major political parties, his own Labor Party, and the Likud, the party led by Yitzhak Shamir, who served as deputy prime minister and foreign minister. In accordance with the coalition agreement, the two men exchanged posts after 25 months. Mr. Peres brought a period of tranquillity to the social environment, which had been frayed by animosities between European and Middle Eastern Jews and between religious Jews and secular Jews. He presided over the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon after an invasion that had generated unprecedented controversy, and he became the first Israeli prime minister to take the difficult steps required to deal with the nation's fundamental economic problems and ruinous inflation. During his time in office, Israel airlifted some 7,000 Ethiopian Jews who had trekked to refugee camps in Sudan to escape famine, anti-Semitism, forced conscription of boys and other threats that had made their lives in Ethiopia precarious. Mr. Peres called the clandestine rescue operation a ''daring and wonderful'' act of ''self-redemption.'' Taking over what was expected to be a government of national impasse, Mr. Peres left office with an image as a dignified, self-confident statesman. But while he was prime minister, severe strains developed in relations between the United States and Israel growing out of a major spy scandal involving an American, Jonathan Jay Pollard, and the disclosure in 1986 of Iranian arms deals. A man of medium height and slender, athletic build -- his dark hair turned gray and then white in his later years -- Mr. Peres always exuded vitality, despite a schedule that kept him going 18 hours a day. When, on his 88th birthday, he was offered a traditional Jewish greeting, ''May you live till 120,'' he retorted without missing a beat, ''Don't be stingy.'' Mr. Peres was married to the former Sonya Gelman, who shunned the spotlight to the point of refusing to move into the president's house when he took his last public post. She died in January 2011. They had three children: a daughter, Zvia, and two sons, Jonathan and Nehemya. They and Mr. Peres's eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive him. Mr. Peres was an effective speaker, comfortable in front of large audiences as well as the television camera. He cultivated party members -- remembering their names and attending their weddings and bar mitzvahs -- and nurtured his relationship with the intelligentsia. He also wrote poetry and was given to quoting the ancient Greeks and Flaubert and Churchill. He published a dozen books, including ''The New Middle East,'' in 1993, and ''Battling for Peace,'' a memoir, in 1995. His last book was an affectionate political biography of his mentor, the country's founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion. A Journey From Poland He was born Shimon Persky on Aug. 16, 1923, to a merchant family in the small village of Vishniewa, Poland. His parents, Yitzhak and Sara Persky, took him to Palestine when he was 11, where he studied in Tel Aviv and then entered an agricultural school. In 1941, he helped found Kibbutz Alumot in the eastern Lower Galilee, where he worked as a herdsman and was elected kibbutz secretary. He soon became active in the Mapai, which was to become Israel's Labor Party, and at 18 was appointed the coordinator of the youth movement of the Histadrut, the General Labor Federation. He rose rapidly, getting experience in the intricacies of Israeli political life. In 1944, Ben-Gurion, then the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, sent Mr. Peres with a small reconnaissance group to Eilat on the Red Sea to survey the Sinai Desert and make maps, which became important strategic assets during the 1948 war of independence. It was on that mission that a friend sighted a nest of eagles, ''peres'' in Hebrew. ''Persky,'' he said, ''why don't you change your family name to Peres?'' He accepted the suggestion, though the bird they saw was in fact more a vulture than an eagle. When Israel became independent in 1948, Mr. Peres was named head of the naval service. Within two years, he was sent to the United States to lead a defense supply mission in New York. He was 27 and spoke no English, but within three months, after rounds of intensive private lessons, he was fluent. He took courses at the New School for Social Research and New York University, and later at the Harvard School of Public Administration. In 1951, Ben-Gurion, then prime minister and minister of defense, appointed Mr. Peres director general of the Defense Ministry, where he used his Harvard training to reorganize the department. Mr. Peres became known as one of ''Ben-Gurion's boys'' -- protgs of the ''Old Man'' -- a group that included Teddy Kollek and Moshe Dayan. Those years may have been the genesis of a lifelong rivalry with Mr. Rabin, who at the time was chief of the operations branch, the second-highest position in the Israeli Army. He complained of what he called Mr. Peres's excessive authority. At the Defense Ministry, Mr. Peres was in charge of a substantial portion of the nation's total budget, and he played a central role in developing the young nation's industry, particularly in aeronautics and electronics. He stressed domestic weapons production, but when Egypt received advanced military equipment from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, Mr. Peres began to cast about for new sources of supply. He finally turned to France. His timing was excellent. The French believed the Algerian revolutionaries fighting for independence were fueled by President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and saw Israel as a source of intelligence about Egypt. Mr. Peres negotiated a $1 billion arms deal and acquired a reputation as a canny bargainer. The arms negotiations formed a basis for the Franco-Israeli alliance that led to Israel's lightning capture of Sinai in 1956. Zeev Schiff, for many years the military editor of the newspaper Haaretz, said, ''There is no doubt that Peres was one of the brains behind Suez.'' Ben-Gurion felt that a pre-emptive war was bad for Israel in terms of public opinion and was reluctant until the last. Mr. Peres saw it as an opportunity to get a better position among the superpowers, a special relationship through a ''joint venture of going to war together.'' Out of that joint venture came French help in building a nuclear reactor in Dimona, which provided Israel with the ability to build nuclear weapons. ''I reached the stage in France where I was trusted by everybody, and really the sky was the limit,'' Mr. Peres said many years later. Power Struggles In 1957, Mr. Peres was awarded the French Legion of Honor, one of many international distinctions. In 2012, President Obama presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The American honor partly reflected Israel's shift in alliance to the United States from Europe in previous decades. While under Ben-Gurion, and his successor, Levi Eshkol, Mr. Peres had negotiated with the West German defense minister, Franz Josef Strauss, to get arms and continued to get weapons from France as well. But he came to rely increasingly on the United States. He visited Washington frequently and met with Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Mr. Peres ran for the country's Parliament, the Knesset, in 1959, in his first bid for national elective office. With the support of Ben-Gurion, he was given a position high enough on his party's electoral list to be assured of victory. In the political turmoil that preceded the 1967 Middle East War, Mr. Peres tried to negotiate a return to power for Ben-Gurion, who had retired. In the course of his negotiations, he proposed a coalition to Menachem Begin, the head of the right-wing Herut Party, despite Ben-Gurion's belief that if Mr. Begin ever came to power, he would bring Israel to the ''precipice of destruction.'' Shabtai Teveth, a professor of history at Tel Aviv University and the biographer of Ben-Gurion, said in an interview, ''I believe Peres will go down in Zionist and Israeli history as the man who legitimized Begin and the Herut.'' Ten years later, in 1977, when Mr. Peres challenged Mr. Rabin, the split in the Labor Party opened the way for the election of Mr. Begin as prime minister. When Israel's top leaders were discredited because of the country's lack of preparedness for the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Mr. Peres made a bid for power. To block him, Finance Minister Pinchas Sapir recruited Mr. Rabin, who had been ambassador to the United States and bore no responsibility for the wartime failures. Mr. Rabin named Mr. Peres defense minister, a decision he later came to regret. In his memoirs, Mr. Rabin called him unscrupulous and untrustworthy. He wrote that he could not believe a word Mr. Peres said. Their decades-old feud flared again in 1976 when an Air France plane that left Tel Aviv for Paris was hijacked in Athens and taken to Entebbe, Uganda. The hijackers held about 100 Israeli passengers hostage. Mr. Peres accused Prime Minister Rabin of weakness for resisting a military solution. A raid by Israeli commandos on July 3, 1976, rescued 91 passengers and 12 crew members. The next year, Mr. Peres again sought nomination as his party's candidate for prime minister, but he again lost out to Mr. Rabin. When Mr. Rabin was forced to drop out after disclosures that he and his wife had violated Israeli law by maintaining a bank account in Washington, Mr. Peres led the party, but he lost in the general election to Mr. Begin. Mr. Peres finally became prime minister in 1984 when he led his Labor Party into the coalition with Likud. He returned to office as foreign minister in July 1992 in the government of Mr. Rabin and was soon working toward the accord signed a year later. In 1996, Mr. Peres, who had taken over as prime minister after Mr. Rabin's assassination, called an early election, certain of victory. But a series of terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and Mr. Peres's decision to mount an offensive against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon -- during which scores of Lebanese refugees sheltering at a United Nations base in Qana died in an Israeli artillery barrage -- led to ill feelings in Israel and the surprise victory by Mr. Netanyahu of Likud. Ehud Barak then replaced Mr. Peres as head of Labor and kept him in a minor role in his government, which was elected in 1999. Mr. Peres spent that period partly building up his Peres Center for Peace but made another political comeback when Mr. Sharon was elected prime minister in 2001 over Mr. Barak. Mr. Peres took Labor into the Sharon-led government in a bid for national unity. Later, in 2005, he left Labor and joined the new centrist party, Kadima, formed by Mr. Sharon. Mr. Peres, who frequently drew on historical allusions, thought of himself as a philosopher more than a politician. When asked about the 1993 Oslo Accords, he said: ''There was no alternative. We had to do it.'' He added, ''An ancient Greek philosopher was asked what is the difference between war and peace. 'In war,' he replied, 'the old bury the young. In peace, the young bury the old.' I felt that if I could make the world better for the young, that would be the greatest thing we can do.''"

He was 86. Dr. Guerard was a professor emeritus of literature at Stanford, where he taught from 1961 until 1985. A man of many interests, he developed the university's first freshman seminar program and its Voice Project, which attracted well-known writers to teach freshmen classes. Asked once how one teaches creative writing, Dr. Guerard said there were no techniques, tricks or formulas for success; it was an empirical process. ""Every genuine writer has a voice of his own -- an inward voice that stems from his temperament as well as from experience,"" he said. ""The experienced teacher listens to that voice, helps bring it out."" Ms. Hoffman, the novelist, went to Stanford on a scholarship in the 1970's. ""I was lucky,"" she told an interviewer in 1994. ""I had Albert Guerard, one of the greatest writing teachers in the country. He just opened the world up."" Dr. Guerard published nine novels, six books of criticism and a memoir, ""The Touch of Time: Myth, Memory and the Self"" (1980), along with critical essays and book reviews. At his death he was preparing a volume of his critical writing for publication, a colleague, Prof. Thomas Moser, said. His novels included ""Maquisard: A Christmas Tale"" (1945) and ""Night Journey"" (1950), which reflected his experience with Army intelligence in World War II. ""The Exiles"" (1963) dealt with political skulduggery in the Caribbean, and his latest, ""The Hotel in the Jungle"" (1996), mixed history with fiction in a tale set at a resort in Mexico. His books of criticism included ""Thomas Hardy: The Novels and Stories"" (1949), ""Andre Gide"" (1951, revised in 1969), ""Conrad the Novelist"" (1958) and ""The Triumph of the Novel: Dickens, Dostoyevsky, Faulkner"" (1976). He also contributed short stories to periodicals. A collection of his manuscripts is in the Stanford University Library. Albert Guerard was born in Houston and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford in 1934. (His father, Albert Leon Guerard, was also a writer and an authority on French literature and history.) He received a master's at Harvard University in 1936 and a doctorate at Stanford two years later. He was on the Harvard faculty from 1938 to 1961, rising from instructor to professor before returning to Stanford for good. Dr. Guerard is survived by his wife, Maclin Bocock Guerard, a short-story writer; three daughters: Collot, of Washington, Maclin, of Santa Rosa, Calif. and Lundie, of Boulder, Colo.; and three grandchildren. The critic John Simon called his former tutor at Harvard ""a vastly underestimated figure on our cultural horizon."" Speaking to The Associated Press when ""The Hotel"" was published, he said of Mr. Guerard: ""It would be nice if, however belatedly, he were recognized for his body of work. He's one of those people that everybody has read a little of."" http://www.nytimes.com"
7174,Hebe Dorsey Dies in France at 62; Fashion Writer at Herald Tribune,"Hebe Dorsey, the fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune and a major figure in the fashion world, died of cancer yesterday morning at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris.","Hebe Dorsey, the fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune and a major figure in the fashion world, died of cancer yesterday morning at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. She was 62 years old and had been working for the paper for about 40 years. Known for her irreverence and for fascination with society, Mrs. Dorsey frequently combined fashion and social reporting, and was in fact a member of the international social set herself. A witty and somewhat acerbic commentator, Mrs. Dorsey was a force in fashion circles in New York and Tokyo as well as Paris. ''She had the courage to report fashion critically,'' said Bill Blass, the designer, who remembered meeting her soon after World War II in Paris with Art Buchwald and other Tribune contributors. She was somewhat blase in those days, and she never really changed her attitude, he said. ''She liked the social aspects of fashion and she drew the connection between the two worlds,'' he added. Hebe (pronounced ay-bay) Dorsey was born March 5, 1925, in Sousse, Tunisia, one of five children of Mary and Clement Halfon. After attending a French high school, she went on to study English and French at the Sorbonne. She became a contributor to The Herald Tribune when it was the European edition of The New York Herald Tribune. At about the same time, she married Frank Dorsey, a copy editor there, according to her brother, Leon Halfon. They were divorced some years ago. Award From Fashion Group Earlier this fall she was one of five nominees for the journalism award given by the French Federation of Couture Ready to Wear and Creators of Fashion, an organization of trade groups. On Jan. 11, she was to receive an award for international journalism from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in New York. ''She had an appointment next week to be fitted for the dress she was planning to wear,'' Mr. Blass said. ''It was a simple little short red satin strapless dress trimmed in fake leopard.'' Christian Lacroix said he would miss ''her sharpness, her acute sense of analysis and her style.'' She had ''helped launch us,'' France's newest couturier said, and he was happy that she was in New York in October when the first showing of his fashions was held in this country. Mrs. Dorsey was one of the first women to be seen in a Lacroix design, turning up at parties in his strapless red pouf-skirt dress. 'The Girl From Tunis' ''I think of her as the girl from Tunis who was so involved with her family,'' Mr. Lacroix said, ''not of the dragon-like editor who was so intimidating at the fashion shows.'' He had lunch with her 10 days ago at the Ritz in Paris. ''She was wearing a Valentino suit with a fox collar and all her diamonds - she was in great spirits.'' Mrs. Dorsey generally wore clothes from such French couture houses as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Lacroix, but would occasionally turn up in, say, a blue denim suit by an unknown tailor. She was also interested in jewelry and decorating. ''Hebe revolutionized fashion writing,'' said John Fairchild, chairman of Fairchild Publications. ''She invented the idea of reviewing fashion like a play and she always did it with a razor, not a knife.'' John Vinocur, executive editor of The Herald Tribune, called her ''loyal, fierce, enormously generous and wildly funny.'' He said she could be ''enormously entertaining in two languages,'' switching from French to English ''without losing an ounce of wit.'' Streak of Irreverence Her irreverence is illustrated by the article she wrote a few years ago after being bannned from a Christian Dior fashion show for an unfavorable review of the house's previous collection. Instead of lamenting the ban, she described using the free time to have her hair done, go shopping and take care of other chores she would not otherwise have had time for. She entertained lavishly, both in her large apartment on the Boulevard Malesherbes in Paris and her pied-a-terre on the East Side of Manhattan. ''She helped put fashion in the public eye,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times and co-chairman of The Herald Tribune. ''She had a good time with her life,'' added his wife, Carol Sulzberger, a friend of Mrs. Dorsey. Walter N. Thayer, chairman of Whitney Communications and president of The Herald Tribune, commented, ''She was a great lady and a wonderful person who had friends in all walks of life.'' An 'Excellent' Reporter ''I met her 30 years ago when she was a young fashion writer and I was a fashion writer on the 'Today' show,'' Barbara Walters said. ''She never took herself too seriously, though she knew fashion was a serious business.'' Her book, ''La Belle Epoque,'' a compilation of pieces from The Herald Tribune recalling Paris in its heyday, was published there last year. She also wrote a monthly column for French Vogue and contributed articles on fashion and decorating to other publications such as The New York Times. She is survived by three sisters, Zilia Sfez of Tunisia, Yvonne Brami of Nice and Nelly Cohen of Versailles, in addition to her brother. Her son, Joseph, is a photographer in Paris, and her daughter, Monika, lives in New York City. The family requests that instead of flowers contributions be made to the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation, 1150 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10128. Burial will be tomorrow at 10:30 A.M. at the Pantin cemetery outside Paris. A memorial service in New York is being planned by Miss Walters, Marilyn Evins, the fashion publicist, and other friends."

4929,"Phyllis Creore, the Radio 'Canteen Girl,' 100",Sometimes Tokyo Rose was the best thing on the radio -- if you were an American serviceman overseas during World War II. You put up with her demoralizing pro-Japanese propaganda to hear the popular music.,"Sometimes Tokyo Rose was the best thing on the radio -- if you were an American serviceman overseas during World War II. You put up with her demoralizing pro-Japanese propaganda to hear the popular music. But sometimes things were infinitely better. For 15 minutes on Fridays on the shortwave, there was Canteen Girl. Her show, created by NBC's Canteen on the Air in New York and heard from 1942 until the war's end, offered a young woman's all-American voice telling an uplifting story and singing three or four musical numbers in her warm alto, plus her theme, which she had written. It began, ''I wish you luck in everything you do/That all your cares will disappear from view.'' She took song requests (sent by mail) and sometimes read letters on the air from her listeners. ''The gang really enjoys hearing you act those 'skits,' and believe me when I say, 'you make them feel as if their own girl was a talking to them,''' three young men wrote from an Army base in Missouri. They signed themselves Henry, George and Joe, the Supply Room Gang. Seaman Charles Brenner wrote in December 1942: ''I'm in the hospital, and it makes me feel like I am at a canteen. If you know what I mean.'' Lt. C. R. Timms got right to the point: ''I'm free. Am being divorced.'' Phyllis Creore Westermann died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 100 and lived in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, where she kept scrapbooks filled with letters she had received as Canteen Girl. The death was confirmed by Jane Klain of the Paley Center for Media, which has Canteen Girl transmissions in its archives. She was billed as ''Phyllis Jeanne, your Canteen Girl,'' because, she said decades later, somebody must have thought her last name at the time, Creore (cree-ORE), was too hard to pronounce. ''Canteen Girl,'' which was broadcast to stateside soldiers and their families and transmitted by shortwave radio to the troops abroad, had been her idea; with all the confidence that a 26-year-old could muster, she had simply written a script and pitched the idea to some people at NBC whom she knew from her nascent New York acting career. The next thing she knew, she was in a recording studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza with a pianist and a writer, both provided by the network. Ms. Creore's inspiration had been her volunteer work at the Stage Door Canteen, the American Theater Wing's wartime setup in a theater basement on West 44th Street. There, servicemen, many of them about to ship out, could go to listen to lively big-band music, dance with pretty young women and be served hamburgers and hot dogs by visiting movie stars. In 2012, she was interviewed for the podcast ''Downstage Center'' by Pia Lindstrom -- whose mother, Ingrid Bergman, was one of those stars -- and recalled her experience: ''You signed on for once or twice a week, usually in the evening, when you could get away from your job-hunting and auditioning.'' She remembered the evenings as festive, but she said she was also touched deeply by the young men. ''They were only 17, some of them, and they were scared and homesick.'' Even before the war, Ms. Creore had established a small place for herself in entertainment-industry history. At the RCA pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, she essentially introduced America to the invention called television. Hired to embody the persona Miss Television, she explained the new technology to guests and then demonstrated it. ''I stood on the little stage and told them all I could,'' she recalled in an NBC News interview this year. Then she'd choose one visitor from each group and take that person outside to the engineer's truck and talk to him or her. Thanks to a few yards of coaxial cable, the other visitors could watch that conversation on dozens of minuscule TV sets inside. President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited. She adored the work, she told the newspaper AM New York in 2014. ''It was the kind of job where you forget to go for your pay because you have so much fun,'' she said. Phyllis Jeanne Creore was born on March 21, 1916, in Rochester, one of two children of Alvin Creore and the former Florence Geneva Smith. Her father designed dioramas for museums at one point and worked in real estate. Ms. Creore moved to New York City in 1937 and lived at the Rehearsal Club, the West 53rd Street boardinghouse for young actresses made famous by the 1936 Broadway play ''Stage Door'' and its film version the next year. That was where she first heard about the canteens. An announcement on the club's bulletin board read, ''Our boys are coming through New York and need to be danced with and fed, so won't you volunteer?'' The Rehearsal Club was also where she heard on the radio, while her roommates were still asleep, that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. In 1946, Ms. Creore married Ted Westermann, a film and corporate-presentations producer she had met while narrating one of his projects. He died in 1976. Her survivors include a daughter, Cynthia Westermann-Clark; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. She became an artist, exhibiting sculpture and pastels as Phyllis J. Creore. A 2002 review in Gallery & Studio magazine, about an Art Studio Club of New York show at the Broome Street Gallery, praised her ''thorough knowledge of anatomy and sensitive emotional nuance.'' She experienced something of a comeback in 2012 when an exhibition at the New-York Historical Society, ''WWII & NYC,'' included her in short videos about ''Canteen Girl'' and the Stage Door Canteen. She found herself interviewed by a variety of news media, including The Daily News and The New York Times. ''She was thrilled to get back into the limelight,'' said Vivian Ducat, the documentary filmmaker who produced the videos. She described Ms. Creore as gracious and happy, although she had felt ''shut in'' in her final years. ''I think being rediscovered did a lot toward restoring the dignity that was being taken from her by her age, her growing frailty,'' Ms. Ducat said. Ms. Creore's good humor apparently never left her. When, during their podcast chat, Pia Lindstrom declared, ''You're a part of history,'' she replied, with a laugh, ''Well, it took 70 years of waiting.''"
51526,"George Koltanowski, 96, Chess Master Known for Playing While Blindfolded","George Koltanowski, an international chess master and author who excelled at beating opponents without looking at the board, died Feb. 5 in a hospital in San Francisco.","George Koltanowski, an international chess master and author who excelled at beating opponents without looking at the board, died Feb. 5 in a hospital in San Francisco. He was 96. Mr. Koltanowski, known as Kolti, won several chess titles in Europe in the 1920's and 30's but was best known for his skill at blindfold chess, in which a player never looks at the board but makes his moves after being told of his opponent's. He sometimes used a blindfold for stage effect and often played against more than one nonblindfolded opponent at the same time. In 1937, he defeated 34 players simultaneously without looking at any of the boards, setting a world record. In 1960, he set another world record by defeating 56 opponents simultaneously while blindfolded. Mr. Koltanowski attributed his skill at blindfold chess to memory games he played as a boy and to what he called ""the gramophone"" in his head. ""I record everything I hear,"" he told The San Francisco Chronicle, where he was chess columnist for the last 52 years. ""I repeat the moves to myself, and they come back to me, like in football -- an instant replay."" Mr. Koltanowski was born in Antwerp on Sept. 17, 1903. He took up chess at the age of 14 and quickly became the champion of Belgium. He was so good, he gave up his day job as a diamond cutter to become a full-time professional chess player. He was in Guatemala when World War II broke out and he remained in Latin America through much of the war. In 1944, he moved to the United States, with the aid of a chess-loving American diplomat who had seen him play in Cuba. In 1948, he began writing a chess column for The Chronicle, and a column appeared seven days a week until his death; the more than 19,000 columns were often done in advance, a week's worth at a time. He was made an international master by the International Chess Federation in 1950 and an honorary grandmaster in 1988. He was president of the United States Chess Federation from 1976 to 1978 and was inducted into its Hall of Fame in 1986. He was the host of radio and television shows on chess and wrote several books on the game. Mr. Koltanowski is survived by his wife, Leah, who never learned to play chess and often joked that her husband could not remember to bring bread home from the grocery. http://www.nytimes.com"
2167,"Bulat S. Okudzhava, 73, Dies; Poet of Dissent in 50's Russia","Bulat S. Okudzhava, whose spare, telling poems helped forge an important new literature of dissent in Russia during the 1950's and 60's, died on Thursday during a trip to Paris.","MOSCOW, June 13 Bulat S. Okudzhava, whose spare, telling poems helped forge an important new literature of dissent in Russia during the 1950's and 60's, died on Thursday during a trip to Paris. He was 73. Although the cause was not immediately clear and his wife, Olga, told Russian reporters that he died ""from the psychological stress of loneliness,"" the Echo of Moscow Radio station reported today that he had serious complications from pneumonia. One of the most famous of Russia's postwar bards -- men who stood at kitchen tables and told and sang long anecdotes, folklore and poetry filled with subversive subtext -- Mr. Okudzhava became one of the most popular and powerful voices of his generation. His songs, lovingly memorized and repeated by millions, were recorded secretly and smuggled from tape player to tape player in homes across the Soviet Union. His work was never distributed officially during Soviet times nor taught in schools. His immense popularity -- he most often wrote of friendship, truth, labor and the enduring spirit -- testified to the distaste most people had for the official culture that the authorities constantly tried to force on them. Together with many of his contemporaries -- Vladimir Vysotsky, Aleksandr Galich, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Bella Akhmadulina and others -- Mr. Okudzhava helped form what served for the Soviet Union as a beatnik movement. Unlike the much more flamboyant and visibly angry Mr. Vysotsky, Mr. Okudzhava rarely raised his voice, even when singing and strumming his acoustical guitar, or entered explicitly political debates. His messages of loss and unfulfilled longing were personal and often so well concealed in his work that the Soviet authorities, while expelling him from the Communist Party in 1972 and often prohibiting him from performing, never actually jailed him. ""Let us hold each other's hands so we will not die one by one,"" perhaps his most famous lyric, was a line that seemed inoffensive enough until one thought about it for a while. The official press often attacked Mr. Okudzhava for expressing such sentiments, accusing him of dangerous pacifism and being a dilettante. Nor did the authorities always ignore his digs. His third volume of poetry was originally titled ""The Midnight Trolley Bus,"" a reference to the last bus home and the last hope for all the ""shipwrecked,"" the drunks and the defeated who wandered the lonely streets of Moscow each night. The censors were appalled, forcing him to name the volume ""The Happy Drummer."" He often sang of the Arbat, one of Moscow's most famous and picturesque streets, which was destroyed by Nikita S. Khrushchev during a campaign to bring modern buildings to the city. His vaguely dissident image was reinforced by later novels, grotesque tales of 19th-century Russian revolutionaries and writers hunted down by the czarist secret service. Bulat Okudzhava was born on May 9, 1924, in Moscow, and his youth was consumed by the terror of the times. His father, who was Georgian and a Communist Party functionary, was shot in 1937, the worst year of Stalin's repression. His mother was arrested that year and spent a decade in labor camps. After studying linguistics at Tbilisi University in Georgia, Mr. Okudzhava enlisted in the army in 1942 and was wounded. After the war he taught at an agricultural school, was a journalist and worked for a publisher before focusing full time on his writing and music. Soviet critics attacked his autobiographical antiwar novel of 1961, ""Be Well, Schoolboy,"" complaining of the ""infantile psychology of the hero."" Recordings of his songs were sold widely in West Germany and even in Poland in the late 1960's, but it was not until 1970 that he was permitted his first broadcast on Moscow Radio. In 1994, Mr. Okudzhava won the Russian Booker Prize. While not expressly political, he was one of the many intellectuals in Russia who broke with President Boris N. Yeltsin over the war in Chechnya, then reluctantly supported his re-election in 1996, when he ran against a Communist, Gennadi A. Zyuganov. He had many heart problems over the last decade, and several years ago he had bypass surgery in the United States. Last year he had a heart attack. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin announced today that Mr. Okudzhava would be buried in Moscow's prestigious Vagankovskoye Cemetery on Tuesday."

He was 79. The cause was complications of diabetes, his family said. Mr. Goto, who was born in Hilo, Hawaii, in 1916, learned the craft of welding while working for the Army during World War II. He attended the Art Institute of Chicago in the late 1940's and had his first show at the Frumkin Gallery in Chicago in 1956. His first exhibition in New York was at the Stephen Radich Gallery in the early 1960's; his last was at the Zabriskie Gallery in 1973. His works, which ranged from table-top pieces to monumental outdoor sculptures, continued a tradition of improvisational welded composition started by David Smith. Over the years he held teaching positions at the University of Michigan, Brandeis University, Carnegie-Mellon University and the Rhode Island School of Design, which mounted a retrospective of his work in 1971. His work is represented in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art and the Rhode Island School of Design. He is survived by his wife, June; a daughter, Joji; a son, Kai, and four grandchildren, all of Pawtucket; and a brother, Byron, of New York City."
7661,"SEMYON K. TSVIGUN, OF THE K.G.B., DIES","Gen. Semyon Kuzmich Tsvigun, the deputy head of the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence and internal security agency, died Tuesday at the age of 64, it was announced today.","MOSCOW, Jan. 20 Gen. Semyon Kuzmich Tsvigun, the deputy head of the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence and internal security agency, died Tuesday at the age of 64, it was announced today. General Tsvigun was believed to be married to a sister of Leonid I. Brezhnev's wife, Viktoriya, but this has never been officially confirmed. In contrast to the secrecy surrounding most K.G.B. personnel, General Tsvigun was something of a public figure. He served in the provinces for 16 years before assuming his post at headquarters in Moscow in 196 7. He was the highest ranking career officer in the K.G.B. under Yuri V. Andropov, a party official who has headed the agency for mo st of the Brezhnev period. General Tsvigun appeared from time to time in ideological publications. In an article last September in the party journal Kommunist, he said the dissident movement had been routed. High Civilian Award in 1977 The press took note in 1977 when he received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, the highest civilian award; in 1978, when he was promoted to full general, and last year, when he advanced from alternate to full member in the party's Central Committee. Born Sept. 27, 1917, into a Ukrainian peasa nt family, he was graduated in 1937 from the Odessa Teachers Co llege and taught school for two years before joining the secret polic e. His 42-year career with the state security agency was interrupte d only by service in theRed Army in World War II. In 1951, he was posted to the Moldavian Republic on the Rumanian border at a time when Mr. Brezhnev was the party chief there. Four years later, General Tsvigun was sent to the Central Asian republic of Tadzhikistan, and for four years, he served as K.G.B. chief in the Transcaucasian republic of Azerbaijan. In late 1967, he was brought back to Moscow and made the agency's First Deputy Chairman. An official obituary today said his memory would be cherished by all Chekists, as K.G.B. personnel are known, for the Cheka, the initial name of the Soviet secret police. Some Publicity for the K.G.B. The prominence given his death was in keeping with a trend toward giving the K.G.B. measured publicity, both in its foreign intelligence activities and in safeguarding internal security. General Tsvigun's article in Kommunist last fall offered a candid list of trends and movements considered subversive. He said the dissident movement, which he described as an attempt by the West to subvert the Communist system, had been crushed, but he warned of new forms of subversion. They were said to be associated with Western reports on Soviet consumer shortages, the emigration movement among Jews, ethnic Germans and Armenians, various emigre groups abroad, and the affinity of Soviet young people for the Western way of life."

He survived imprisonment in a Nazi labor camp during World War II and in the late 1940's studied sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest. He immigrated to the United States in 1957, settling in New York, where he began making abstract sculptures out of globes and spheres of highly finished polyester. Mr. Biro helped found 55 Mercer in 1970 and showed there for eight years.

40755,"Tristan E. Beplat, 85, Banker Who Aided Japan After War","Tristan E. Beplat, an international banking executive who played an important role in the economic reconstruction of postwar Japan, died on Friday at the Columbia Medical Center in Ormond Beach, Fla.","Tristan E. Beplat, an international banking executive who played an important role in the economic reconstruction of postwar Japan, died on Friday at the Columbia Medical Center in Ormond Beach, Fla. He was 85 and lived in Princeton, N.J., and Daytona Beach, Fla. He died of complications after a fall, his nephew, Raymond E. Beplat, said. A Manhattan native, Mr. Beplat began his banking career in 1937, joining what was then the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. It was during World War II that his involvement with Japan and Asia began. As a first lieutenant in 1944, he was selected to participate on a team to help rebuild the economy of postwar Japan. The team was led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Because of his experience with foreign currency trading, Mr. Benplat was named chief of the foreign exchange operation in the early phase of the United States occupation of Japan after its surrender in 1945. Mustered out of the Army a year later, Mr. Beplat remained in Japan as a civilian but continued to serve the military in Tokyo as the chief of its money and banking branch and as chairman of the foreign exchange committee. It was in this capacity that Mr. Baplat helped to forge a policy that set the value of the yen at 360 to the dollar, a sharp devaluation from its prewar value of 2.50 to the dollar. ""We wanted the Japanese to be able to export,"" Mr. Beplat said in a 1986 interview with Forbes magazine. ""We wanted them on our side politically, and figured that 90 percent of Japanese exports could sell at a 300 exchange rate, even though some were profitable at 200. But we didn't want to be wrong on such an important matter."" The program worked so well that Japanese exports rose from $1 billion in 1950 to $24 billion by 1971, when President Richard M. Nixon ended the postwar system of fixed exchange rates. After being appointed a consultant to the State Department in October 1948, Mr. Beplat opened a representative office in Japan for Manufacturers Hanover, the first such postwar office for an American bank. He remained in that capacity in Tokyo until he returned to the United States in 1954. The next year, he took charge of the bank's banking relations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand. In 1963 he was named senior vice president. At retirement in 1974, he was senior vice president and deputy general manager of the international division. Manufacturers Hanover later merged with Chemical Banking, which subsequently merged with Chase Manhattan. Shortly after he left the bank, Mr. Beplat was decorated by the Japanese Government, receiving the Second Order of the Sacred Treasure for his services during the occupation. From his home in Princeton, N.J., Mr. Beplat used his Asian acquaintances and expertise to consult on international finance and investment after he left Manufacturers Hanover. One of those acquaintances was Ferdinand E. Marcos, the leader of the Philippine Government. In the mid-1980's, Mr. Beplat's name came up during an investigation by New Jersey officials seeking to untangle the financial web spun in that state by Mr. Marcos. Mr. Beplat told investigators that Mr. Marcos had asked him to acquire homes in New Jersey for use by the Marcos children while they attended Princeton University. In a deposition, Mr. Beplat said he had been wired almost $500,000 from the Philippine Mission in the final days of the Marcos regime. Mr. Beplat, who received the Philippine Government's highest civilian award from President Marcos in 1971 for his efforts at financing Philippine infrastructure projects, later served as a consultant to the Philippine Government of President Corazon Aquino. Mr. Beplat was active in a number of societies promoting business and understanding between Asia and the United States, including the Japan Society, the Ceylon Association and the American-Indonesian Chamber of Commerce. He is survived by three brothers, James of Cummington, Mass., Raymond of East Northport, N.Y., and Howard of South Jamesport, N.Y., and two sisters, Grace B. King of Slingerlands, N.Y., and Muriel B. Collier of Weems, Va. His wife of 49 years, the former Margaret Mosher, died in 1990."
34003,"Frank Durkan, Irish Advocate, Dies at 76","Frank Durkan, who as a lawyer, writer and political spokesman carved out a reputation as a fierce and clever defender of Irish nationalists, died on Thursday in Greenwich, Conn.","Frank Durkan, who as a lawyer, writer and political spokesman carved out a reputation as a fierce and clever defender of Irish nationalists, died on Thursday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 76. The cause was complications of a lung infection, his cousin Brian O'Dwyer said. Mr. Durkan was a scion of the O'Dwyer political dynasty, started by William O'Dwyer, who immigrated from County Mayo in Ireland in 1910 and became mayor of New York. Mr. Durkan hopscotched among the nation's courtrooms, fighting tenaciously for the interests and rights of Irish-Americans who came into conflict with the law because of their involvement in the tangled politics of Northern Ireland. One of his famous clients was George Harrison, the Irish Republican Army's main gunrunner in the United States for many years. During Mr. Harrison's trial in 1982, the prosecutor accused him of having run guns for the previous six months. Mr. Durkan rose to tell the judge that his client was deeply insulted, and said, ''Mr. Harrison has been running guns for the last 25 years at least.'' The lawyer was able to convince the jury that the Central Intelligence Agency was behind the scheme. Mr. Harrison and his four co-defendants, who had been caught with about 50 machine guns and other weapons, were found not guilty. Mr. Durkan accomplished this legal legerdemain by eliciting the testimony of Ramsey Clark, the former attorney general, who said that the C.I.A. routinely denied involvement in activities they wanted to cover up. Mr. Durkan then persuaded the jury that the agency's denial in fact represented affirmation. In the 1981 case of Desmond Mackin, whom Britain wanted extradited to stand trial on charges of shooting one of its soldiers, Mr. Durkan succeeded by convincing a federal magistrate that the shooting was a political act. Mr. Mackin was not extradited because the extradition treaty between the United States and Britain had a political-exemption provision. Still another major case involved five Irish-Americans accused of a gunrunning operation between Mexico and Ireland in 1970. They were held in contempt of court for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury in Fort Worth, and were eventually freed when Justice William O. Douglas of the United States Supreme Court granted them bail in 1972. Mr. O'Dwyer said the challenge Mr. Durkan faced in that case was persuading his clients not to testify against one another. Mr. Durkan was chairman of Americans for a New Irish Agenda, which was established in 1992 as Irish-Americans for Clinton-Gore. The name was changed to attract Irish-Americans regardless of their political affiliation. Mr. Durkan wrote extensively on political issues in local Irish-American newspapers and was a supporter of the Irish Northern Aid committee. Some said the group funneled arms to the I.R.A., but he insisted the aid was humanitarian. Francis Patrick Durkan was born in Bohola in County Mayo, Ireland, in 1930, the second son of two teachers. He immigrated to New York in 1947 and went straight to Gracie Mansion, the residence of his uncle William O'Dwyer, the mayor of New York. He was put up overnight in grand style, but the next day another uncle, Paul O'Dwyer, a liberal activist and Democratic politician who later served as president of the City Council, took him to a building on 97th Street and arranged for him to work as a janitor. Mr. Durkan, who called this ''a harsh dose of reality in 24 hours,'' held jobs as a liquor store clerk and a racetrack parking attendant, among others. He graduated from Columbia in 1951 and from New York Law School in 1953, then served as a clerk for two years at O'Dwyer and Bernstein, the law firm where Paul O'Dwyer was the senior partner. In addition to his work on Irish matters, he specialized in negligence and malpractice cases. He also did some legal work for the Newspaper Guild of New York. Mr. Durkan, who lived in Rye, N.Y., is survived by his wife, the former Monica Goggin; two daughters, Ashling, of Memphis, and Mary Louise Martin, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and two grandsons. His involvement with things Irish extended to the presidency of the Mayo Football Club of New York, a Gaelic football team, as well as the presidency of the Irish Institute, which supports Irish organizations. When openly gay men and women were excluded from Manhattan's St. Patrick's Day parade, he refused to take part. In 2004, Newsday reported that he marched instead in a parade of gay men and women in Queens. ''The Constitution says everybody is equal,'' he said in an interview. ''I don't have to know much more.''"

Crawford Jr., who headed the Bowery Savings Bank from 1965 until 1980, died of congestive heart failure, according to his wife, Dorothy, on Wednesday at his home in Riverside, Conn. He was 83. During his 40 years as a lawyer and banker in New York, Mr. Crawford served as a member or officer of dozens of professional, political and civic boards, including the Harlem School for the Performing Arts, the Salvation Army and the U.S.O. of New York City. In 1979, the Regional Plan Association, a research and planning agency for promoting the coordinated development of the metropolitan region of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, honored Mr. Crawford, a former chairman of the association, for his efforts to rebuild central cities through corporate, civic and government partnerships. Under his chairmanship, the association's leaders noted, the Bowery Savings Bank -- then the nation's biggest mutual savings bank -- initiated programs for brownstone renewal, sweat equity and the financing of housing in economically depressed neighborhoods. They also credited him with playing a leading role in helping establish the Aaron Davis Center for the Performing Arts at City University and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University. Born in Nyack, N.Y., in 1915, the son of a newspaperman with Fairchild Publications in New York, Rusty (as he was called because of his red hair) graduated from Harvard College in 1937 with a degree in anthropology. Shortly before his graduation, he was accepted at Harvard Law School and offered a post at Harvard College as an instructor in anthropology. Undecided which offer to take, ""About two weeks before graduation I flipped a mental coin,"" he recalled almost 30 years later. ""I went to law school."" He graduated from law school in 1940 and joined the New York law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. He enlisted in the United States Army in February 1942 and served on General Douglas MacArthur's staff in Manila before being discharged as a major in April 1946. He returned to his old law firm, but left in 1953 when he was named vice president and office counsel of the Bowery. During the next dozen years he rose steadily through the ranks to executive vice president, president and then chief executive, heading the bank for the next 15 years until his retirement in 1980.

He was 77. The cause was congestive heart failure, said his wife, Patricia. He lived in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Mr. Hudson worked in photojournalism for more than three decades, beginning as an Army photographer in the Korean War. Covering the civil rights movement in the 1960s, he photographed protests in Birmingham and Selma, Ala., where the police turned dogs and fire hoses on demonstrators. His most enduring photograph of the era, taken on May 3, 1963, shows an officer in dark sunglasses in Birmingham grabbing a young black man by his sweater and letting a police dog lunge at the man's stomach. The man, Walter Gadsden, with his eyes lowered, has a passive look. The photograph appeared across three columns at the top of the next day's front page of The New York Times. In ''Carry Me Home,'' a 2001 book about the civil rights era in Birmingham, Diane McWhorter wrote that the photograph helped move ''international opinion to the side of the civil rights revolution.'' Mr. Hudson's wife said he encountered a great deal of animosity from those who did not want him documenting the treatment of the protesters. ''Sometimes people were throwing rocks and bricks at him,'' she said. Mr. Hudson was born Aug. 20, 1932, in Detroit and began his career in the Army in 1949.

26627,"Mary Soames, Daughter of Churchill and Chronicler of History, Dies at 91","Mary Soames, the last surviving child of Winston Churchill, lived a storybook life and chronicled it in her own well-received books.","Mary Soames, the last surviving child of Winston Churchill, lived a storybook life and chronicled it in her own well-received books. After her family announced her death at 91 on May 31 in London, Prime Minister David Cameron called her ''an eyewitness to some of the most important moments in our recent history.'' There was the idyllic childhood at Chartwell, the family estate, where she tamed fox cubs, raised orphan lambs and played in a brick house built for her by her father, whose hobbies included bricklaying. Guests included Charlie Chaplin, who amused her by impersonating Napoleon, and T. E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, who dressed up in his princely Arab robes. On the eve of World War II, Nol Coward sang ''Mad Dogs and Englishmen'' to her family and their guests. During the war, after overhearing a general advising her father, the prime minister, that England should seek women for undermanned antiaircraft batteries, she enlisted as a private without his knowledge. On the banks of the English Channel, she shot down flying bombs hurtling toward England. She accompanied Churchill to summit meetings as his personal aide, including the Potsdam conference in 1945, where her father, President Harry S. Truman and the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin planned the postwar world. She found Stalin ''small, dapper and rather twinkly.'' After several ill-fated romances, she married Christopher Soames, a dashing member of the Coldstream Guards, one of the most ancient regiments in the British Army, and nurtured his career as a prominent Tory politician, ambassador to France and the last governor of one of Britain's last major colonies, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). They had five children -- Nicholas, Emma, Jeremy, Charlotte and Rupert -- who, with a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, survive her. She acquired the title Lady when Mr. Soames was knighted in 1972. Queen Elizabeth II named him a baron in 1978. After Baron Soames died in 1987, she was chairwoman of the Royal National Theater for six years. But her most lauded personal achievement was a series of books she wrote about her family. The first, ''Clementine Churchill: The Biography of a Marriage'' (1979), was a biography of her mother. It won the Wolfson History Prize, given annually to a British subject for excellence in the writing of history. The book referred to her mother as ''an old-fashioned radical'' with ''latent hostility toward the Tory Party,'' which her husband led. It revealed their affectionate nicknames: She was ''Kat,'' he ''Pug'' and their children ''kittens.'' Once, Lady Soames wrote, an argument climaxed in Churchill's throwing a plate of spinach at his wife, but they always made up quickly after their spats. Her other books included an annotated family photo album, an examination of Churchill as a painter and a 702-page collection of letters between Churchill and his wife. They wrote each other every day, even when they were in the same house. ''The duration of the Churchills' intimacy, their private day inside so much history, is even now -- no, especially now -- a source of amazement,'' Thomas Mallon, a novelist and critic, said in reviewing the book for The New York Times Book Review. In 2011, Lady Soames wrote of her life up to her engagement at 25 -- and of her father's penchant for funny clothes, including a 10-gallon hat -- in ''A Daughter's Tale: The Memoir of Winston Churchill's Youngest Child.'' A review in The New Criterion called the book ''clear, sharp, occasionally opinionated and understatedly witty.'' Lady Soames came to be regarded as something of a national treasure and was named a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and a Dame of the British Empire. In 2005, Queen Elizabeth appointed her a Ladies Companion of the Garter, Britain's highest chivalric order. After the death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 2013, Lady Soames was one of only two living nonroyal women so honored. The other is Eliza Manningham-Buller, who commanded Britain's counterterrorism efforts as head of MI5, the internal security agency, from 2002 to 2007. Mary Spencer-Churchill was born in London on Sept. 15, 1922. A year earlier, her sister Marigold died of tonsillitis at 2 . Her arrival, she wrote, helped compensate her parents for their bitter loss; she was, she said, ''a child of consolation.'' Her living siblings were so much older -- Diana by 13 years, Randolph by 11 and Sarah by 8 -- that she regarded them as ''godlike Olympian figures.'' As a girl, she lived almost entirely with grown-ups. Her father wrote that at 5, she spoke ''in the tone and style of a woman of 30.'' He doted on her, but she said she did not become close to her mother until the two went skiing in Switzerland when she was around 13. During her early youth, Mary's closest companion was her nanny, Maryott Whyte, a first cousin of her mother and a trained nurse. Lady Soames once attributed the divorces, substance abuse and relatively early deaths of her siblings to their lack of a rock of stability like Ms. Whyte. ''I don't know why I turned out like this while the others had such problems,'' she said in a 2002 interview, ''and comparisons are always odious, aren't they? But I do think Nana made a great difference.'' During the war, Lady Soames was briefly engaged to the son of an earl and also had a romance with an American Army officer. In 1946, she and her father made a private trip to Belgium with the apparent goal of her becoming engaged to Prince Charles, who was ruling the country as regent. On Sept. 27, The Associated Press reported that an engagement announcement was likely the next day. That never happened. Churchill decided to go to Paris to meet with the American secretary of state, James F. Byrnes. Lady Soames accompanied him and met Captain Soames, assistant military attach for the British Embassy. She later said that he fell in love immediately, but that it took her a few weeks. In an interview at the time, she was asked if she intended to be a ''career wife'' or a ''housewife.'' ''A housewife, of course,'' she said. Being Baron Soames's wife involved staging famously entertaining parties in Paris. It also meant speaking off the cuff to 900 guerrillas in Rhodesia. Her husband's political opponents often complained that they were actually running not against Mr. Soames but against the daughter of a national hero. Lady Soames, who was short and stocky like her father and perhaps as stubborn, savored a fine cigar. After she quit smoking, around 2000, she auctioned off the family stash of Havanas for $221,000."
25280,"Carroll Shelby, Car Builder Who Added Muscle to American Racing, Dies at 89","Carroll Shelby, a Texas chicken farmer turned hot-rodder who went on to build innovative sports cars like the Cobra that challenged Europe's longtime dominance of road racing as well as high-performance versions of production cars like the Ford Mustang, died on Thursday in Dallas.","Carroll Shelby, a Texas chicken farmer turned hot-rodder who went on to build innovative sports cars like the Cobra that challenged Europe's longtime dominance of road racing as well as high-performance versions of production cars like the Ford Mustang, died on Thursday in Dallas. He was 89. His death was announced by his company, Carroll Shelby International. In the 1960s, Shelby raised the profile of American racing machines on the international sports-car circuit by packing powerful Ford V-8 engines into lightweight British roadsters, and by developing racing cars for Ford. His Shelby Cobras proved worthy competitors to the likes of Ferrari, Maserati and Jaguar and became prized collector's items. Today they command six- and seven-figure prices. ''Carroll is sort of like the car world's Mickey Mantle or Willie Mays,'' Jay Leno, who owned three Shelby cars, told The New York Times in 2003. ''Unlike so many racers, he didn't come from a rich family, so he signifies that Everyman, common-sense ideal. When I was a kid, American cars were big, clunky things, until Carroll used his ingenuity to make them compete with European cars.'' In 1959, Shelby became the second American-born driver to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the brutal endurance race in France, co-driving a British-made Aston Martin. But a heart ailment forced him to quit driving, and he founded Shelby American in 1962. It became one of the most successful independent sports-car builders of the era. Shelby began building his Cobras in 1962 using the chassis and body of a two-seater from AC Cars of England. Early prototypes broke apart because of stress on the fragile frames. ''When you try to put 300 horsepower in a car designed for 100, you learn what development means,'' Shelby recalled in a 2002 interview with Sports Illustrated. But the Cobra with the high-powered Ford engine proved a formidable racer, celebrated in pop culture when the Rip Chords recorded ''Hey Little Cobra'' in 1964. The Cobra captured the United States Road Racing Championship series of the Sports Car Club of America in 1963 and won the Grand Touring world championship in the large-engine category in 1965. Soon after Lee A. Iacocca of Ford introduced the Mustang in 1964, he asked Shelby to help create a high-performance version for racing. In January 1965, the first Shelby Mustang, the GT350, made its debut. Shelby also developed the Ford GT40, and the Shelby GT500 and GT500KR (the KR stood for King of the Road). Carroll Hall Shelby was born on Jan. 11, 1923, in Leesburg, Tex., where his father, Warren, a rural mail carrier, became a car buff, making his rounds in a 1928 Whippet. Shelby served as a flight instructor in the Army Air Forces during World War II, then worked in Texas oil fields and became a chicken farmer. One Sunday in 1952, as he told it, a wartime buddy drove up ''in a little ol' English car called an MG'' and invited him to take a ride. He soon envisioned a world beyond his farm chores. He entered his first race in 1952, driving in a quarter-mile drag meet, then won road races in the Southwest. But he was still working on his farm and practicing in striped bib coveralls because he did not have time for a change of clothes. They became his trademark outfit. His fortunes took a turn in 1954 when he came to the attention of the Aston Martin team. He drove for the team that year at Sebring, Fla., and in Europe. In November 1957, driving a Maserati single-seater, he won a 100-mile race at Riverside, Calif., after spinning out on the first lap and then going to the back of the field. He was one of America's leading sports-car drivers by then. The Shelby-American team's Ford GT40 won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966 and 1967. Those victories ended a winning streak by Ferrari that began in 1960, the year after Shelby teamed with Roy Salvadori of Britain to win in their Aston Martin. Phil Hill, co-driving a Ferrari, was the only American-born racer to have won at Le Mans before Shelby, capturing the race in 1958. (Luigi Chinetti, who won in 1949, was an American citizen but was born in Italy.) ''Carroll desperately wanted to beat all the Europeans at Le Mans,'' C. Van Tune, a onetime Shelby employee who was later editor in chief of Motor Trend magazine, told The Dallas Morning News in 2001. ''He wanted to show all those fancy, highbred Euros in their slick racing suits that a chicken farmer from Texas could beat them at their own game.'' Shelby was a distinctive figure on the European racing scene of the late 1950s. ''My wife was at Le Mans when he won,'' David E. Davis, the founder of Automobile magazine, once told Vanity Fair. ''And she said he was just the epitome of America -- the overalls, the colorful language, the big mop of curly hair.'' For all of Shelby's achievements, tougher federal pollution standards and soaring insurance premiums took their toll on muscle cars. Production of the original run of Shelby Mustangs ended in 1970. Shelby turned to pursuits beyond the sports-car world. He began marketing a chili mix in 1969 and spent time in Africa during the 1970s, hunting big game and organizing expeditions. After founding a wheel company and an automobile club, he returned to sports-car design in 1982. When Iacocca became chairman of Chrysler, he signed Shelby again, and their pairing resulted in special-edition performance models of the Dodge Charger, among other cars. Shelby had a heart transplant in 1990. A year later, he founded the Carroll Shelby Children's Foundation, now known as the Carroll Shelby Foundation, which financed organ transplants for children, then expanded to provide educational assistance for young people. In 2003, Shelby teamed with Ford in a partnership that included design of new Mustang models for the company's centennial. He came to the New York Auto Show in 2007 to introduce a new Ford GT500KR, a 540-horsepower version of the original King of the Road model. Shelby's success with the Cobra inspired various companies to market replicas -- kit cars to be assembled by the buyer -- leading him to bring lawsuits charging trademark infringement. In 2000, Shelby filed a federal suit against Factory Five Racing, a Massachusetts company. It resulted in a settlement that allowed the company to continue producing components for cars in the shape of a Cobra but precluded it from using the Cobra name or similar trademarks associated with Shelby. Shelby is survived by his wife, Cleo; his children, Patrick, Michael and Sharon; and a sister, Anne Shelby Ellison. Shelby had homes in the Bel Air hills of Los Angeles and in Las Vegas, and owned ranchland in Pittsburg, Tex., where he raised miniature horses and African cattle while keeping his hand in high-performance design into his later years. He owned small vintage planes and numerous cars, including his original Cobra. He possessed the brashness and imagination of a consummate promoter. Bill Neale, an automotive artist who illustrated Shelby's designs, once recalled for Vanity Fair that when Shelby assembled his first Cobra, he painted it yellow and had it photographed for the cover of a magazine. The next day, he showed another magazine what seemed to be an identical car, colored red. ''I said, 'You have two of them?' '' Neale recalled. ''And he said, 'Nah, we just painted it so they think we have two.' ''"

Kissinger surreptitiously slip into China for 36 hours to lay the groundwork for President Richard M. Nixon's historic visit to China, died Sunday at his home in Winchester, Va.","Joseph S. Farland, who as the American ambassador to Pakistan in 1971 helped Henry A. Kissinger surreptitiously slip into China for 36 hours to lay the groundwork for President Richard M. Nixon's historic visit to China, died Sunday at his home in Winchester, Va. He was 92. The cause was complications of a stroke, his son Richard said. With a reputation for working outside diplomatic protocols, Mr. Farland -- a former F.B.I. agent and, in the Eisenhower years, an adviser on military intelligence -- was ambassador to the Dominican Republic from 1957 to 1960; to Panama from 1960 to 1963; to Pakistan from 1969 to 1972; and to Iran from 1972 to 1973. It was in the spring of 1971 that Mr. Farland, as ambassador to Pakistan, helped create the ruse under which Mr. Kissinger, then Nixon's national security adviser, would arrive in Islamabad on July 8, apparently for talks with President Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan, the military dictator at the time. According to the plan, Mr. Kissinger feigned a severe stomachache and was taken to President Khan's mountain rest house. From there, Mr. Kissinger was flown to southern China for a clandestine meeting, from July 9 to 11, with the Chinese premier, Chou En-lai. There, they arranged for Nixon's weeklong trip to China in February 1972, which restructured long-strained diplomatic relations. In his 1979 book, ''White House Years,'' Mr. Kissinger wrote: ''We were fortunate that our ambassador in Pakistan at that moment was a man outside the regular Foreign Service establishment. A traditionalist would never have responded without reinsuring himself by a 'personal' communication to his departmental chiefs in Washington. Farland, moreover, was as matter-of-factly able as he was conscientious. He handled the complicated arrangement for my trip with unfailing skill and discretion.'' Joseph Simpson Farland was born on Aug. 11, 1914, in Clarksburg, W.Va., the only child of Richard and Grace Simpson Farland. His father was a banker. He graduated from West Virginia University in 1936 and a earned a law degree there in 1938. A year later he married Virginia Christopher, a daughter of a local coal mine owner; Mrs. Farland died in 1978. Besides his son Richard, of Berryville, Va., Mr. Farland is survived by another son, Christopher, of Wilmington, N.C.; two daughters, Brooke Oatley of St. Simon's Island, Ga., and Page Craw of Natchez, Miss.; 11 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Mr. Farland joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1942. Two years later, he was commissioned as a Navy officer and assigned to do research on strategic issues regarding Asia. Returning to West Virginia in 1946, he became president of his father-in-law's coal company and started two of his own. But in 1956, Mr. Farland, who had been active in West Virginia Republican politics, was asked by President Eisenhower to be deputy director of the United States Mutual Security Agency, a successor to the Marshall Plan that combined foreign aid and military assistance programs. A year later, he was named ambassador to the Dominican Republic. By 1960, Eisenhower was contemplating American support for opponents of both Rafael Trujillo, the dictator of the Dominican Republic, and, as a counterweight, President Fidel Castro of Cuba. Records of the Church Committee -- a 1975 Senate investigation headed by Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, into ''Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders'' -- say, ''Ambassador Farland established contact with a group of dissidents regarded as moderate, pro-United States and desirous of establishing a democratic form of government.'' The records also say that a leading dissident ''made a specific request to Ambassador Farland for a limited number of rifles with telescopic sites,'' and that he ''apparently'' passed along the request to the State Department and the C.I.A. On May 30, 1961, Trujillo was assassinated. But the rifles had never been delivered, the committee report says, and no direct link between the White House and the assassins was ever established. After his Dominican posting, Mr. Farland was named ambassador to Panama. There, he pushed for direct American aid for the construction of rural roads and housing for the poor. He resigned in September 1963, protesting what he called excessive management by the State Department's Bureau of Inter-American Affairs, which opposed his plans for direct aid. An article in The New York Times said Mr. Farland ''concluded that the department preferred a more classical diplomatic approach, even though his tactics, which involved visits to virtually every town and village in Panama in the last three years, brought vast popularity to the United States.'' His resignation prompted three weeks of acclaim by Panamanian farmers, teachers, union officials and even industrialists, culminating in an uproarious farewell ceremony attended by thousands. From Iran, in August 1972, he sent a cable to Washington warning that unless Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi answered ''some of the political, economic and social complaints'' of ordinary Iranians, he would face a rebellion. Six years later, his prediction came true."

52138,"Slim Dusty, 76, the Balladeer Of Australian Outback Life","Slim Dusty, the Australian country singer whose 105 albums of cowboy songs captured the culture of the outback, died at his home here on Friday.","SYDNEY, Australia, Sept. 19 Slim Dusty, the Australian country singer whose 105 albums of cowboy songs captured the culture of the outback, died at his home here on Friday. He was 76. He suffered from kidney cancer, said Chris O'Hearne, marketing manager for his record company, EMI Australia. David Gordon Kirkpatrick was born in 1927 in the coastal town of Kempsey and grew up on a dairy farm in nearby Nulla Nulla Creek. At 10 he wrote his first song, ""The Way the Cowboy Dies,"" and a year later renamed himself Slim Dusty. He always performed playing the guitar and wearing his trademark cowboy hat. Slim Dusty signed his first recording contract in 1946. But it wasn't until 1958 that his career really took off, with the hit ""A Pub With No Beer,"" about a stockman -- Australian for cowboy -- who travels hundreds of miles to an outback bar only to find it has run dry. Slim Dusty went on to be one of the most prolific and biggest-selling recording artists in Australia. He performed dozens of concerts across the nation each year, often playing with his family. ""He was so intrinsically and unapologetically Australian,"" said the music historian Glenn A. Baker. In 2000, Slim Dusty performed for his largest audience, playing Australia's unofficial anthem, the ballad ""Waltzing Matilda,"" which tells the story of a homeless man who steals a sheep, at the closing ceremony of the Sydney Olympics. ""I remember an enormous smile on my face thinking, 'There are four billion people around the world sitting there wondering what this old bloke in the hat with the flat voice was singing about a sheep thief,' "" Mr. Baker recalled. He was recording his 106th album when he died. Slim Dusty is survived by his wife, Joy McKean; a daughter, Anne Kirkpatrick; and a son, David Kirkpatrick."
