7744,"Donald Shirley, a Pianist With Own Genre, Dies at 86","Donald Shirley, a pianist and composer who gathered classical music with jazz and other forms of popular music under a singular umbrella after being discouraged from pursuing a classical career because he was black, died on April 6 at his home in Manhattan.","Donald Shirley, a pianist and composer who gathered classical music with jazz and other forms of popular music under a singular umbrella after being discouraged from pursuing a classical career because he was black, died on April 6 at his home in Manhattan. He was 86. His death, which was not widely reported at the time, was caused by complications of heart disease, said Michiel Kappeyne van de Coppello, a friend who studied piano with Mr. Shirley. A son of Jamaican parents, Mr. Shirley was a musical prodigy who played much of the standard concert repertory by age 10 and made his professional debut with the Boston Pops at 18, performing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor. But when he was in his 20s, he told his family and friends, the impresario Sol Hurok advised him to pursue a career in popular music and jazz, warning him that American audiences were not willing to accept a ''colored'' pianist on the concert stage. Thus derailed, Mr. Shirley took to playing at nightclubs and invented what amounted to his own musical genre. First as part of a duo with a bassist and later as the leader of the Don Shirley Trio, featuring a bassist and a cellist -- an unusual instrumentation suggesting the sonorities of an organ -- he produced music that synthesized popular and classical sounds. He often melded American and European traditions by embedding a well-known melody within a traditional classical structure. In his hands, Irving Berlin's ''Blue Skies,'' for example, became an elaborate set of variations on a theme. In his arrangement -- he called his works transcriptions -- of George Shearing's ''Lullaby of Birdland,'' the famous melody abruptly became a fugue. His recording of Richard Rodgers's ''This Nearly Was Mine,'' from ''South Pacific,'' was Chopinesque. Mr. Shirley's music exhibited a vast musical erudition. He was drawn to indigenous American forms, by which he meant the blues, the work song, the Negro spiritual and the show tune, and his compositions referred to those forms. He was not inclined to improvise and disliked being referred to as a jazz musician. ''He had a love-hate relationship with jazz,'' Mr. Kappeyne van de Coppello said. Still, he was close to many well-known jazz figures, including Duke Ellington, in whose honor he wrote ''Divertimento for Duke by Don,'' a symphonic work that had its premiere in 1974, performed by the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra of Ontario. His other orchestral works include a tone poem inspired by James Joyce's ''Finnegans Wake.'' His playing was virtuosic and lush, and in performance he often impressed critics with both his sound and invention. (His admirers also included Igor Stravinsky and Sarah Vaughan.) He eventually did make it back to the concert stage, though rarely to perform the standard classical repertory. He played Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' at La Scala in Milan; he played at Carnegie Hall with Ellington; he played Gershwin's Concerto in F, accompanying the Alvin Ailey dancers, at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In the late 1960s, he made unreleased recordings of Rachmaninoff with the New York Philharmonic and Khachaturian with the Minneapolis Symphony. ''The silky tone and supple rhythmic flow of Mr. Shirley's playing is just as artful and ingratiating as ever,'' Peter G. Davis wrote in The New York Times of a concert at Carnegie Hall in 1971. '' 'I Can't Get Started' heard as a Chopin nocturne, or 'Blowin' in the Wind' as a Rachmaninoff tude, may strike some as a trifle odd, but these -- and everything on the program, in fact -- were beautifully tailored to spotlight Mr. Shirley's easy lyrical style and bravura technique.'' Donald Walbridge Shirley was born in Pensacola, Fla., on Jan. 29, 1927. His father, Edwin, was an Episcopal priest, and family lore has it that young Donald was playing the organ in church at age 3. His mother, the former Stella Gertrude Young, a teacher, died when Donald was 9. He studied music at the Catholic University of America in Washington. He was married once and divorced. He is survived by a brother, Maurice, and a half-sister, Edwina Shirley Nalchawee. Mr. Shirley made a number of recordings in the 1950s and early '60s for the Cadence label, including ''Piano Perspectives,'' ''Don Shirley Plays Love Songs,'' ''Don Shirley Plays Gershwin'' and ''Don Shirley Plays Shirley.'' Later in the 1960s, he recorded with Columbia. It was the founder of Cadence Records, Archie Bleyer, who insisted that Mr. Shirley be called Don, an informality that stuck with him throughout his career as a nettlesome reminder that he was unable to be known as the concert player he had always wished to be. Jazz piano players, Mr. Shirley told The Times in 1982, when he was appearing at the Cookery in Greenwich Village, ''smoke while they're playing, and they'll put the glass of whisky on the piano, and then they'll get mad when they're not respected like Arthur Rubinstein. You don't see Arthur Rubinstein smoking and putting a glass on the piano.'' He added: ''I am not an entertainer. But I'm running the risk of being considered an entertainer by going into a nightclub because that's what they have in there. I don't want anybody to know me well enough to slap me on the back and say, 'Hey, baby.' The black experience through music, with a sense of dignity, that's all I have ever tried to do.''"

35158,"Ernest Borgnine, Tough but Tender Actor, Dies at 95","Ernest Borgnine, the rough-hewn actor who seemed destined for tough-guy characters but won an Academy Award for embodying the gentlest of souls, a lonely Bronx butcher, in the 1955 film ''Marty,'' died on Sunday in Los Angeles.","Ernest Borgnine, the rough-hewn actor who seemed destined for tough-guy characters but won an Academy Award for embodying the gentlest of souls, a lonely Bronx butcher, in the 1955 film ''Marty,'' died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 95. His death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was announced by Harry Flynn, his longtime spokesman. Mr. Borgnine, who later starred on ''McHale's Navy'' on television, made his first memorable impression in films at age 37, appearing in ''From Here to Eternity'' (1953) as Fatso Judson, the sadistic stockade sergeant who beats Frank Sinatra's character, Private Maggio, to death. But Paddy Chayefsky, who wrote ''Marty'' as a television play, and Delbert Mann, who directed it (it starred Rod Steiger), saw something beyond brutality in Mr. Borgnine and offered him the title role when it was made into a feature film. The 1950s had emerged as the decade of the common man, with Willy Loman of ''Death of a Salesman'' on Broadway and the likes of the bus driver Ralph Kramden (''The Honeymooners'') and the factory worker Chester Riley (''The Life of Riley'') on television. Mr. Borgnine's Marty Pilletti, a 34-year-old blue-collar bachelor who still lives with his mother, fit right in, showing the tender side of the average, unglamorous guy next door. Marty's awakening, as he unexpectedly falls in love, was described by Bosley Crowther in The New York Times as ''a beautiful blend of the crude and the strangely gentle and sensitive in a monosyllabic man.'' Mr. Borgnine received the Oscar for best actor for ''Marty.'' For the same performance he also received a Golden Globe and awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Board of Review and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Mr. Borgnine won even wider fame as the star of the ABC sitcom ''McHale's Navy'' (1962-66), originating the role of an irreverent con man of a PT boat skipper. (The cast also included a young Tim Conway.) He wrote in his autobiography, ''Ernie'' (Citadel Press, 2008), that he had turned down the role because he refused to do a television series but changed his mind when a boy came to his door selling candy and said, although he knew who James Arness of ''Gunsmoke'' and Richard Boone of ''Have Gun, Will Travel'' were, he had never heard of Ernest Borgnine. Over a career that lasted more than six decades the burly, big-voiced Mr. Borgnine was never able to escape typecasting completely, at least in films. Although he did another Chayefsky screenplay, starring with Bette Davis as a working-class father of the bride in ''The Catered Affair'' (1956), and even appeared in a musical, ''The Best Things in Life Are Free'' (1956), playing a Broadway showman, the vast majority of the characters he played were villains. Military roles continued to beckon. One of his best known was as Lee Marvin's commanding officer in ''The Dirty Dozen'' (1967), about hardened prisoners on a World War II commando mission. He also starred in three television-movie sequels. But he worked in virtually every genre. Filmmakers cast him as a gangster, even in satirical movies like ''Spike of Bensonhurst'' (1988). He was in westerns like Sam Peckinpah's blood-soaked classic ''The Wild Bunch'' (1969) and crime dramas like ''Bad Day at Black Rock'' (1955). He played gruff police officers, like his character in the disaster blockbuster ''The Poseidon Adventure'' (1972), and bosses from hell, as in the horror movie ''Willard'' (1971). Twice he played a manager of gladiators, in ''Demetrius and the Gladiators'' (1954) and in the 1984 mini-series ''The Last Days of Pompeii.'' Mr. Borgnine's menacing features seemed to disappear when he flashed his trademark gaptoothed smile, and later in life he began to find good-guy roles, like the helpful taxi driver in ''Escape From New York'' (1981) and the title role in ''A Grandpa for Christmas,'' a 2007 television movie. ''McHale's Navy'' and the 1964 film inspired by it were his most notable forays into comedy, but in 1999 he began doing the voice of a recurring character, the elderly ex-superhero Mermaidman, in the animated series ''SpongeBob SquarePants.'' He continued to play that role until last year. He began his career on the stage but unlike many actors who had done the same, Mr. Borgnine professed to have no burning desire to return there. ''Once you create a character for the stage, you become like a machine,'' he told The Washington Post in 1969. In films, he said, ''you're always creating something new.'' Ermes Effron Borgnino was born on Jan. 24, 1917, in Hamden, Conn., near New Haven. His father was a railroad brakeman. His mother was said to be the daughter of a count, Paolo Boselli, an adviser to King Victor Emmanuel of Italy. The boy spent several years of his childhood in Italy, where his mother returned during a long separation from her husband. But they returned to Connecticut, and he graduated from high school there. He joined the Navy at 18 and served for 10 years. During World War II he was a gunner's mate. After the war he considered factory jobs, but his mother suggested that he try acting. Her reasoning, he reported, was, ''You've always liked making a damned fool of yourself.'' He studied at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford, then moved to Virginia, where he became a member of the Barter Theater in Abingdon and worked his way up from painting scenery to playing the Gentleman Caller in ''The Glass Menagerie.'' In the late 1940s he headed for New York, where by 1952 he was appearing on Broadway as a bodyguard in the comic fantasy ''Mrs. McThing,'' starring Helen Hayes. He had already made his movie debut playing a Chinese shopkeeper in the 1951 adventure ''China Corsair.'' Mr. Borgnine never retired from acting. In the 1980s he starred in another television series, the adventure drama ''Airwolf,'' playing a helicopter pilot. He took a supporting role as a bubbly doorman in the 1990s sitcom ''The Single Guy.'' His last film appearance was in ''The Man Who Shook the Hand of Vicente Fernandez,'' not yet released, in which he plays an elderly man who becomes a celebrity to Latino employees at the nursing home where he lives. On television, he was in the series finale of ''ER'' in 2009 and appeared in a cable film, ''Love's Christmas Journey,'' last year. His other films included ''The Vikings'' (1958); ''Ice Station Zebra'' (1968); ''Hoover'' (2000), in which he played J. Edgar Hoover; and ''Gattaca'' (1997). Mr. Borgnine, who lived in Beverly Hills, was married five times. In 1949 he married Rhoda Kemins, whom he had met when they were both in the Navy. They had a daughter but divorced in 1958. On New Year's Eve 1959 he and the Mexican-born actress Katy Jurado were married; they divorced in 1962. His third marriage was his most notorious because of its brevity. He and the Broadway musical star Ethel Merman married in late June 1964 but split up in early August. Mr. Borgnine later contended that Ms. Merman left because she was upset that on an international honeymoon trip he was recognized and she wasn't. In 1965 he married Donna Rancourt; they had two children before divorcing in 1972. In 1973 he married for the fifth and last time, to Tova Traesnaes, who under the name Tova Borgnine became a cosmetics entrepreneur. She survives him, as do his children, Christofer, Nancee and Sharon Borgnine; a stepson, David Johnson; six grandchildren; and his sister, Evelyn Verlardi. Asked about his acting methods in 1973, Mr. Borgnine told The New York Times: ''No Stanislavsky. I don't chart out the life histories of the people I play. If I did, I'd be in trouble. I work with my heart and my head, and naturally emotions follow.'' Sometimes he prayed, he said, or just reflected on character-appropriate thoughts. ''If none of that works,'' he added, ''I think to myself of the money I'm making.''"

She was 71. The cause was pulmonary and cardiac arrest, her husband, Gary, said, adding that she had never fully recovered from viral encephalitis contracted in 2005 and was in a nursing home. She retired in 2006. Ms. Bandy, who became director of MoMA's film department in 1980 and its chief curator in 1994, greatly expanded the museum's film collection and oversaw the construction of an $11.2 million preservation center for the archive in Pennsylvania. One hurdle she faced in saving older films, beyond the technical issues of restoration, was an early Hollywood convention of discarding a movie if there was no further profit to be made from it. Only about 10 percent of the films made from 1910 to 1920 and only 20 percent of the feature films made in the 1920s have survived intact, a 1993 report by the Library of Congress said. ''They thought of them as products like shoes,'' Ms. Bandy said in 1997 in ''The Race to Save 100 Years,'' a Turner Classic Movies documentary about the struggles to preserve decaying film. ''Once they were sold and run through their distribution process, they were finished.'' Ms. Bandy secured rare prints and negatives of films by silent-era directors like D. W. Griffith and Charlie Chaplin and early avant-garde filmmakers like Stan Brakhage and the artist Man Ray. She persuaded Jean-Luc Godard, Martin Scorsese and other contemporary directors to contribute prints of their films to MoMA. She also held screenings of many films from the archive and oversaw exhibitions like one in 2003 of Andy Warhol's Screen Tests, a series of short, silent, mid-1960s film portraits of dozens of notable people, including Susan Sontag, Bob Dylan, Marcel Duchamp and Lou Reed. In 1996 Ms. Bandy presided over the opening of the Celeste Bartos Film Preservation Center in Hamlin, Pa., in the Poconos near Scranton. The center stores MoMA's entire film archive, which now approaches 30,000 titles, many duplicates and millions of still photographs. The two-building, 36,000-square-foot complex has 56 climate-controlled vaults to keep the films in stable condition until they can undergo preservation. When it opened, The New York Times called it ''a cross between a library and a hospital.'' Mary Lea Gibson was born in Evanston, Ill., on June 16, 1943. She graduated from New Trier High School, north of Chicago, before studying art history at Stanford University. She went to New York in 1965 to pursue graduate studies at Columbia University, where she met Gary Bandy, an artist. They married in 1967. Besides her husband, she is survived by a brother, DeWitt Clinton Gibson III, and a sister, Barbara Peters. Ms. Bandy went to work in publishing rather than complete her graduate work. She joined MoMA's publications department in 1973. In 2012 she and the film scholar Kevin Stoehr collaborated on ''Ride, Boldly Ride: The Evolution of the American Western,'' published by University of California Press. The foreword is by Clint Eastwood, all of whose work is preserved by MoMA."

Development Program","Hans Wolfgang Singer, an economist who devoted his life to analyzing the causes and effects of poverty and helped create the World Food Program and the United Nations Development Program, died in his sleep on Feb. 26 in Brighton, England.","Hans Wolfgang Singer, an economist who devoted his life to analyzing the causes and effects of poverty and helped create the World Food Program and the United Nations Development Program, died in his sleep on Feb. 26 in Brighton, England. He was 95. His death was announced by the University of Sussex, where he last worked. Sir Hans, who was knighted in 1994, was best known for his work on the effects of trade on developing nations. He argued that long-term trade agreements favor developed countries, resulting in falling prices for commodities produced by poorer nations, an idea that came to be known as the Prebisch-Singer thesis. He was born in 1910 in the Rhineland to a middle-class family. Originally he was to follow in his father's footsteps and become a doctor. But he turned to economics instead, drawn by a desire to understand the forces behind Germany's great inflation of 1923 and depression of 1930 and 1931, according to his biographer, John Shaw. As Nazi persecution of Jews increased, he fled Germany in 1933. He had been studying at Bonn University there, and he sought asylum in Britain. He became one of the Cambridge Ph.D students of the economist John Maynard Keynes. Like Keynes, Sir Hans ''treated economics as a moral science,'' noted A. P. Thirlwall, professor of applied economics at the University of Kent in Canterbury. For a study of poverty in Britain, Sir Hans lived with unemployed families and theorized that the loss of dignity that went with lack of work was as serious a problem as unemployment itself. In 1947, he joined the United Nations from Glasgow University, where he began studying the theories on trade and developing nations that earned him renown in economic circles. He spent 22 years at the United Nations, advocating changes to the treatment of developing nations, like giving aid in the form of food. After retiring from the United Nations, he took a fellowship at the Institute for Development Studies in Sussex University, where he published 30 books. Sir Hans was married to Ilse Lina Plaut, a feminist and fund-raiser, for 67 years until her death in 2001. He is survived by a son."

59278,"Thomas Polgar, C.I.A. Officer, Dies at 91; Helped Lead U.S. Evacuation of Saigon","Saigon was falling and the United States was fleeing, desperately evacuating the last of its embassy staff and C.I.A.","Saigon was falling and the United States was fleeing, desperately evacuating the last of its embassy staff and C.I.A. officers in the final, chaotic hours of April 1975. With the airport under siege by the North Vietnamese, helicopters landed on rooftops to ferry away Americans and some South Vietnamese. Thomas Polgar, the Saigon station chief for the C.I.A., helped lead the effort, lifting people over fences and destroying files. Just before Mr. Polgar destroyed the cable-sending machine the agency had used to communicate, just before he boarded a helicopter himself, he took a moment to type a last dispatch. ''This will be final message from Saigon station,'' Mr. Polgar wrote. ''It has been a long and hard fight and we have lost. This experience, unique in the history of the United States, does not signal necessarily the demise of the United States as a world power. ''The severity of the defeat and the circumstances of it, however, would seem to call for a reassessment of the policies of niggardly half-measures which have characterized much of our participation here despite the commitment of manpower and resources, which were certainly generous. Those who fail to learn from history are forced to repeat it. Let us hope that we will not have another Vietnam experience and that we have learned our lesson.'' He concluded, ''Saigon signing off.'' The capital of South Vietnam was soon renamed Ho Chi Minh City, and Mr. Polgar, who was 91 when he died on March 22 in Winter Park, Fla., was reassigned to Mexico City. When he retired from the C.I.A. in 1981, his last few months in Vietnam continued to define a career in espionage that began during World War II. ''He really is the last of the original C.I.A. officers who started with the agency in 1947 and lived through its heyday until the fall of Saigon in 1975,'' Tim Weiner, the author of ''Legacy of Ashes,'' a history of the C.I.A. that recounts some of Mr. Polgar's time in Vietnam, wrote in an email. Mr. Polgar, who was born in Hungary and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1943, began working in intelligence soon after the Army drafted him late in World War II. He worked in the Office of Strategic Services before moving to the C.I.A. after it was formed in 1947. In the 1950s, he helped lead spying operations in Berlin. After spending the 1960s based in Vienna and Washington, he moved in 1970 to Buenos Aires, where the next year he helped end a hijacking by boarding the plane and talking with the hijacker. By the end of 1971, he was in Asia preparing to take over the post in Saigon. American troops withdrew from Vietnam in 1973 under the Paris Peace Accords. The United States hoped that, with a very small military presence, several hundred C.I.A. operatives and American financial support, South Vietnam could be preserved as an independent state. But by early 1975, the financial support had been substantially reduced and the North Vietnamese had begun a major offensive in the south. Saigon, the last redoubt of the South Vietnamese government, was under direct siege on April 29, leading to the dramatic but incomplete evacuation. Thousands of South Vietnamese whom the United States had promised to evacuate were left behind. Mr. Polgar -- along with the American ambassador at the time, Graham A. Martin, and Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger -- were later accused of not recognizing the seriousness of the new threat from the North Vietnamese, of believing for too long that a negotiated settlement could be reached, and of waiting too long to evacuate. In his 1977 book ''Decent Interval,'' Frank Snepp, a top C.I.A. officer who had been based in Saigon, accused Mr. Polgar of withholding important information from Washington officials, such as intelligence that made clear the futility of negotiating with the North Vietnamese. Mr. Polgar said at the time that he held Mr. Snepp ''in the highest regard,'' but that ''what he's giving is the private's view of the war.'' Mr. Polgar was born on July 24, 1922, in Budapest. His parents were Jewish and moved the family to the United States in 1938 to escape Nazi oppression. He studied accounting at a business school in New York, graduating in 1942. He is survived by his wife, the former Anna Fain, whom he married in 1977; three children from a previous marriage, Thomas, Patricia Polgar-Bailey and Catherine Jordan; and four grandchildren. His wife confirmed his death. Mr. Polgar received numerous awards for his C.I.A. service. After he retired, he worked in a range of positions in Washington, including, in the late 1980s, as a top investigator on the Senate select committee looking into the Iran-contra affair."

Horwich, the amiable educator who engaged millions of preschoolers as the host of the pioneering children's program ""Ding Dong School"" in the 1950's, died yesterday.","Frances R. Horwich, the amiable educator who engaged millions of preschoolers as the host of the pioneering children's program ""Ding Dong School"" in the 1950's, died yesterday. She was 93. Ringing an old-fashioned school bell to start the show, she would look into the camera, warmly wish a good morning and ask, ""How are you today?"" She paused so that toddlers at home, watching a somewhat matronly figure in swept-back hair and wearing a wool jacket, could answer. And they often did, thanks to her kindly, conversational style. Then, ""Miss Frances"" would tell stories or demonstrate activities, like making pipe-cleaner figures or clay models. She used inexpensive, familiar toys and interspersed her presentation with unobtrusive lessons: ""Ask your mother where to play with it,"" for a homemade musical instrument. ""Be sure your sleeves are rolled up,"" for a messier project. The half-hour show ended with a five-minute summation of the material. ""Ding Dong School"" began on a Chicago station, WNBQ, in 1952. It was so popular that after six weeks, NBC picked up the program, and soon it was seen in at least 36 cities, with viewership reaching three million. The program was broadcast live at 10 a.m. on weekdays for four years, going to WNET in New York in 1959. ""Ding Dong School,"" directed and produced by Reinald Werrenrath Jr., was one of a series of high-quality, innovative broadcasts by WNBQ that became its own of golden age of television, said Jeff Kisseloff, a television historian. Unlike many of the children's show hosts of the period, Ms. Horwich ""actually taught kids things,"" Mr. Kisseloff said. And rather than the ""high-tech, dazzly stuff"" of today, ""it was her sitting in front of a piano or a drawing table,"" he said. ""The intent was to educate the kids plainly and straightforwardly,"" he said. ""The fact was that it worked. You didn't need all the bells and whistles to keep kids watching."" Its daily competitors at the time were ""Captain Kangaroo"" on CBS and ""Mickey Mouse Theater"" on ABC. A few years later, the successors to ""Ding Dong School"" appeared: ""Sesame Street"" and ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood."" In her era, a far simpler time when there was no Cartoon Network or hip, irony-tinged children's programs, Ms. Horwich won acclaim. She received a George Foster Peabody award in 1953. ""She imbues in the youngsters a sense of friendliness, confidence and faith that is truly magical television,"" The New York Times television critic, Jack Gould, wrote that year. ""She is a teacher, yes, but she is also a very genuine friend of the tots who sit entranced before the receivers."" When she began promoting the products of sponsors, however, Mr. Gould called the step ""heartbreaking."" ""The program is too important in too many homes to be allowed to go astray through regrettable short-sightedness,"" he wrote. In interviews, Ms. Horwich seemed better at saying what children's programming should not be. ""I don't think a television program should make a child's life complicated,"" she said in a 1955 interview. ""It should not get him into trouble with his parents. Sometimes very innocently a television program teaches a child a trick that is not socially acceptable and, therefore, gets him into trouble. It is not socially acceptable to throw a pie at someone or to fill someone's hat with water,"" she added, perhaps a not-so-subtle jab at Bozo the Clown. She also deplored the violence of Westerns and crime programs, though added that normal children could handle it. What television should do is appeal to their interests, open ""new doors and windows"" of enlightenment and help children learn to be resourceful, Ms. Horwich said. Frances Rappaport was born in Ottawa, Ohio, on July 16, 1908, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1929. She earned her doctorate in education from Northwestern University in 1942. In 1931, she married Harvey L. Horwich, who was later a technical consultant to the United States Air Force. Mr. Horwich died in the early 1970's. The couple had no children. For more than two decades before first ringing the ""Ding Dong"" bell, Ms. Horwich worked in education. She taught first grade, supervised nursery schools in Chicago, was a principal, and held professorships in education at the University of North Carolina and Roosevelt College in Chicago. But her biggest class was filled with the millions of children in America's living rooms born just a few years after World War II. ""Our little school gives them a sense of belonging,"" she said."
29072,"Wayne Jackson, 74, Memphis Horns Trumpeter","Wayne Jackson, a trumpet player who, with the tenor saxophonist Andrew Love, helped define the soul sound of Stax Records and, playing with Mr. Love as the Memphis Horns, provided backup on a long list of classic R&B and pop records, died on Tuesday in Memphis.","Wayne Jackson, a trumpet player who, with the tenor saxophonist Andrew Love, helped define the soul sound of Stax Records and, playing with Mr. Love as the Memphis Horns, provided backup on a long list of classic R&B and pop records, died on Tuesday in Memphis. He was 74. The cause was congestive heart failure, his wife, Amy Jackson, said. Mr. Jackson had his first gold record when he was still in high school, performing on the instrumental ''Last Night'' with the Mar-Keys. Released in 1961, it rose to No. 3 on the pop charts and was included on the first album issued by Stax, a label that helped create the Memphis sound in soul music. As part of the house band at Stax, with Booker T. and the M.G.'s, the Mar-Keys played on records by Otis Redding, Eddie Floyd, Sam and Dave, Albert King, and Carla and Rufus Thomas. At American Sound Studio in Memphis and FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Ala., Mr. Jackson and Mr. Love performed with artists including Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and Percy Sledge. After incorporating themselves in 1969 as the Memphis Horns, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Love became roving ambassadors of the Memphis sound, in constant demand by artists as varied as Elvis Presley, Al Green, Rod Stewart, Steve Winwood, Bonnie Raitt, U2 and Willie Nelson. At the 2012 Grammy Awards, when the Memphis Horns were presented with a lifetime achievement award, Neil Portnow, the president of the Recording Academy, called them ''the breath of soul.'' Wayne Lamar Jackson was born on Nov. 24, 1941, in Memphis and grew up across the Mississippi River in West Memphis, Ark. He got his first trumpet when he was 11. ''I opened up the case, and it smelled like oil and brass,'' he wrote on his website. ''I loved that, so I put it together, blew, and out came a pretty noise.'' In high school he began playing with the Royal Spades, an early version of the Mar-Keys, whose members included Steve Cropper, later the guitarist for Booker T. and the M.G.'s., and Charles Axton, known as Packy, a tenor saxophonist whose mother and uncle founded Stax. When Mr. Axton left Stax in 1964, Mr. Jackson went to a local club to hear Mr. Love, who was playing with Willie Mitchell's band. ''I knew we would be perfect together,'' Mr. Jackson said in a statement released after Mr. Love died in 2012. ''He had a big tone and I had a big tone, and I knew that they would blend in the most natural, beautiful way.'' The two men played on nearly every record released by Stax. At American Sound Studio, operated by the producer Chips Moman, who died on June 13, they lent their one-two punch to Presley's hits ''In the Ghetto'' and ''Suspicious Minds,'' Dusty Springfield's ''Dusty in Memphis'' album and Neil Diamond's ''Sweet Caroline.'' Working with Mr. Mitchell at Hi Records, they played on the Al Green hits ''Tired of Being Alone'' and ''Let's Stay Together.'' The Memphis Horns toured and recorded with the Doobie Brothers, Robert Cray, Jimmy Buffett and Joe Cocker and recorded several of its own albums, including ''The Memphis Horns'' (1970) and ''Flame Out'' (1992). Mr. Jackson's first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a brother, Bruce; a sister, Sara Leaptrot; and four children, Carla Lee, Duane Jackson, Jennifer Jackson and Brittany Harris. ''Me and that trumpet had it all,'' Mr. Jackson told American Blues Scene magazine in 2014. ''That was my ticket. I punched that ticket and I rode that bus.''"

Gambling, a popular morning radio personality in New York who for 31 years was the host of ""Rambling With Gambling"" on WOR, offering a low-key version of the news and a folksy banter to go with cornflakes and the drive to work, died on Thursday night at Bon Secours Hospital in Venice, Fla.","John A. Gambling, a popular morning radio personality in New York who for 31 years was the host of ""Rambling With Gambling"" on WOR, offering a low-key version of the news and a folksy banter to go with cornflakes and the drive to work, died on Thursday night at Bon Secours Hospital in Venice, Fla. He was 73 and had been a resident of Boca Grande, Fla., since his retirement 13 years ago. The cause was a heart attack, said his son, John R. Gambling. Mr. Gambling was the second of three generations of Gamblings that held forth on WOR-AM Radio for 75 years. Their news-and-talk show became the longest-running program in history and a model for morning programming on radio and television. His father, John B. Gambling, began the show's forerunner in 1925. When he retired in 1959, John A. took over, and he was succeeded in 1990 by his son, John R., who was the host until the program was discontinued in 2000. For loyal audiences in the millions, ""Rambling With Gambling"" seemed as reliable as the dawn, and John A. Gambling as familiar as an old friend at the breakfast table: a warmhearted optimist who broadcast news and sports, traffic reports and school closings in a calm, easygoing baritone. On the air Monday to Saturday, usually from 5 to 10 a.m., he interviewed ordinary people in the news as well as politicians and celebrities, but avoided controversy and strident opinions. ""I believe the morning is bad enough as it is,"" he told Time magazine in his heyday. ""I don't want to talk about anything that's going to offend anyone."" Unlike brassier rivals who delivered blunt talk and sexual humor on other stations, Mr. Gambling spoke often of church dinners, school fairs and everyday problems, like a car that wouldn't start on a cold morning. He evoked a small-town feeling, listeners said, often mentioning his wife, Sally, and their three children, and audiences came to know the Gambling family like neighbors. There were occasional program innovations: his was the first radio show to carry helicopter traffic reports, and though music, a staple of his father's programs, was dropped, movie reviews were added. When hard language became common on the air, he sometimes uttered a ""hell"" or ""damn."" But quiet dignity was his stock in trade, and his listeners responded with loyalty. In a city where some 50 radio stations vie for listeners, the Gambling show never ranked lower than third, and sometimes was second with 7 percent of the audience -- some 237,000 people in a 20-county, city-and-suburb radius, surpassed only by all-news WINS. Mr. Gambling, whose million-dollar-a-year salary was among the highest in radio, was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2000. John Albert Gambling was born in Manhattan on Feb. 5, 1930. His English-born father, John Bradley Gambling, was an engineer at WOR Radio in 1925 when Bernarr Macfadden, the physical culturalist, failed to show up one day for his exercise program and he filled in so adeptly that he was soon given his own program, called ""Gambling's Musical Clock."" It became a morning staple and was renamed ""Rambling With Gambling"" in 1942. John A., who made his radio debut at age 4 singing a Christmas carol on his father's show, grew up in Manhattan and Massapequa, N.Y., where the family had a summer home and where his lifelong love of sailing began on Great South Bay. At Dartmouth, he worked on the college radio station and graduated with a degree in drama. He went to work at WOR as his father's assistant and succeeded him as host in 1959. John B. Gambling died in 1974. The son's show was similar to the father's: a mix of news, music, weather, traffic reports and mellow talk of family matters -- birthdays of grandchildren, holidays, weddings and other occasions. With the intimacy of radio, he often touched his audience deeply. ""He had a marvelous sense of making you feel that he was in your living room,"" one fan recalled. It came naturally, colleagues said. ""What you hear on the air is what he is off the air,"" said Don Criqui, his sportscaster. Bob Bruno, WOR's vice president and general manager, said the Gambling show widely influenced morning radio in the 1960's and 70's and today's television. ""It became the model for much of popular morning radio,"" he said yesterday, ""and then television said, 'Hey look, we can put a camera on this.' "" Over three decades, as television eclipsed radio in mass markets, the show retained its share of listeners, but the audience gradually grew older. A 1989 survey showed that a typical 15-minute segment had 236,000 listeners and that 59 percent were 65 or older, exceeding the ages that most advertisers seek. John R. Gambling became the show's co-host in 1985, and the host when his father retired in 1990. In recent years, he has been the host of a weekly WABC radio show and regularly interviews Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. In addition to his son, of Locust Valley, N.Y., Mr. Gambling is survived by his wife, the former Sally Loppacker; two daughters, Ann Hoffman of Bedford, N.Y., and Sarah McGayhey of Shelter Island, N.Y., and seven grandchildren. A public memorial tribute is scheduled for Thursday, Jan. 22, at 12:30 P.M. at Brick Presbyterian Church, Park Avenue and 91st Street."

56212,Summits: Not Empty at All,"What began 14 years ago as a narrowly economic summit meeting was leavened this year by politics - to everyone's benefit. Indeed, this time the seven leaders glossed over the economic issues that divide them.","What began 14 years ago as a narrowly economic summit meeting was leavened this year by politics - to everyone's benefit. Indeed, this time the seven leaders glossed over the economic issues that divide them. But they found new direction and common purpose on broader issues, most notably how to deal with rapid change in Eastern Europe. President Mitterrand tried to make this year's meeting grander by inviting third world leaders to share the bicentennial Bastille Day's froth. There was more posturing for cameramen than meaningful North-South mixing. Even so, summit meetings do no harm, and this one did some good. The first summit meeting, in 1975, was an intimate, informal weekend in the French countryside to exchange thoughts on the then-soaring price of oil, currency exchange rates and trade. These annual get-togethers have since grown coldly formal, for the most part. But this year economics, politics and the interests of all seven nations came together on two major issues outside the strictly economic -Eastern Europe and the global environment. On the environment, the seven were more loquacious than specific. They devoted a third of their communique to the urgency of ecological threats, but set no program. On Eastern Europe, they were constructive and even spontaneous. President Bush arrived in Paris full of enthusiasm after a brief visit to Poland and Hungary. But he wisely refrained from trying to control the follow-up in Paris. He assumed correctly that the Western European allies would offer direct financial aid equal to or exceeding his own modest commitments to help develop private enterprise. The seven easily agreed to coordinate direct assistance for both countries, and to ease Poland's foreign debt burden in exchange for structural reforms. Unexpectedly, they assigned the coordination to the European Community's executive commission. More than mere bureaucratic convenience, this new role acknowledges that the community is becoming a power itself. And more than just mouthing good intentions, the seven set a meeting of all interested countries, not just themselves or community members, in the next few weeks. They also agreed to address Poland's ''urgent need for food'' - a clear recognition that the whole effort to achieve democratic reform will founder without a quick response to Poland's food shortages. Summit meetings bring the leaders face to face for concentrated conversation that even the best of modern communications cannot match. More's the pity that they did not spend more time in Paris on old problems - the third world's agonizing debt, and mounting trade frictions among themselves. But the time was not wasted. New policies for new openings in Eastern Europe need careful development, and protection for the world's environment needs leadership from the top. The Paris summit conference was an appropriate forum for setting the pace on both."

54006,"Joan McCord, Who Evaluated Anticrime Efforts, Dies at 73","Joan McCord, a criminologist who marshaled mountains of evidence to question the effectiveness of social programs championed by both liberals and conservatives, died Tuesday at her home in Narberth, Pa. She was 73.","Joan McCord, a criminologist who marshaled mountains of evidence to question the effectiveness of social programs championed by both liberals and conservatives, died Tuesday at her home in Narberth, Pa. She was 73. The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Robert. In 12 books and many other writings, Dr. McCord, a professor at Temple University, disputed the effectiveness in fighting crime of boys' clubs, summer camps, programs in which young offenders visit prisons, D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) and other popular programs. The first woman to be president of the American Society of Criminology, she was known for her use of longitudinal studies, which follow subjects for many years. Her goal was to examine the long-term effects of programs, ranging from individual mentoring programs often favored by conservatives to social work efforts frequently advocated by liberals. Dr. McCord believed that just as the government monitors the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, the public should examine data to determine if well-meaning interventions to help people might, in fact, be harmful. Often, she found that programs had no built-in procedure to evaluate their success. More troubling, she said, was that officials sometimes resisted evaluation of programs, in part because they regarded it as an affront to their good intentions. She also said she sensed a fear that solid criticism of one social program might brand all as ineffective. ''That fear, perhaps justified in some quarters, would be like blocking publication of damaging effects of Celebrex, thalidomide, or estrogen because the publication could slow work in disease prevention,'' she wrote in the May 2003 issue of The Annals, the publication of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. Her best-known longitudinal study was her 1978 follow-up on a youth-mentoring program done 30 years earlier in Cambridge and Somerville, Mass. She found that boys at high risk who had been given mentors, health-care services and summer camp fared worse in later life than a similar group of boys who were given nothing special. The 250 boys who got special services were more likely to become criminals, have trouble in their jobs and marriages, and become alcoholics, according to court, hospital and other records noted in her study. A possible reason, Dr. McCord suggested, was that those boys had felt they were given the attention because something was wrong with them, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Her theory was that the boys who went to summer camp modeled themselves after camp troublemakers. The counterintuitive result contradicted the statements of two-thirds of the participants that the program had helped them by giving them better values and keeping them off the streets. In other studies, she found that some youths counseled by court-appointed volunteers fared worse than those who received no counseling. Her statistical analysis of a program in Australia that provided recreation for troubled adolescents found bad effects. And participants in the Scared Straight program, which takes young offenders from many locales to visit prisons, were arrested more often than a control group, she found. She said that D.A.R.E., the popular nationwide ''just say no'' drug education program in which law enforcement officers spend time in schools talking about drugs, alcohol and violence, may actually have contributed to drug use, according to her analysis of statistics from the program. Joan Fish was born in Manhattan on Aug. 4, 1930. After graduating from Stanford in 1952, she did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard and Stanford. She earned her doctorate in sociology from Stanford in 1968. She wrote some of her early papers with her first husband, William M. McCord. Their marriage ended in divorce. Both he and her second husband, Carl A. Silver, are dead. Dr. McCord is survived by her sons, Geoffrey Sayre-McCord of Durham, N.C., and Robert McCord of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; her ward, whom she regarded as a family member, Tom Underwood of Boston; her brother, Robert Fish of Santa Cruz, Calif.; her sister, Connie Arnosti of Milwaukee; and four grandsons. Her often pithy remarks appeared in articles about crime in many newspapers and magazines. The New York Times in 1996 asked her about a 12-year-old arrested on charges of gang rape and murder and who was turned in by his mother. Of the mother's dilemma, Dr. McCord said, ''It's almost impossible to imagine a good thing to do with a gun-toting 12-year-old.''"

44631,"Richard Matheson, Writer of Haunted Science Fiction and Horror, Dies at 87","Richard Matheson, whose novels, short stories, screenplays and teleplays drew the blueprints for dozens of science fiction and horror movies and television shows, died on Sunday at his home in Calabasas, Calif.","Richard Matheson, whose novels, short stories, screenplays and teleplays drew the blueprints for dozens of science fiction and horror movies and television shows, died on Sunday at his home in Calabasas, Calif. He was 87. His death was confirmed by his son Richard Christian, known as R. C. Mr. Matheson had a prolific imagination for the ''what if?'' story, and he drew his ideas from both actual events and other stories. After the unsettling experience of being tailgated by a truck driver, he wrote the short story ''Duel,'' about a motorist who is relentlessly stalked in a highway chase by a tractor-trailer, its driver unseen. The story became the basis for Steven Spielberg's first feature film, starring Dennis Weaver. An early novel, and perhaps his best-known work, ''I Am Legend,'' about the last surviving human in a world in which everyone else is a vampire, was published in 1954 and adapted in 1964 as ''The Last Man on Earth'' with Vincent Price, in 1971 as ''The Omega Man'' with Charlton Heston and in 2007 as ''I Am Legend'' with Will Smith. Mr. Matheson was inspired to write it while watching the 1931 film version of ''Dracula.'' ''My mind drifted off, and I thought, 'If one vampire is scary, what if the whole world is full of vampires?' '' Mr. Matheson said in an interview with the Archive of American Television. In a widely distributed statement, Stephen King, who acknowledged Mr. Matheson as an influence, said: ''Matheson fired the imaginations of three generations of writers. Without his 'I Am Legend,' there would have been no 'Night of the Living Dead'; without ''Night of the Living Dead,' there would have been no 'Walking Dead,' '28 Days Later' or 'World War Z'.'' Mr. Matheson's 1956 novel ''The Shrinking Man,'' a frightening fantasy about a man whose simultaneous exposure to insecticide and radioactivity causes him to dwindle gradually in size, was adapted twice for the movies -- once as a horror story, ''The Incredible Shrinking Man'' (1957), and once as a comedy starring Lily Tomlin, ''The Incredible Shrinking Woman'' (1981). In the late 1990s two of his books, ''A Stir of Echoes,'' a ghost story, and ''What Dreams May Come,'' about a man adrift in the afterlife, were also made into feature films, starring Kevin Bacon and Robin Williams respectively. Another novel, ''Hell House'' (1971), about four people investigating paranormal activity in what one character describes as ''the Mount Everest of haunted houses,'' became the 1973 film ''The Legend of Hell House,'' starring Roddy McDowall. The book showed off Mr. Matheson's gift for creepy atmospherics. ''Edith turned and saw a body of water ahead, a gravel path curving to its left,'' Mr. Matheson wrote, describing a character's first approach to the house. ''The surface of the water looked like clouded gelatin sprinkled with a thin debris of leaves and grass. A miasma of decay hovered above it, and the stones which lined it shore were green with slime.'' Mr. Matheson sometimes wrote the screenplays for the adaptations of his books, including ''Duel'' and ''The Legend of Hell House''; he adapted Edgar Allan Poe stories for several films, including ''House of Usher,'' ''Pit and the Pendulum'' and ''Tales of Terror''; and he wrote the screenplay for the 1965 film ''Die! Die! My Darling!,'' which starred Tallulah Bankhead as a grieving, demented mother who terrorizes the young woman she blames for her son's death. Mr. Matheson was also a busy television writer. He wrote for westerns like ''Have Gun, Will Travel,'' ''Cheyenne'' and ''Lawman,'' and for the war drama ''Combat!'' But he was mostly known for his work on science fiction and thriller series: ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ''Star Trek'' and especially ''The Twilight Zone,'' for which he wrote more than a dozen episodes, including the classic ''Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,'' which starred William Shatner as an airplane passenger who spies a gremlin on the wing bent on crippling the plane. Recalling the genesis of that episode, Mr. Matheson said: ''I was on an airplane and I looked out and there were all these fluffy clouds and I thought, 'Gee, what if I saw a guy skiing across that like it was snow?,' because it looked like snow. But when I thought it over, that's not very scary, so I turned it into a gremlin out on the wing.'' Mr. King wrote in a brief e-mail Tuesday that Mr. Matheson ''was a seminal figure in the horror and fantasy genres, as important in his way as Poe or Lovecraft.'' In his statement he wrote: ''He fired my imagination by placing his horrors not in European castles and Lovecraftian universes, but in American scenes I knew and could relate to. 'I want to do that,' I thought. 'I must do that.' Matheson showed the way.'' Richard Burton Matheson was born in Allendale, N.J., on Feb. 20, 1926, and grew up in Brooklyn. His parents were Norwegian immigrants; his father, Bertolf, installed tile flooring and helped operate speakeasies during Prohibition. A voracious reader as a boy, Mr. Matheson graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School. He served in the Army in Europe during World War II, an experience that was the source of his novel ''The Beardless Warriors.'' He studied journalism at the University of Missouri, after which he began writing fiction in earnest. For a time he worked at Douglas Aircraft. He published his first genre story, ''Born of Man and Woman,'' about a young couple who give birth to a monster and keep him in the cellar, in 1950. Mr. Matheson married Ruth Ann Woodson in 1952. She survives him. Besides his son R. C., he is also survived by another son, Christian; two daughters, Bettina Matheson Mayberry and Ali Marie Matheson; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Asked if his father, with whom he ran an entertainment company, had a motto or a saying that he lived by, R. C. Matheson said that he had kept a sign above his desk that read, ''That which you think becomes your world.''"

16530,"Raymond Weil, Whose Swiss Watches Told More Than Time, Dies at 87","Swiss watch companies had dominated the world of precision timekeeping for two centuries by the 1970s, when a technological marvel known as the quartz watch -- a cheaper, more accurate work of horology mass-produced in Asia -- threatened them with extinction.","Swiss watch companies had dominated the world of precision timekeeping for two centuries by the 1970s, when a technological marvel known as the quartz watch -- a cheaper, more accurate work of horology mass-produced in Asia -- threatened them with extinction. Between 1970 and 1983, as watch buyers abandoned windup mechanical timepieces for digital ones, the Swiss lost half their watch companies, two-thirds of their watchmaking jobs and their unrivaled authority as the world's most reliable timekeepers. Industry analysts called it the ''quartz crisis.'' Raymond Weil, who died at 87 on Jan. 26 in the Swiss city of Calvin, started a watch company that bore his name in the midst of all that, joining a watchmaking vanguard that saved the nation's signature product by redefining it. Swiss watches had been marketed as symbols of intellectual rigor and personal integrity. Beginning in the late 1970s, Mr. Weil and major Swiss watchmakers like Nicolas G. Hayek, founder of the Swatch Group, sought to reposition them as paragons of haute fashion -- ''an emotional product, carrying a message about the authenticity, uniqueness and excellence of the wearer,'' said Ryan L. Raffaelli, an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School who has studied the Swiss watchmaking industry. By the late 1980s, Professor Raffaelli said, the Swiss companies still standing had followed suit. Mr. Weil started his company in 1976, when he was 50. He began modestly, selling his first designs from a foldout bridge table in a stall in Geneva, he said in a 2011 company promotional video interview. Most people in the industry considered it a mad scheme, Professor Raffaelli said; about 800 Swiss watchmaking companies died in the 1970s. Mr. Weil, who led the company for about 20 years, combined high-quality mechanisms produced in his own and other Swiss factories with original designs and features. He then marketed them internationally to appeal to so-called entry-level luxury buyers. In today's dollars, entry-level luxury watches sell for $500 to $4,000. High-end luxury models cost $20,000 or more. Mr. Weil's line included both mechanical Swiss watches of the spring-powered, cog-and-gear type and others powered by quartz crystals, known as Swiss quartz watches. What they all had in common were their ''Swiss-made'' bona fides; design values that conveyed understated grace (what The Times of London characterized as a ''watch with lovely manners''); and the benefit of Mr. Weil's marketing. Mr. Weil was also considered a pioneer in celebrity-endorsement advertising. Paul McCartney, Lady Gaga, Ozzy Osbourne and Andrea Bocelli are among the stars who have been contracted to wear Raymond Weil watches exclusively for defined periods. The company, now run by Mr. Weil's son-in-law, Olivier Bernheim, and two grandsons, Elie and Pierre Bernheim, has become one of the most familiar of the Swiss watch brands. And in a Swiss industry with genealogies, in most cases, dating back a century or more, Raymond Weil is both the youngest and one of the few independent, family-run watchmaking concerns in the country. Since the 1980s, Swiss watchmakers have re-established their pre-eminence, at least in terms of sales: in a 2010 study, they accounted for just over half the dollar value of all watches sold worldwide. The most expensive are Swiss mechanical watches. Raymond Louis Weil was born in Geneva on Oct. 10, 1926. After graduating from a technical high school, he went to work for the Socit Gnrale de Surveillance (SGS), a Swiss company that inspects and verifies the quantity, weight and quality of various goods traded around the world. In 1949 he joined Camy Watch in Geneva and rose to general manager. He worked there for 27 years before deciding to strike out on his own, partly in frustration at his employer's passivity in response to the quartz crisis. Camy was later bought by a Hong Kong watchmaking company. Mr. Weil is survived by his wife, Eliane Bloch Weil, and two daughters, Diana and Anita Weil. Professor Raffaelli said the threat posed by the 1970s crisis was existential as well as economic. ''This was an industry that traced its roots to the early 1500s,'' he said. ''People employed in watchmaking in the 1970s had fathers, grandfathers, great-grandfathers and beyond, who had done the same work. ''Watchmaking was tied up in what it meant to be Swiss, the national sense of competence,'' he said. Mr. Weil, though not the son of a watchmaker, sensed the product's importance to the national identity. ''He was a kind of visionary,'' Professor Raffaelli said."
47435,Dr. Herman F. Mark Dies at 96; A Pioneer in Polymer Chemistry,"Dr. Herman F. Mark, a chemist who was a leader in research on polymers, giant long-chain molecules used in plastics and other materials affecting nearly all facets of life, died Monday in Austin, Tex.","Dr. Herman F. Mark, a chemist who was a leader in research on polymers, giant long-chain molecules used in plastics and other materials affecting nearly all facets of life, died Monday in Austin, Tex. He was 96 years old and moved to Texas two years ago from Brooklyn, where he was dean emeritus of Polytechnic University. Dr. Mark died after a brief illness at the home of his son, Dr. Hans M. Mark, chancellor of the University of Texas system, a statement from the university in Austin said. For more than 75 years, Herman Mark was in the forefront of polymer chemistry. Polymers, which can be both natural and man-made, are used in materials like plastics, fibers and films, as well as biological chemicals and materials. Papers, Books and Medals Professor Mark wrote more than 600 research papers and some 40 books on polymer chemistry. He was the recipient of scores of medals and honorary degrees. His many awards included the National Medal of Science of the United States, the Humboldt Medal of Germany, the Wolf Prize of Israel, the Legion of Honor of France and the Honor Cross for Arts and Sciences of his native Austria. Herman Francis Mark was born May 3, 1895, in Vienna, the son of a prominent physician. He served as a decorated combat infantry officer in the ski troops of the Austrian Army for four years in World War I. His career began in 1921 when he received a Ph.D. in organic chemistry at the University of Vienna. That year, he also married Maria Schramek and moved to Berlin to take a post at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry. Albert Einstein was only one of the prominent scientists at the institute then. In Berlin, Professor Mark developed the basic research processes from which his reputation subsequently grew. He did so by applying the techniques of modern physics to the study of large molecules. In 1928, he became director of the research laboratory of I.G. Farbenindustrie, the chemical conglomerate, in Friedrichshafen. There, he and his associates worked out the structure of the natural polymer molecule, as in cellulose, silk, cotton, wool and protein. It was the first time that the structure of an organic polymer in living things had been accurately defined. While involved in this research he was also teaching at the Technical University in Karlsruhe, where his students included Edward Teller, Leo Szilard and Eugene P. Wigner. When the Nazis took over in Germany in 1933, Professor Mark accepted an offer to become professor of chemistry and director of the Chemical Institute of the University of Vienna. His major contribution there was to explain the behavior of a natural polymeric substance like rubber. He and his student Eugene Guth developed what today is known as the kinetic theory of rubber elasticity. Under his leadership, polystyrene, a tough, clear, colorless plastic, and the first two synthetic rubbers were advanced toward commercial production. Another accomplishment was the Mark-Houwink equation, which became the basis for the measurement of molecular weights of polymers. Move to Brooklyn The annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938 prompted Professor Mark to start a journey that ended three years later in Brooklyn where he accepted a professorship at the Polytechnic Institute, now Polytechnic University. During World War II, he helped government agencies with projects involving synthetic rubbers, fibers and films. In 1944, the Polymer Institute was established at Polytechnic with him as its first director. It became a center for polymer research in the United States and achieved a systematic understanding of the mechanical properties of polymers. This enabled scientists to predict these properties and to tailor such substances to their intended use. That, in turn, made possible thousands of new plastics, fibers, paints and other materials produced by industry. Professor Mark left the directorship in 1961 to become dean of the faculty of Polytechnic. He became emeritus dean, professor and trustee in 1964. Professor Mark remained active in research and scholarly endeavors. In the 1980's, for instance, he led a study of fire- and temperature-resistant polymers used in aircraft, hotels and other public facilities. A member of the National Academy of Sciences, he also headed an academy panel in 1984 that reviewed the space program's use of high-temperature-resistant materials in rocket nozzles. Besides his son, Professor Mark is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Czitary of Vienna; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His wife died in 1970. A memorial symposium will be held on the Brooklyn campus of Polytechnic in the fall."

39976,"Oscar Ratnoff, 91, Expert on Blood Clots","Dr. Oscar D. Ratnoff, whose insightful research into how the blood coagulates helped reveal the ''waterfall'' biochemical response involved in the body's reaction to wounds and trauma, died on May 20 in Cleveland.","Dr. Oscar D. Ratnoff, whose insightful research into how the blood coagulates helped reveal the ''waterfall'' biochemical response involved in the body's reaction to wounds and trauma, died on May 20 in Cleveland. He was 91. The cause was respiratory failure, his family said. In the late 1950s and early '60s, Dr. Ratnoff, a hematologist at Case Western Reserve University, was able to isolate several of the blood proteins involved in coagulation, known as factors, and thereby helped unravel the biochemical sequence, called the waterfall sequence or waterfall cascade, that leads to effective clotting. Working with a biochemist, Earl W. Davie, Dr. Ratnoff studied a blood sample that had failed to coagulate in a laboratory test tube. The two scientists made comparisons with blood that exhibited normal clotting and succeeded in isolating a plasma protein, identified as Factor XII, lacking in the original sample. In later experiments, they isolated two other proteins, plasma thromboplastin antecedent (associated with Factor XI) and Factor IX, and came up with an important hypothesis. They proposed that proteins, lipids and calcium in the bloodstream act upon one another in a 13-element sequence to help construct a clot. In the process, they theorized, the proteins are converted into enzymes and contribute to the production of fibrin, an insoluble protein that is essential to coagulation. Then, they conjectured, in order for the body to make a healthy response to a wound, fibrin binds with blood cells to form an internal plug. Preliminary findings of Dr. Davie and Dr. Ratnoff were published in the journal Biochemistry in 1962, and were then more fully described in Science in 1964. Their results, along with related work by the British scientist R. G. MacFarland, were a groundbreaking step forward in the treatment of wounds, stroke and hemophilia. In the 1970s, before the advent of genetic testing, Dr. Ratnoff helped devise a more accurate method for detecting carriers of hemophilia, a hereditary blood-clotting disease that shows up in men but is genetically transmitted by women. With a colleague at Case Western, Dr. Theodore Zimmerman, Dr. Ratnoff adapted an existing technique to use an antiserum derived from rabbits and combine it with a blood factor. The test showed an accuracy level of about 95 percent, a significant improvement from the roughly 25 percent accuracy of earlier tests. In the 1980s, with the appearance of H.I.V., Dr. Ratnoff voiced concerns about the vulnerability of hemophiliacs, most of whom had been prescribed Factor VIII because they had congenital flaws in their waterfall sequences. A portion of the Factor VIII available commercially came from large-scale pooled blood donations, in what Dr. Ratnoff considered to be a dangerous avenue for the spread of hepatitis and AIDS. He observed that a drop in lymphocyte counts among hemophiliac patients suggested an increased susceptibility to blood-borne infections. Dr. Nathan A. Berger, a professor of experimental medicine, biochemistry and oncology at Case Western, and a former dean of its medical school, said that Dr. Ratnoff's objections were initially dismissed, because of the need to produce enough Factor VIII for the marketplace. ''But ultimately,'' Dr. Berger said, ''the medical community and the drug companies came to see his point and favor a single-donor approach. He was farsighted in that respect, and he had a voice that had to be listened to.'' In the 1990s, Dr. Ratnoff's argument became moot, as the Factor VIII protein was cloned and genetically engineered for the first time, eliminating the need for donated blood that might transmit disease to those who needed Factor VIII. The son of a prominent Brooklyn pediatrician, Oscar Davis Ratnoff was born in Manhattan. After receiving his medical degree from Columbia, he taught at Harvard and Johns Hopkins. He joined Case Western in 1952, was named a professor of medicine and remained active in his research until 2001. Dr. Ratnoff is survived by his wife of 63 years, Marian. The couple lived in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. He is also survived by a son, Dr. William Ratnoff, a rheumatologist, of Lubbock, Tex.; a daughter, Martha Fleisher of Dallas; and five grandchildren."

At 21, after completing design studies at Pratt Institute, she replaced her older sister Anna as head designer for Ben Girshel, then an important Seventh Avenue manufacturer. A few years later, she went to work for Mary Lee, another Seventh Avenue manufacturer. In 1949, she bought the company and renamed it Adele Simpson. As was the practice of the day, she traveled regularly to Paris to gather inspiration and copy French designs. Mrs. Simpson was the recipient of numerous fashion accolades, including the Coty American Fashion Critics award in 1947. For the wedding of President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Luci, in 1966, Mrs. Simpson designed for the mother of the bride a wrinkle-resistant yellow silk street-length coat, matching princess-line dress and hat. This ensemble, with it color coordination and clean, practical lines, was typical of Mrs. Simpson's concept of fashion. She continued designing into her 70's, retiring in 1985. Her daughter, Joan Raines, and son-in-law, Richard Raines, ran the business after her retirement. In 1991, the family sold the business to Barron Peters, a clothing company in Lowell, Mass., which has since filed for bankruptcy and discontinued the Adele Simpson line. Mrs. Simpson's husband died in 1976. In addition to her daughter, Joan, of Manhattan, Mrs. Simpson is survived by a son, Jeffrey, also of Manhattan, and three grandsons."

He was 77. His death, of cancer, was confirmed by Francine Pulliam, a longtime family friend. Former Senator Paul Laxalt, Republican of Nevada, recalled thinking that Mr. Hecht, a onetime Las Vegas clothing store owner, was ''half crazy'' when he ran for a State Senate seat in a heavily Democratic district in 1966. Mr. Hecht won that race, and went on to defeat United States Senator Howard Cannon, Democrat of Nevada, by a slim margin of 6,000 votes, after Mr. Cannon was caught up in a Teamsters union scandal. Mr. Hecht served one term in the Senate, and was defeated in his bid for a second term by Dick Bryan, a Democrat. He served for five years as the United States ambassador to the Bahamas, before returning to private business. In the Senate, Mr. Hecht became known for his verbal slips, once referring to the proposed nuclear waste repository that the federal government wants to open at Yucca Mountain as a ''nuclear suppository.'' Mr. Hecht served on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and was chairman of the Housing and Urban Affairs subcommittee. He also served on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence, which oversees intelligence-gathering activities of federal agencies. Born Mayer Jacob Hecht in Cape Girardeau, Mo., Mr. Hecht was known since childhood as Chic (pronounced chick), a nickname given him by an uncle. After graduation from Washington University in St. Louis in 1949, Mr. Hecht served as an Army counterintelligence agent in Berlin in 1952 and 1953. Soon afterward, Mr. Hecht moved to Nevada, where he became a prominent and wealthy businessman. He is survived by his wife, Gail, and two daughters, Lori and Leslie."

Kennedy Jr. saluting his father's coffin on Nov. 25, 1963, helped encapsulate a nation's grief, died Friday at a hospice near Annapolis, Md.","Stan Stearns, whose iconic photograph of John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his father's coffin on Nov. 25, 1963, helped encapsulate a nation's grief, died Friday at a hospice near Annapolis, Md. He was 76. The cause was lung cancer, said his son, Jay Stearns. The story of the famous image, captured while Mr. Stearns was on assignment for United Press International, is known virtually frame by frame to family and friends. Mr. Stearns made sure of that, said Gary Haynes, 76, another U.P.I. photographer working on the day of the president's funeral. ''I've heard several versions of it, which he tended to embellish at bars,'' Mr. Haynes said. Cordoned with a horde of photographers across from the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in Washington that day, Mr. Stearns trained his lens on Jacqueline Kennedy as the coffin neared. She bent toward John Jr. It was his third birthday. She whispered something. And, suddenly, the boy raised his right arm. ''The hand went up. Click -- one exposure,'' Mr. Stearns told The New York Times in 2007. ''That was it. That was the picture.'' Jay Stearns said his father's experience covering Mrs. Kennedy allowed him to size up the scene in a way that others could not. ''My father had an incredible ability to anticipate a moment,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''That photograph was a culmination of him knowing her.'' Stanley Frank Stearns was born in Annapolis on May 11, 1935, to William and Lillian Stearns, who owned a jewelry business. He spent four years with the Air Force as a photographer for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes, his son said, before joining U.P.I. in Washington near the end of the Eisenhower administration. He later covered the administrations of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon before moving into commercial photography in the 1970s. Besides his son, Jay, survivors include a brother, Allan. In 2007, Mr. Stearns's signature shot became the center of a controversy after the death of the photographer Joe O'Donnell, whose claim that he had taken the famous picture was repeated in remembrances nationwide. Mr. Stearns's colleagues swarmed to set the record straight. In e-mails to former U.P.I. colleagues in 2007, Mr. Stearns offered his own detailed retelling. After snapping the photograph, Mr. Stearns wrote, he ignored orders to go to Arlington National Cemetery and instead walked the film to the U.P.I bureau himself, convinced he had secured the day's indelible image. A photo manager in the office was furious, his face turning red, then white, Mr. Stearns said. ''You'd better have the picture of the funeral or you're fired!'' he recalled one boss yelling. The photo manager paced outside the door as Mr. Stearns processed the film himself -- a 17-minute task, he wrote. Finally, Mr. Stearns showed him the image. ''He does have the picture!'' the man shouted."

He was 88 years old. Mr. Burgin, whose death Wednesday in a nursing home marked the end of a concert violin career that spanned more than 75 years, came to the United States as Boston Symphony concertmaster in 1920. The Warsaw-born musician made his first public appearance at the age of 11, as a soloist with the Warsaw Philharmonic Society. He later studied in Leningrad and Stockholm, and began his American orchestral career under the French conductor Pierre Monteux. ''There is nothing like the Boston Symphony in Europe,'' he told an interviewer after coming to the United States. During his career, he led the Boston Symphony in 308 concerts in the United States, Australia and Japan, and was associate conductor at seven world premieres and 25 Boston premieres. Mr. Burgin usually conducted without a baton and, though he always had the score before him, he seldom looked down at it. ''In my youth, it was considered bad taste to perform from memory,'' he said. Within a year of coming to Boston, he organized the Burgin String Quartet. He headed the string department of the New England Conservatory at various times and joined the Boston University faculty in 1959. Mr. Burgin retired as Boston Symphony concertmaster at the end of the 1961-62 season and moved to Florida, where in the summer of 1965 he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra during its visit to Daytona Beach. Mr. Burgin last gave a concert in June 1980 at Florida State University. He leaves his wife, a son and a daughter. He will be buried in Gulfport, with memorial services later in Boston."

He was Police Chief of Manchester, N.H., when he was elected the legion's national commander in August 1947. He had previously been a newspaperman in Manchester, working as a reporter and editor first on the old Daily Mirror and then The Union Leader. As national commander in 1947-48, Mr. O'Neil headed the legion during the mounting Cold War and an intensification of anti-Communist sentiments in the United States. On the day of his election, he cautioned that ''we must always be on the alert against Communism'' and said that it should be eliminated in the United States. But he added that this should be done ''by means of education and not by witch hunts.'' Formed Counter-Subversive Group A few months later, he announced the formation of a group of selected legion members who would be able to ''spot and counter'' subversive activities that he said were part of the Communist Party's program for ''undermining our democratic way of life.''

Mr. Costello held his high posts at Grace, a specialty chemicals and health care company, from 1995 through 1998, and then retired. Its headquarters were in Boca Raton, Fla., during that period and are now in Columbia, Md. By May 1996, Grace's stock had risen over 40 percent. Late in his tenure as chairman, in 1998, Grace had annual sales of about $1.5 billion. In August 1997, Grace said it would divest itself of its packaging business. The deal essentially involved a purchase of Grace's Cryovac packaging business by another large packaging company, the Sealed Air Corporation, in a transaction valued at $5 billion. The Grace name was to be retained by the specialty chemicals business. In October 1997, Mr. Costello had a heart attack, and Larry Ellberger was named to act as chief executive during his recovery.

He was 58. The cause was gastric cancer, his family said. His dramatic modern houses, million-dollar hideaways in the forests of northern Westchester, seemed to echo the Byzantine and Greek forms of Macedonia as enshrined in its monasteries, temples and minareted mosques. Acting as both designer and contractor, he pursued an independent career of some 30 years, along with his wife, Stefanie. The couple operated as Pound Ridge Contemporaries, and a retrospective of his work was seen just last month at the Hiram Halle Memorial Library in Pound Ridge. On view were conceptual drawings, floor plans, models and color photographs of the completed structures. Altogether, he had 57 houses to his credit, 28 of them in Pound Ridge alone. Mr. Tashkovich personally supervised the realization of his designs at the construction site. Typically, his creations were spacious white structures tucked away on two- or four-acre grounds by a lakeside, bathed in light and with sweeping views. Vuko Tashkovich was born in Skopje, the capital of the Macedonian republic, which was part of the former Yugoslavia. He came to the United States at the age of 20 and graduated from the School of Architecture at Cornell University. Before striking out on his own, he worked for the architects Eliot Noyes, John M. Johansen and I. M. Pei & Partners. He then became a latter-day master builder, integrating design and construction in his profession. To that end, he explored the rich architectural past of Byzantium and Greece to discover geometric forms with which to capture light, one of his prime concerns. Besides his wife and partner, Stefanie Lipsit Tashkovich, he is survived by two sons, Gligor and Mark, both of Pound Ridge; his stepmother, Virginia Harlow Tashkovich of Manhattan; his brother Oto, a resident of New Zealand, and a half-brother, Ljubo Tashkovich of Monaco."

He was 85 years old and lived in Philadelphia. Hospital officials said he died of heart failure. Dr. Gaster was the chairman of the religion department at Barnard College from 1968 to 1972 and taught there and at Columbia University, Fairleigh Dickinson University, the University of Florida in Gainesville and at Dropsie College in Philadelphia during an academic career that spanned five decades. Like Joseph Campbell, Dr. Gaster sought to recover the myths and fables of the early Hittites, Canaanites, Hebrews, Greeks and Romans. His major goal was to understand the stories in the context of the time they were created, said one of his former students, Joseph R. Armenti. ""Both he and Campbell tried to bring the myth to life,"" said Dr. Armenti, who received his Ph.D. under Dr. Gaster and now practices law in Philadelphia. ""Campbell saw it as a story in which the modern-day reader might gain some insight, but Gaster saw it as a testament to a different mindset. He questioned whether it was possible to transform it to today. 'That world is gone,' he used to say."" Worked on Dead Sea Scrolls Dr. Gaster worked with the original team of translators of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were discovered in the late 1940's. His book ""Dead Sea Scriptures"" sold over 200,000 copies. Among his other popular works were ""Oldest Stories in the World,"" ""The New Golden Bough,"" ""Thespis,"" ""Myth, Legend and Custom in the Old Testament"" and ""The Holy and the Profane: Evolution of Jewish Folkways."" When he was born in London in 1906, his father, Moses Gaster, the Chief Rabbi of the Sephardic Jews, named him after his friend, Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism. When he was a youth, his father went blind, and the boy was responsible for reading books out loud to keep his father abreast of scholarship. Dr. Gaster later said this experienced heightened his interest in language, scholarship and mythology. He studied Greek, Latin and archeology at the University of London and received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1943. He was said to be literate in 29 languages and dialects. When he turned to teaching, many students found him intimidating; he was quick to challenge the truth of the stories that many of his students had learned in church or synagogue. And he was famous for yelling ""Go away!"" in a raspy voice when a student timidly knocked on his office door. His manner often did not sit well with academic committees, many of which rejected his applications for tenure. 'Old-Fashioned Scholar' But students and colleagues who managed to get close to him said Dr. Gaster was generous with his time and knowledge. ""He was an old-fashioned scholar,"" said David Marcus, associate professor of Bible at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan. ""He was able to amass cross-cultural parallels on whatever he was working on, and he had the linguistic training to look at the sources. He would spend hours in the library digging up arcane facts."" Dr. Gaster received two Guggenheim Fellowships and two Fullbright Professorships, one in Rome and the other in Melbourne, Australia. He also served as the chief of the Hebraic section of the Library of Congress from 1944 to 1948. In 1959 and in 1963, he was the Annual Guest Professor of Semitic Studies at the University of Leeds in England. He was also visiting professor of religion at Yale from 1972 to 1974, and of Judaic studies at City College of New York from 1974 to 1975.

26986,"Wendell Chino, 74, President Of New Mexico Tribe, Is Dead","Wendell Chino, the longtime president of the Mescalero Apache Nation who helped to lift his tribe from tar-paper shack poverty with his persuasive style of ""red capitalism,"" died on Wednesday at the Santa Monica-U.C.L.A.","Wendell Chino, the longtime president of the Mescalero Apache Nation who helped to lift his tribe from tar-paper shack poverty with his persuasive style of ""red capitalism,"" died on Wednesday at the Santa Monica-U.C.L.A. Medical Center in California. He was 74. Mr. Chino had suffered from a heart ailment and collapsed while walking on a treadmill at a health clinic in Santa Monica, said Catherine Bedell, a spokeswoman for the Mescalero Apache tribe of New Mexico. Mr. Chino was revived but later died of a second heart attack, she said. After more than a century of Federal policies that ranged from extermination to assimilation, Indian nations began in the 1960's to gain a greater degree of self-determination. The movement began in earnest with men like Mr. Chino, the president of his tribe for 34 years, who demanded that the Federal Government honor the treaties it made with Indian nations regarding the use of the land and its resources. ""He took stances that affected Indians not only on his reservation, but all over the country,"" said Roy Bernal, chairman of the All Indian Pueblo Council and a member of the Taos Pueblo nation. ""In the scheme of the 20th century, it has been said that Wendell Chino was a Martin Luther King or a Malcolm X of Indian Country,"" Mr. Bernal said. ""He was truly a modern warrior."" Until the mid-1960's, the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs had significant control over the Mescalero reservation, 200 miles south of Albuquerque. The agency oversaw everything from mining to lumber to grazing contracts on the reservation, which is home to 4,000 people. As those contracts expired, Mr. Chino did not renew them, instead creating lumber and cattle companies controlled by the impoverished tribe. With Mr. Chino's guidance, the Mescalero Apache Nation built a ski resort, the Inn of the Mountain Gods, Casino Apache, a timber mill and a metal fabrication plant, as well as Indian schools, a hospital and a health center. In 1977, during a court battle in which Mr. Chino was attempting to secure sole control of Mescalero Apache natural resources, he described the problem: ""The white man has raped this land and now he wastes the six million acres of Indian land in this state."" Mr. Chino believed Indian people should make decisions about Indian land, a notion he described as ""red capitalism."" Mr. Chino's positions could also be unpopular: he split with New Mexico Indian leaders last year, refusing to honor a gambling revenue-sharing agreement with the state. ""He did not recognize the state as a legitimate entity,"" Mr. Bernal said. ""He would only deal with the Federal government, nation to nation."" Mr. Chino also created a split within the Mescalero community when he invited nuclear power companies to bury their radioactive waste on tribal land in the early 1990's. The tribe rejected the proposal. ""His friends were few,"" said James Toulouse, an Albuquerque lawyer who considers himself part of that small circle. ""But folks listened to what he had to say."" Even Presidents did not escape Mr. Chino's wrath. He lambasted President Jimmy Carter in 1978 for what Mr. Chino called the President's lack of attention to the economic and political problems of the American Indian. ""If Jimmy Carter has time enough to worry about human rights in Latin America and poverty in Africa, he should find some time to visit American Indians,"" Mr. Chino said. Mr. Chino, described at times as a benevolent dictator, held tightly to the reins of Mescalero affairs while he traveled the world as a spokesman for Indian issues and served as the president of the National Congress of American Indians. Born on Dec. 25, 1923, on the reservation, Mr. Chino was educated in the Santa Fe Indian School System. He attended Central College in Pella, Iowa, and the Cook Christian Training School in Phoenix. He was an ordained minister in the Dutch Reformed Church and a graduate of Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Mich. He is survived by his wife, Rita, and son, Mark, both of Mescalero."

The formation of the Swatch Group, which in addition to Swatch today comprises high-end watch brands like Breguet, Omega, Longines, Tissot, Calvin Klein and Mido, made Mr. Hayek one of Switzerland's wealthiest men. The exquisite irony is that the company came about after Mr. Hayek was brought in to help shut the foundering Swiss watch industry altogether. A flamboyant figure with a roguish sense of humor, Mr. Hayek was ''a rare phenomenon in Europe -- a genuine business celebrity,'' as The Harvard Business Review described him in 1993. Nicolas Hayek was born in Beirut in 1928 and moved to Switzerland as a young man. After studying mathematics, physics and chemistry at the University of Lyon in France, he started a consulting firm, Hayek Engineering, in Zurich in the early 1960s. By the 1970s, the vaunted Swiss watch industry, a pillar of the national economy for centuries, was in jeopardy. Japanese watchmakers like Seiko had begun to undercut Swiss prices. And public tastes were shifting from the finely wrought analog timepieces in which Swiss artisans had long specialized to the pale flickering faces of mass-market digital watches. In the early 1980s, with no apparent remedy in sight, a group of Swiss banks asked Mr. Hayek to compile a report on how the watchmaking industry might best be liquidated. Instead, he merged two of its former titans, Asuag and SSIH, which between them owned brands like Omega, Longines and Tissot. Mr. Hayek bought a majority stake in the reorganized group, known as SMH -- the Societe Suisse de Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie. (He was fond of telling interviewers that the initials stood for ''Sa Majeste Hayek'' -- ''His Royal Highness Hayek.'') In 1983, SMH introduced the Swatch. Lightweight, with vibrantly colored bands and breezy novelty faces, it was remarkably inexpensive to produce. (It had 51 parts, as opposed to the nearly 100 needed to make a traditional wristwatch.) It retailed for less than $35 when it was first marketed in the United States later that year. The Swatch quickly became a sought-after collector's item worldwide. It was very likely the first time that ordinary people had even considered owning multiple watches. (Mr. Hayek himself was known to appear in public wearing as many as eight -- four to an arm -- though at least a few of these were from his luxury brands.) Several hundred million Swatches have been sold since the brand's inception. The success of the Swatch also resuscitated the high-end brands under the SMH umbrella. The company, whose name was changed to the Swatch Group in the 1990s, generated about $4.9 billion in sales last year, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. By redirecting consumers' attention to Swiss watchmaking as a whole, the little plastic watch lifted all boats. Even the expensive brands, like Breguet, ''we will continue to sell -- and sell well,'' Mr. Hayek told the publication Swiss News in 2008. He added, ''We sell the mentality of Switzerland.'' Mr. Hayek stepped down as the Swatch Group's chief executive in 2002 and was succeeded by his son, Nicolas Jr. His daughter Nayla sits on the company's board. Information about other survivors could not be confirmed. Over time, the humble Swatch itself was borne upward by its own success: the company has issued limited-edition Swatches designed by noted artists like Keith Haring. In 1992, The New York Times reported, a Swatch by Kiki Picasso, a pseudonym of the French artist Christian Chapiron, sold at auction at Christie's in London for $28,000."

W. de Basil's Ballets Russes in the 1940's and a star of one of that troupe's most controversial productions, died on Sept. 23 at his home in New Hope, Pa. He was 79. The cause was cancer, said his son, Matthew. A native of Chicago, where he received his early training, Mr. MacKenzie was a member of the Ballets Russes from 1940 to 1947. An attractive and muscular dancer, he created a sensation in 1946 as Cain in David Lichine's ""Cain and Abel,"" with Oleg Tupine as Abel. The ballet raised eyebrows because the choreography required the men to wrestle in skimpy trunks and to dance erotically with flimsily clad women symbolizing Good and Evil. Another unusual role Mr. MacKenzie danced with the Ballets Russes in 1946 was the Sun God in Vania Psota's ""Yara,"" a retelling of Brazilian folklore with Surrealist scenery by the painter Candido Portinari. After the Ballets Russes, Mr. MacKenzie appeared in summer theaters and in a City Center revival of ""Carousel"" in 1949. Then, having injured his Achilles' tendon, he worked on a pipeline and in a General Motors factory in Ewing, N.J. He bought property in New Hope during the 50's and opened a coffeehouse there. Shortly after his wife, Mildred Ferguson, a former Ballet Theater dancer, died in 1981, he was reintroduced to Nina Stroganova, a Danish-born ballerina he had known from the Ballets Russes. They remained companions until her death in 1994. In addition to his son, of New Hope, he is survived by a daughter, Holly Hrynczyszyn of Buckingham, Pa. http://www.nytimes.com"

51090,"John Demjanjuk, Accused of Atrocities As a Nazi Camp Guard, Is Dead at 91",The stranger settled in Cleveland after World War II with his wife and little girl. He became an autoworker and changed his first name from Ivan to John.,"The stranger settled in Cleveland after World War II with his wife and little girl. He became an autoworker and changed his first name from Ivan to John. He had two more children, became a naturalized American, lived quietly and retired. His war and the terrors of concentration camps were all but forgotten. Decades later, the past came back to haunt John Demjanjuk. And for the rest of his life it hovered over a tortuous odyssey of denunciations by Nazi hunters and Holocaust survivors, of questions over his identity, citizenship revocations, deportation orders and eventually trials in Israel and Germany for war crimes. He was convicted and reprieved in Israel and, steadfastly denying the accusations, was appealing a guilty verdict in Germany when he died on Saturday at a nursing home in southern Germany, his son, John Demjanjuk Jr., said. He was 91. Even at the end of his life questions remained in a case that had always been riddled with mysteries. Had he been, as he and his family claimed, a Ukrainian prisoner of war in Germany and Poland who made his way to America and became a victim of mistaken identity? Or had he been, as prosecutors charged, a collaborating guard who willingly participated in the killing of Jews at the Treblinka, Majdanek and Sobibor death camps? Nazi hunters and protesters who had demonstrated outside his home for years had no doubts. Nor did the Justice Department. Mr. Demjanjuk, stripped of his citizenship in 1981, was deported to Israel, where witnesses and an identity card of ''Ivan the Terrible,'' a sadist who had murdered thousands of Jews at Treblinka, had turned up. The photograph on the card bore a striking resemblance to Mr. Demjanjuk. He was placed on trial, convicted in 1988 of crimes against humanity and sentenced to be hanged. But five years later, the Israeli Supreme Court overturned the conviction when new evidence showed that another Ukrainian was probably the notorious Ivan. Back in America, Mr. Demjanjuk regained his citizenship, only to have it revoked again as new allegations arose. Deported to Germany in 2009, Mr. Demjanjuk, suffering from bone-marrow and kidney diseases, was tried in a Munich court on charges in the killing of 27,900 Jews at the Sobibor camp in German-occupied Poland in 1943. In the nearly seven decades since 250,000 people were put to death at Sobibor, no surviving witnesses, even those who had been shown photographs, could place him at the scene. The case was largely based on documentary evidence -- an S.S. identity card purporting to be Mr. Demjanjuk's, Nazi orders sending the man identified as Mr. Demjanjuk to work as a guard at Sobibor and other records of the era -- and testimony by relatives of victims killed in the camp. In May 2011, the Munich court found Mr. Demjanjuk guilty and sentenced him to five years in prison. He was credited with two years of pretrial detention, leaving three left to serve if an appeal failed. Pending the appeal, he was released from prison and transferred to a nursing home. The court said his age, infirmity and statelessness made it unlikely he would flee. Even some relatives of the victims, who were recognized as co-complainants at the trial, said it was the proof of guilt, finally, that counted. ''Whether it's three, four or five years doesn't really matter,'' said David van Huiden, who lost his mother, father and sister at Sobibor. ''He took part. He volunteered.'' Mr. Demjanjuk's son, however, said that under German law, a conviction is not official until appeals are completed, and that his father's death had the effect of ''voiding'' the Munich verdict. Mr. Demjanjuk died a ''a victim and a survivor of Soviet and German brutality,'' his son said, adding, ''History will show Germany used him as a scapegoat to blame helpless Ukrainian P.O.W.'s for the deeds of Nazi Germans.'' Ivan Demjanjuk (pronounced (dem-YAHN-yook) was born on April 3, 1920, in Dubovye Makharintsy, a village in Ukraine, to impoverished, disabled parents. The family nearly starved in a forced famine in the early 1930s that left millions dead in Ukraine. He had only four years of schooling, and was drafted into the Soviet Army in 1941. In 1942, the Germans wounded and captured him in the Crimea. What he did for the rest of the war was the crux of the issues surrounding his later life. After the war, Mr. Demjanjuk met Vera Bulochnik in a German camp for displaced persons. They married and in 1950, still living in camps, had a daughter, Lydia. In 1952, they emigrated to the United States and settled in Cleveland. Mr. Demjanjuk became a mechanic at a Ford plant and she worked in a factory. The couple had two more children, John Jr. and Irene. In 1958, Mr. Demjanjuk was naturalized. In 1973, the family moved to the Cleveland suburb of Seven Hills. Besides his son, Mr. Demjanjuk is survived by his wife; his two daughters, Lydia Maday and Irene Nishnic; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. In 1977, the Justice Department sued to revoke Mr. Demjanjuk's citizenship, saying he had lied on his immigration application to hide mass murders and other war crimes at Treblinka, the camp in Poland where 870,000 died. The accusations arose from Holocaust survivors who had identified Mr. Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible, a Ukrainian captured and trained by the Germans to operate gas chambers. In 1981, after years of delays, a federal judge ruled that Mr. Demjanjuk had lied on his immigration papers and revoked his citizenship. He appealed, and the case was pending when Israel extradited him to stand trial as Ivan the Terrible. He was deported to Israel in 1986, and the trial began in 1987. Prosecutors produced a Nazi identity card, said to be from the S.S. training camp at Trawniki, Poland, that bore what looked like Mr. Demjanjuk's photograph. It cited his name and date of birth, his father's name, and a scar like one Mr. Demjanjuk had. Prosecutors said he had volunteered to collaborate and had been trained at Trawniki to run diesel engines that supplied carbon monoxide for gas chambers. They said he had killed thousands at Treblinka in 1942 and 1943. Treblinka survivors testified that Ivan the Terrible had also savaged Jews, breaking arms and legs with a steel pipe, cutting off ears and noses with a sword, and flogging women and children with sadistic glee. But the defense noted that the survivors were relying on memories four decades old. It also challenged the identity card, saying the photo showed signs of having been lifted from another document, cited an incorrect height for Mr. Demjanjuk, and said its bearer had been at camps in Poland at Chelmno in 1942 and Sobibor in 1943 but did not mention Treblinka. Mr. Demjanjuk testified that he had been held as a prisoner at Chelmno for 18 months until 1944, and then in Austria until the war's end. Found guilty and sentenced to death in 1988, he was held until 1993, when the Israeli Supreme Court struck down his conviction, citing new evidence from former guards at Treblinka that Ivan the Terrible was another Ukrainian, Ivan Marchenko. On his citizenship application, Mr. Demjanjuk had listed his mother's maiden name as Marchenko, but contended later that he had forgotten her real maiden name and used Marchenko only because it was common in Ukraine. Released by Israel, Mr. Demjanjuk returned to Cleveland, where a federal appeals court overturned his 1981 conviction for lying on his immigration papers, saying prosecutors had deliberately withheld evidence and committed fraud. His citizenship was restored in 1998. But in 1999, the government again sued to strip him of citizenship, charging that he had been a Nazi guard at Majdanek and Sobibor in Poland and at Flossenburg in Bavaria. After a trial, a court in 2002 upheld the government. An appeal confirmed the decision in 2004. In 2005, he was ordered deported to Germany, Poland or Ukraine, and the United States Supreme Court denied him a hearing in 2008. In 2009, Germany agreed to accept Mr. Demjanjuk as a deportee to stand trial on charges that he helped kill Jews at Sobibor. His lawyers and family argued that he was too sick, but doctors concluded that he was fit enough. The case involved 15 transport trains known to have arrived at Sobibor in 1943 from the Westerbork camp in the Netherlands, carrying 29,579 people. Mr. Demjanjuk was charged with 27,900 counts based on a theory that some must have died in transit. ''When a transport of Jews arrived, routine work was suspended and all camp personnel took part in the routine process of extermination,'' the indictment said. The unloading of the trains proceeded ''with loud cries, blows and also shots. If people refused to come out, the Trawnikis entered the cars and forced those who hesitated, with violence, out of the train and onto the ramp.'' In painful detail, witnesses like Rudie S. Cortissos recited dates when the trains arrived, the number of people aboard and the names of prisoners. Mr. Cortissos said his mother arrived on May 21, 1943, with 2,300 others, mostly Dutch Jews who were immediately sent to the gas chambers. Defense lawyers argued that the Soviets had falsified Mr. Demjanjuk's identity card and other documents, but a judge found a clear trail of evidence showing his path from Soviet prisoner to Sobibor guard. The court rejected arguments that he had no choice but to work in the camp, and concluded that it would have been impossible for a guard there not to have been part of the Nazi death machinery. Evidence at the trial also filled in previously unknown details of Mr. Demjanjuk's life between Sobibor and the end of the war. It showed that after Sobibor was shut down in 1943, Mr. Demjanjuk served in a Ukrainian unit that fought alongside the Germans, was captured by American forces in 1945 and was sent to the displaced persons camp where he met and married the woman who was to share his odyssey. The Munich case might well have been the last major war crimes trial in Germany, ending an era that began in Nuremberg in 1945. As survivors and defendants have aged and died, the prosecution of Nazi-era war criminals has become increasingly rare and difficult. And the elusiveness lies not only in the distance of the past, as Justice Meir Shamgar of the Israeli Supreme Court said in striking down Mr. Demjanjuk's conviction. ''This was the proper course for judges who cannot examine the heart and the mind, but have only what their eyes see and read,'' he wrote. ''The matter is closed -- but not complete. The complete truth is not the prerogative of the human judge.''"

Bachman, an engineer who created software to harness business data in the early 1960s, laying a technical foundation for modern digital commerce, died on Thursday at his home in Lexington, Mass.","Charles W. Bachman, an engineer who created software to harness business data in the early 1960s, laying a technical foundation for modern digital commerce, died on Thursday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 92. His daughter Chandini Bachman confirmed his death. Mr. Bachman was a pioneer in the field of database management software. His work would later be eclipsed by that of other innovators, and software tools have changed drastically over the years. But behind every product search on Amazon, movie recommendation on Netflix or bid on eBay, there is a flood of digital communications mediated by database management software, which owes an intellectual debt to Mr. Bachman. He was working for General Electric when he developed a layer of software that allowed programmers to retrieve data for an automated manufacturing system that controlled a variety of tasks -- production scheduling, parts ordering and inventory management. His Integrated Data Store software, first demonstrated in 1963, made it possible to share data across different applications. That capability had been talked about before, but Mr. Bachman was the first to carry it out. His software was crucial to converting the G.E. manufacturing-control system from an idea to a reality, an impressive technical feat given the limitations of the primitive computers at the time. In 1973, Mr. Bachman received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery for his contributions to database technology. The award is often described as the Nobel Prize for computer science. In 2014, Mr. Bachman visited the White House to receive a National Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Barack Obama. Mr. Bachman was the first Turing Award recipient who did not have a Ph.D. The earlier winners of the prize, which was first issued in 1966, had academic backgrounds, mainly as mathematicians or physicists. Mr. Bachman had degrees in mechanical engineering, a bachelor's from Michigan State College and a master's from the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Bachman spent his career in the business world at a series of companies large and small, including Dow Chemical, G.E., Honeywell and a start-up backed by venture capital in the 1980s. Yet it was the application of computing to business problems -- rather than business itself -- that Mr. Bachman found appealing. ''He was always an engineer at heart,'' said Thomas Haigh, a technology historian at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who interviewed Mr. Bachman for an oral history project and studied his work. ''He was motivated by the joy of tinkering with complex systems and making things work better.'' Charles William Bachman III was born on Dec. 11, 1924, in Manhattan, Kan., the second of four children of Grace Marie Cary Bachman and Charles W. Bachman Jr. His father was the football coach at Kansas State College, and later at Michigan State. The younger Mr. Bachman grew to be a sturdy 6 feet 4 inches, and he inherited his father's fondness for sports, but his real passion was building and fixing things. ''I was always going to be an engineer,'' Mr. Bachman told Mr. Haigh in 2004. Mr. Bachman graduated early from high school, took spring and summer courses at Michigan State and then joined the Army in 1943, serving two years in the artillery corps in New Guinea, Australia and the Philippines. Antiaircraft guns at the time used simple mechanical computers to target a plane's predicted flight path, a rudimentary primer for Mr. Bachman's later work. After the war, Mr. Bachman returned to Michigan State to complete his undergraduate degree in 1948. The following year, he married Constance Hadley, shortly after she graduated from Michigan State. They were married for 62 years. She died in 2012. Besides his daughter Chandini, Mr. Bachman is survived by a brother, J. Cary; three other children, Thomas, Jonathan and Sara Bachman Ducey; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter. Mr. Bachman began his engineering career with big companies that were starting to use computers -- Dow Chemical, G.E. and Honeywell, which bought G.E.'s computer business in 1970. During that time, Mr. Bachman took a leading role in computing organizations, which were establishing standards for how data is represented, shared and modeled. Later in his career, Mr. Bachman worked for smaller companies and started one of his own, Bachman Information Systems, in 1983. The start-up focused on a technology called computer-aided software engineering. It was intended to make creating software easier by offering programmers graphical tools instead of requiring them to write code line by line. His company attracted funding from two leading venture capital firms, Venrock and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and it enjoyed some early success. It sold shares in a public offering in 1991, and its stock price surged for a while. The young company had some impressive technology. But it failed to catch the shift to personal computers running Microsoft's Windows software and lower-cost applications programs. The remnants of Bachman Information Systems went through a couple of mergers and eventually sold to a larger corporation. ''Charlie was always the architect, not a managerial C.E.O. type,'' said Jonathan Bachman, a software project manager who worked with his father for years. ''And a lot of what he designed lives on, in a new guise, today.''"
2626,"Pu Jie, 87, Dies, Ending Dynasty Of the Manchus","Pu Jie, the younger brother of the last Emperor of China, died on Monday in Beijing.","BEIJING, March 1 Pu Jie, the younger brother of the last Emperor of China, died on Monday in Beijing. He was 87. The official New China News Agency, announcing the death in a two-paragraph report, said only that he had succumbed to illness. An official at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory group, said the main cause was prostate cancer. Mr. Pu spent his early years behind the crimson walls of the Forbidden City with his elder brother, Pu Yi, who was 7 when he was deposed in the 1911 revolution that toppled the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty. In the 1930's the brothers collaborated with Japanese invaders and were later jailed as war criminals by the Chinese Communists. After nearly 15 years in prison, Pu Jie was released in 1960 and spent his final years in retirement in his family's old 16-room house in Beijing, where he practiced calligraphy, worked in his garden and cared for his cats. He met occasionally with reporters to reminisce about his aristocratic past, express fervent gratitude to the Communists and pronounce himself pleased with his new life. Just a Drop in the Ocean During an interview in 1981, he walked through the palaces of the Forbidden City and described what life was once like there. ""Those days were like a dream, but now I am happy,"" he said. ""In the past I was a drop of foul water,"" said Mr. Pu, who was drilled in repentance during his years in prison. ""Now I am submerged in the ocean of a billion people. Before, I cared only about myself and the restoration of the Qing dynasty. Now my goal is to do what I can for the people."" Even after the end of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Pu Jie and his brother, who was a year older, continued to live in isolated splendor in the imperial palace, a story told in the Chinese-Italian film ""The Last Emperor."" After Japanese invaders set up the puppet government of Manchukuo in 1932 in northeastern China, they made Pu Yi a figurehead ruler. Pu Jie was trained in Japan and became his brother's aide-de-camp. The Japanese arranged a marriage for Pu Jie with a cousin of Emperor Hirohito, Princess Hito Saga, and changed the rules of succession to permit him to follow his brother, who had no children. If Japan had won the war, Pu Jie could have become Emperor of China. But the brothers were captured by Soviet forces in 1945 when Japan surrendered and were imprisoned in the Soviet Union. They were handed over to China in 1950, the year after the Communists came to power there. Instead of executing the last Manchu aristocrats, the Chinese Communists jailed them for nearly another decade while they were taught to view themselves as common citizens so they could be used for propaganda. Pu Yi died of cancer in 1967. After his release from prison, Pu Jie spent a year gardening in a park in Beijing. Then Prime Minister Zhou Enlai granted his request to do historical research on the Manchus, who ruled China from 1644 to 1911. Mr. Pu always maintained that his ideological conversion in prison was voluntary. ""I always tell people, 'If a horse does not want to drink water, it won't help to push his head down into the water,' "" he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1984. Pu Jie's wife died in 1987. Their elder daughter died in Japan in 1957. Mr. Pu is survived by a second daughter, who is married and lives in Japan, and five grandchildren."
22124,"Von Freeman, Fiery Tenor Saxophonist, Dies at 88","Von Freeman, who was considered one of the finest tenor saxophonists in jazz but attained wide fame only late in life, died on Aug. 11 in Chicago.","Von Freeman, who was considered one of the finest tenor saxophonists in jazz but attained wide fame only late in life, died on Aug. 11 in Chicago. He was 88.The cause was heart failure, his son Mark said. Though his work won him ardent admirers, Mr. Freeman, familiarly known as Vonski, was for decades largely unknown outside Chicago, where he was born and reared and spent most of his life. As The Chicago Tribune wrote in 1998, his playing ''represents a standard by which other tenor saxophonists must be judged.'' Last year, Mr. Freeman was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, the nation's highest honor in the field. Not until the 1980s did he begin performing more often on famous out-of-town stages, including Alice Tully Hall and the Village Vanguard in New York. Earlier in his career Mr. Freeman had made much of his living, as he told The Tribune, playing for ''strip joints, taxi dances, vaudeville shows, comedians, jugglers, weddings, bar mitzvahs, jazz clubs, dives, Polish dances, Jewish dances, every nationality.'' If he never got his big break as a young player, Mr. Freeman said, then that was because he never especially sought one. ''I'm not trying to brag or nothing, but I always knew I could play, 50, 60 years ago,'' he told The Tribune in 2002. ''I really don't play any different than the way I played then. And I never let it worry me that I didn't get anywhere famewise, or I didn't make hit records.'' What he preferred to chasing fame, he said, was playing jazz as he felt it demanded to be played. The result, critics agreed, was music -- often dazzling, occasionally bewildering -- that sounded like no one else's. Mr. Freeman's playing was characterized by emotional fire (he was so intense he once bit his mouthpiece clean off); a huge sound (this, he said, took root in strip clubs where the band played from behind a curtain); and singular musical ideas. His work had a daring elasticity, with deliberately off-kilter phrasing that made it sound like speech. He cherished roughness and imperfection, although, as critics observed, he could play a ballad with the best of them. Where some listeners faulted him for playing out of tune, others praised him for exploiting a chromatic range far greater than the paltry 12 notes the Western musical scale offers. ''Don't tune up too much, baby,'' Mr. Freeman once told a colleague. ''You'll lose your soul.'' His masterly tonal control let him summon unlovely sounds whenever he chose to, and he chose to often. His timbre has been called wheezing, honking, rasping and, in the"

Pappas, a prominent Republican who was Ambassador to Greece during the Eisenhower Administration, died at his home here after a long illness. He was 89 years old. Mr. Pappas, who was a native of Greece, was a friend to Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. In 1974, he was called to testify before the Senate Watergate Committee about his suspected role in raising money to help several of the original Watergate defendants. According to published reports, Mr. Pappas was mentioned in taped White House conversations. He denied any part in the affair. At the 1968 Republican national convention in Miami, Mr. Pappas played a role in the selection of Mr. Agnew as Mr. Nixon's running mate. He also served on a number of regional, state and national Republican committees. Mr. Pappas and his brother, John, turned their father's small Greek grocery in Boston into a liquor and food import distributorship. They branched out to found Esso Pappas, an industrial complex in Greece."
11061,"BILL BRANDT, 79, PHOTOGRAPHER OF FOREBODING IMAGES, DEAD","Bill Brandt, a British photographer known for his eloquently foreboding vision, died yesterday in London.","Bill Brandt, a British photographer known for his eloquently foreboding vision, died yesterday in London. He was 79 years old. A major figure in modern British photography, Mr. Brandt was known for pictures of British social life, landscapes, portraits and stylized female nudes. His work defied the crisp classical photography style in favor of atmospheric, sometimes cryptic images. ''Bill Brandt was the great English photographer of this century,'' said John Szarkowski, director of the department of photography at the Museum of Modern Art. Mr. Brandt was born in South London, but spent much of his youth in Germany and Switzerland, where he recovered from tuberculosis. He suffered from ill health for much of his life, and was a diabetic. Mr. Brandt began studying photography in Switzerland, and in 1929 he spent three months in Paris as studio assistant to the surrealist photographer Man Ray. While in Paris, he was also strongly influenced by the films of Luis Bunuel and by the photographs of Brassa""i and Eug ene Atget. In 1931, Mr. Brandt returned to London and began photographing British social life, documenting all levels of British life with candid photographs taken at coal mines, pubs, clubs, race tracks and drawing rooms. He usually worked on assignment as a photojournalist throughout his career, at first for British and French newspapers and magazines and later for American publications, including The New York Times Magazine. Mr. Brandt's early photographs were collected in two books, ''The English at Home'' in 1936 and ''A Night in London'' in 1938. Diane Arbus was among the photographers whocited the influence of Mr. Brandt's images. During World War II, Mr. Brandt photographed a blacked-out, desolate London after the German attack, work that appeared in his 1948 book ''Camera in London'' along with images of peacetime. After the war, however, he turned to photographing artists' portraits, landscapes and female nudes. In The New York Times in 1969, Hilton Kramer said Mr. Brandt's portraits of the writers Robert Graves and Dylan Thomas and the painter Francis Bacon, among others, ''show us figures and faces almost unbearably vulnerable.'' Novels Influenced Landscapes Mr. Brandt's pictures of moody British landscapes, their sites suggested by places in the novels of Dickens, Hardy and others, were collected in ''Literary Britain,'' published in England in 1951. In 1975, he selected and arranged photographs for ''The Land: Twentieth Century Landscape Photographs,'' also published in Britain. Some of Mr. Brandt's most influential photographs were those of female nudes. Using an old, fixed-focus studio camera with a wide-angle lens, he created distorted images that were at times nearly unrecognizable as human forms. He began making those photographs in the 1940's, but did not publish them until 1961, when his ''Perspective of Nudes'' appeared. In 1977, he began a second series of nudes, many of them in nightmarish poses; they appeared along with some earlier photographs in his 1980 book ''Nudes 1945-1980.'' Mr. Brandt's first one-man show in the United States was at Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y., in 1963. Three years later, he published a retrospective book, ''Shadow of Light,'' which he revised and expanded for its 1977 edition. In 1969, the Museum of Modern Art mounted a major retrospective of his photographs, and since then they have been shown at the Marlborough Gallery and the International Center of Photography, as well as at museums and galleries around the United States. In 1981, the Royal Photographic Society in England inaugurated its National Center of Photography with a 50-year retrospective of Mr. Brandt's work."
20146,"Rosa Guy, 89, Author of Forthright Novels for Young People","Rosa Guy, a Caribbean-born writer known for her unflinchingly direct novels for young people about black life in urban America, died on Sunday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.","Rosa Guy, a Caribbean-born writer known for her unflinchingly direct novels for young people about black life in urban America, died on Sunday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 89. The cause was cancer, her grandson Warner Guy III said. Ms. Guy (her surname rhymes with ''key'') was widely considered one of the 20th century's most distinguished writers for young adults. She addressed subjects that had remained largely unexplored in fiction for teenagers when she began her career four decades ago. The themes to which she returned repeatedly in these books -- and in several well-received novels for adults -- included race, class, poverty, sexuality and simmering tensions between American blacks and Afro-Caribbean immigrants newly arrived in the United States. ''She's never afraid of the truth,'' the writer Maya Angelou, a friend of more than 50 years, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ''Some writers dress the truth in a kind of elegant language, so it doesn't seem quite so blatant, so harsh, so raw. But Rosa was not afraid of that.'' Of her books for young adults, the best known was a trilogy of novels, ''The Friends'' (1973), ''Ruby'' (1976) and ''Edith Jackson'' (1978). The books drew partly on Ms. Guy's experience as a young immigrant from Trinidad, coming of age in New York without money, parents or stability. ''The Friends'' centers on the sometimes wary alliance between two teenage schoolmates: Phyllisia Cathy, an educated West Indian immigrant, and Edith Jackson, a poor, street-smart African-American born and reared in Harlem. The second book in the trilogy features Phyllisia's sister, Ruby, who embarks on a lesbian relationship with another girl -- a taboo subject in children's literature then. The third returns to Edith, now in a foster home and pregnant, who must choose between having the baby and having an abortion. Reviewing ''The Friends'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1973, the novelist Alice Walker described it as a ''heart-slammer,'' adding: ''This book is called a 'juvenile.' So be a juvenile while you read it. Rosa Guy will give you back a large part of the memory of those years that you've been missing.'' Ms. Guy's novels for adults include ''My Love, My Love: Or, The Peasant Girl'' (1985), a Caribbean-inflected reworking of Hans Christian Andersen's story ''The Little Mermaid.'' In Andersen's story, a mermaid's love for a prince is doomed by her inability to survive on land. In Ms. Guy's retelling, a Creole peasant woman falls in love with a wealthy man but finds she cannot transcend his family's class prejudice. The novel was made into a musical, ''Once on This Island,'' with book and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and music by Stephen Flaherty. Directed by Graciela Daniele, it played for more than a year on Broadway in 1990 and 1991 and was nominated for eight Tony Awards. Ms. Guy's own childhood was like something from a fairy tale, though not the kind suffused with light. Rosa Cuthbert was born in Diego Martin, Trinidad, on Sept. 1, 1922. (News accounts have erroneously given the year as 1925 and 1928.) At 7, Rosa arrived in Harlem with her 10-year-old sister, Ameze, to join their parents, who had moved to New York to seek a better life. Their mother died two years later, ''leaving us,'' Ms. Guy said in a 1965 interview, ''with a tyrant of a father, who was terrified at the prospect of raising two girls in the corrupting influence of the big-city life.'' He soon married a well-to-do woman, and for a brief halcyon period, Ms. Guy recounted, the girls ''were swept from abject poverty to a situation where we were being taken to picnics on the weekend in a chauffeur-driven car.'' The marriage foundered, and the girls resumed life with their father, whose behavior was increasingly erratic. By the time Rosa was 14, he too had died. To support herself and her sister -- Ameze was too frail for the task -- Rosa left school for factory work in the garment district. The sisters were eventually shunted through a series of orphanages and foster homes. Hearing the personal narratives of the children she met there, Ms. Guy said, made her realize that her vocation lay in storytelling. Before turning to writing, she studied acting at the American Negro Theater, a Harlem-based group of the 1940s where Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte received early training. With John Oliver Killens and others, Ms. Guy founded the Harlem Writers Guild in 1950. Ms. Guy was a passionate participant in midcentury black nationalist organizations, and in more traditional civil rights groups. Her first book, ''Bird at My Window,'' a critically praised novel for adults published in 1966, told the story of a gifted young black man crushed by systemic poverty and violence. An early marriage, to Warner Guy, ended in divorce; their son, Warner Jr., died in 1995. Ms. Guy's survivors include five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Among her other books are ''Children of Longing'' (1971), a nonfiction volume of interviews with African-American youth she compiled after the assassinations of Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; a trilogy of young-adult novels featuring Imamu Jones, an inquisitive adolescent boy; several picture books; and the adult novel ''A Measure of Time'' (1983), about a self-made woman's rise amid the Harlem Renaissance. For all their surface bleakness, Ms. Guy's books were far from hopeless. Characters often transcended their circumstances through newfound self-awareness and, in particular, through the capacity to forge durable bonds with others. ''She loved to write about love,'' Ms. Angelou said on Wednesday. ''If you thought a situation called for a kind of mournfulness, she was the one to laugh and turn music on and dance.''"

She was 76. The cause was cancer, said Sister Gloria Coleman, a member of the order. As the leader of the Interreligious Task Force, which was established in 1972 to press the Soviet Union to let Jews emigrate without restrictions, Sister Ann picketed Soviet embassies throughout the world and petitioned leaders in Washington and at the United Nations in New York. In 1982 she was one of three human rights advocates who delivered a symbolic writ of habeas corpus to officials at the Soviet Embassy in Washington on behalf of Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet dissident and nuclear physicist then living in exile in central European Russia. Sister Ann, who was born in Texas City, entered the Society of the Holy Child Jesus in 1940 and took her final vows in 1948. She studied at Fordham University and at the Regina Mundi Pontifical Institute in Rome, and received a master's degree in history from Villanova University. She taught at several of the order's high schools around the country in the 1940's and 50's. She was dean of studies at Rosemont College from 1962 to 1964, and taught theology and scripture at Rosemont from 1964 to 1969. Sister Ann was also executive director of the National Coalition of American Nuns in the 1970's and served several terms on the governing board of Common Cause, the public-affairs lobbying organization."

He was 82. The cause was a heart attack, his nephew James E. Souce said. Richard Kluger, whose book ''Ashes to Ashes: America's Hundred-Year Cigarette War, the Public Health and the Unabashed Triumph of Philip Morris'' won a Pulitzer Prize in 1997, said in an email that Mr. Braren ''was among a number of unheralded figures who stood up to the tobacco industry at the time it was perhaps the wealthiest and certainly the deadliest practitioner of unregulated American capitalism.'' Mr. Braren had managed the New York office of the National Association of Broadcasters' Advertising Code Authority and been recently fired from the job when he accused the group's president, Vincent T. Wasilewski, of lying to a House committee about the association's attempts to regulate cigarette advertising. Mr. Wasilewski had told the committee that an association watchdog group was closely monitoring cigarette commercials to make sure they complied with the industry's self-imposed restrictions on pandering to young people. Mr. Braren, testifying later before the same committee, gave a different account. ''In the most candid terms, Congress and the public have been misled as to the real nature of the broadcast self-regulatory program on cigarette commercials,'' Mr. Braren said. He continued: ''They have been told that an active and effective self-regulation program exists. In reality it is virtually nonexistent,'' adding that it had not been functioning for more than a year, when ''broadcast self-regulation became synonymous with trade association lobbying.'' ''While efforts were made at one time by the Code Authority to play a significant role in dealing with the content of cigarette advertising,'' Mr. Braren said, ''these efforts have failed.'' His testimony touched off months of jockeying by tobacco industry lobbyists, whose executives proposed various compromises before finally yielding to a total ban, seeing it as inevitable. Warren Henry Braren was born in Queens on Sept. 2, 1932, the son of Ralph Braren, a customer service representative for a department store, and the former Margaret Hollenbeck. He graduated from New York University with a bachelor's degree in drama and a master's in communication. His wife, the former Bodil Thomsen, and a brother, Howard, also survive him. In the Army, Mr. Braren made training movies for Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He stopped smoking after filming an autopsy that included dissection of a cancerous lung. Before joining the broadcasters association in 1960, he worked as a television commercial supervisor for Ted Bates & Company, the advertising agency, in New York. After he left the Code Authority, he continued his criticism of the broadcasters (''Truth to them is a business truth -- one of economics,'' he said) as executive director of the National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting, an independent watchdog group. He later became executive director of Consumers Union, where he urged that commercials on children's TV shows that condition them ''to buy irrationally and impulsively'' be banned. He was also marketing director for Times Mirror magazines and an independent media consultant. While working for the Code Authority, Mr. Braren said, he had been frustrated trying to enforce the broadcasters' advertising code and was finally driven to blow the whistle by Mr. Wasilewski's public testimony. The House committee agreed to reopen its hearings to accommodate him. He also made available a confidential analysis by the authority's staff of all 372 radio and TV advertisements for cigarettes being broadcast in 1966. ''For the first time broadcasting is confronted with the dilemma of accepting advertising for a product which, through normal and obviously popular use, is potentially if not necessarily capable of inflicting irreparable harm upon the user's health,'' Mr. Braren wrote in the analysis. The analysis found that ''smoking is made to appear universally acceptable, attractive and desirable,'' that ''the adult world depicted in cigarette advertising very often is a world to which the adolescent aspires,'' and that ''the cowboy and the steelworker are symbols of a mature masculinity toward which he strives.'' The staff's recommendations to rule out sports settings, hero images and even depictions of smoking in ads went nowhere, Mr. Braren said. The broadcasters' advertising code was originally adopted to fend off further federal regulation after a 1964 report by the surgeon general declared cigarette smoking a health hazard, barred advertising clearly appealing to buyers under 21 and said that ads ''shall not represent that cigarette smoking is essential to social prominence, distinction, success or sexual attraction.'' Mr. Braren acknowledged that he had been fired shortly before he testified, prompting some defenders of the tobacco industry to dismiss him as a disgruntled former employee. In the House, the chief response to his testimony was a vote to raise the health warning on cigarettes from ''hazardous'' to ''dangerous.'' The Senate was less forgiving of the industry. Broadcasters, who feared a total ban, suggested that cigarette advertising be phased out over several years. But a House-Senate conference committee, meeting in March 1970, agreed on a complete ban that would go into effect on Jan. 2, 1971, and Congress passed it -- while prohibiting mandatory health warnings in nonbroadcast media. In the end, tobacco executives, seeking to stave off stricter regulations, decided that ceasing broadcast commercials would do more harm to potential new competitors than to established brands and accepted the ban, stunning their critics. The industry shifted the focus of advertising to printed publications and popular sponsorships and promotions. The congressional ban took effect at the end of the day on Jan. 1, 1971 -- after the big college football bowl games, and a 90-second Marlboro commercial that concluded with four cowboys galloping into the sunset for the last time."

42515,"George Shearing, Jazz Piano Virtuoso With a Distinctive Sound, Dies at 91","George Shearing, the British piano virtuoso who overcame blindness to become a worldwide jazz star, and whose composition ''Lullaby of Birdland'' became an enduring jazz standard, died on Monday in Manhattan.","George Shearing, the British piano virtuoso who overcame blindness to become a worldwide jazz star, and whose composition ''Lullaby of Birdland'' became an enduring jazz standard, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 91. The cause was congestive heart failure, said his manager, Dale Sheets. Mr. Shearing had homes in Manhattan and Lee, Mass. In 1949, just two years after Mr. Shearing immigrated to the United States, his recording of ''September in the Rain'' became an international hit. Its success established him as a hot property on the jazz nightclub and concert circuit. It established something else as well: the signature sound of the George Shearing Quintet, which was not quite like anything listeners had heard before -- or have heard since. ''When the quintet came out on 1949, it was a very placid and peaceful sound, coming on the end of a very frantic and frenetic era known as bebop,'' Mr. Shearing said in a 1995 interview on the Web site newyorkcritic.org. What he was aiming for, he said, was ''a full block sound, which, if it was scored for saxophones, would sound like the Glenn Miller sound. And coming at the end of the frenetic bebop era, the timing seemed to be right.'' The Shearing sound -- which had the harmonic complexity of bebop but eschewed bebop's ferocious energy -- was built on the unusual instrumentation of vibraphone, guitar, piano, bass and drums. To get the ''full block sound'' he wanted, he had the vibraphone double what his right hand played and the guitar double the left. That sound came to represent the essence of sophisticated hip for countless listeners worldwide who preferred their jazz on the gentle side. The personnel of the Shearing quintet changed many times over the years, but except for the addition of a percussionist in 1953 -- the band continued to be called a quintet even after it became a sextet -- the instrumentation and the sound remained the same for almost three decades. When Mr. Shearing disbanded the group in 1978, it was less because listeners had grown tired of that instrumentation and sound (although the group's popularity, like that of mainstream jazz in general, had declined considerably) than because Mr. Shearing himself had. ''I had an identity. I held on to it for 29 years. Eventually I held on like grim death,'' he told John S. Wilson of The New York Times in 1986. ''The last five years I played on automatic pilot. I could do the whole show in my sleep.'' Shortly after breaking up the group, Mr. Shearing said, ''There won't be another quintet unless Standard Oil or Frank Sinatra want it.'' Standard Oil never asked, but in 1981 Mr. Shearing reassembled the quintet for a Boston engagement and a series of Carnegie Hall concerts as Mr. Sinatra's opening act. He returned to the quintet format on occasion after that, but it was never again his primary focus. His preferred format became the piano-bass duo, originally with Brian Torff and later with Don Thompson and Neil Swainson. He also performed with bass and drums and, on occasion, unaccompanied. In the 1980s and '90s he had great success in concert and on record with the singer Mel Torme. By his own estimate Mr. Shearing wrote about 300 tunes, of which he liked to joke that roughly 295 were completely unknown. He nevertheless contributed at least one bona fide standard to the jazz repertory: ''Lullaby of Birdland,'' written in 1952 and adopted as the theme song of the world-famous New York nightclub where he frequently performed.

30539,"Bill Melendez, 91, 'Peanuts' Animator, Dies","Bill Melendez, an Emmy-winning animator who brought Charlie Brown and the ''Peanuts'' gang to blithe, blockheaded life on television and in films -- and who helped keep them alive after the death of their creator, Charles M. Schulz -- died on Tuesday in Santa Monica, Calif.","Bill Melendez, an Emmy-winning animator who brought Charlie Brown and the ''Peanuts'' gang to blithe, blockheaded life on television and in films -- and who helped keep them alive after the death of their creator, Charles M. Schulz -- died on Tuesday in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 91 and lived in Los Angeles. Mr. Melendez's son Steven confirmed the death, saying his father had been in declining health after a fall last year. One of the very few Hispanics in the business when he began his career in the 1930s, Mr. Melendez was the only animator Mr. Schulz allowed to shepherd his characters onto the screen. He did so in more than four dozen TV specials, four feature films, a slew of Saturday-morning cartoons and scores of commercials. Mr. Melendez won six Emmy Awards, starting with ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' (1965), the first ''Peanuts'' television special and still a holiday staple. From that program onward, Mr. Melendez also supplied the ''voice,'' such as it was, of Snoopy. His other ''Peanuts'' work, produced with his longtime collaborator Lee Mendelson, includes the specials ''You're a Good Sport, Charlie Brown'' (1975) and ''Life Is a Circus, Charlie Brown'' (1980), both of which received Emmys, and the feature films ''A Boy Named Charlie Brown'' (1969) and ''Snoopy, Come Home'' (1972). After Mr. Schulz's death in 2000, Mr. Melendez animated several more ''Peanuts'' specials, among them ''Lucy Must Be Traded, Charlie Brown,'' first broadcast in 2003. Jose Cuauhtemoc Melendez was born on Nov. 15, 1916, in Hermosillo, in the Mexican state of Sonora. His father, a Mexican Army cavalry officer who later became a general, was a romantic who gave his children Aztec names, Steven Melendez said on Thursday. (Cuauhtemoc was a 16th-century Aztec ruler.) Growing up, Jose drew everything in sight: horses, cattle, cowboys. In 1928 his mother moved with him and his siblings to Arizona so they could learn English. Jose, then about 12, was placed in a kindergarten class, a humiliation, his son said, that forced him to learn his new language in a hurry. The family later moved to Los Angeles. As a young man, Mr. Melendez planned to be an engineer, but the Depression intervened. He held a series of odd jobs, including working in a lumberyard, before a friend persuaded him to show his drawings to the Walt Disney company. Disney suggested formal training; after Mr. Melendez studied briefly at the Chouinard Art Institute, Disney hired him in 1938. There he helped animate ''Fantasia'' (1940), ''Pinocchio'' (1940) and myriad Mickey Mouse cartoons. He also acquired a new name. After asking Disney to bill him as Cuauhtemoc Melendez, he was informed that his name was too wide for the credits and that he would hereafter be known as Bill. In 1941 Mr. Melendez left Disney after an animators' strike he helped organize. He joined Leon Schlesinger Productions (later acquired by Warner Brothers), where he worked on Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. He formed his own studio, Bill Melendez Productions, in 1964. Mr. Melendez and Mr. Schulz met in the late 1950s over a Ford Falcon. Mr. Melendez had been engaged by the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency to produce an animated commercial for the car. The Ford Motor Company wanted to use ''Peanuts'' characters in the spot. Mr. Schulz demurred until he saw Mr. Melendez's drawings. They were noteworthy for their fealty to Mr. Schulz's style; instead of embellishing the comic strip's flat figures and clean, simple lines, Mr. Melendez kept them much as they were. Mr. Melendez's other work included the TV special ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' (1979); he also animated the specials ''Garfield on the Town'' (1983) and ''Cathy'' (1987), both of which won Emmys. Besides his son, Steven Cuitlahuac, the president of Bill Melendez Productions, Mr. Melendez is survived by his wife, the former Helen Huhn, whom he married in 1940; another son, Rodrigo Cuauhtemoc, a retired rear admiral of the United States Navy; six grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren. Mr. Melendez's second career as the voice of Snoopy happened entirely by accident. Because Mr. Schulz would not countenance the idea of a beagle uttering English dialogue, Mr. Melendez recited gibberish into a tape recorder, speeded it up and put the result on the soundtrack. For his decades of squeaks, squawks and grunts, Mr. Melendez received residuals to the end of his life."

Dinkins, died of cancer Sunday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.","Daniel L. Burrows, a businessman and former Democratic leader in Harlem who became the father-in-law and a political mentor of Mayor David N. Dinkins, died of cancer Sunday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 83 years old and lived in Belmar, N.J. His death was announced Sunday night by the Mayor's office. Mr. Burrows, a native of Cape Charles, Va., came to New York as a child. He was a real-estate and insurance broker and helped found the United Mutual Life Insurance Company, whose headquarters are on Lenox Avenue at 125th Street. He also entered Democratic politics, becoming one of the first black politicians to gain a foothold in the inner circles of what was then the Tammany party organization in Manhattan. He began as a member of the executive committee of his local Democratic club. Memorable Weapons Lesson In 1938, he became the second black to be named a state committeeman, representing Manhattan. In 1939, he was elected to the State Assembly, which had seen few black members, and served two terms. One of his most memorable feats there happened in early 1939 during a debate on a bill to classify as dangerous weapons those typically used by warring gangsters, including machine guns, sawed-off shotguns and blackjacks. Addressing the chamber in support of the bill, Assemblyman Burrows suddenly brandished a switchblade knife, snapped its catch and swished its four-inch blade through the air. News accounts at the time said he made his point convincingly. The demonstration virtually scared the members into dropping all further talk and passing the bill 140 to 0. In 1939, Mr. Burrows was also elected Tammany leader of what was then the 19th Assembly District in Harlem; he was only the second black politician to gain a seat on the county executive committee. His activities led him to encourage Mr. Dinkins, who married Mr. Burrows's daughter Joyce, to enter the political arena, too. Mr. Burrows is also survived by another daughter, Gloria Sparks; a sister, Jeanne Fox; a brother, Jack; four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. His wife, Elaine, died in 1975. A memorial service will be held at 9:30 A.M. Thursday at the Church of the Intercession, at 550 West 155th Street in Manhattan."

The cause was cancer, her family said. Mrs. Williamson, who continued to work until earlier this month, helped set up the foundation in 1980 and became a leader of the community-foundation movement in the United States. Such organizations collect endowed funds from individuals, businesses or private foundations to benefit innovative projects in a specific area. Mrs. Williamson became the executive director of what began as the Essex County Community Foundation in 1980. Starting with little more than a borrowed desk and a phone, she nurtured the foundation into an organization with assets of about $11.5 million and distributions of more than $6 million. Its donors include such corporate giants as Johnson & Johnson and the AT&T Corporation, and the Newark Boys Chorus, the New Jersey Symphony, AIDS education, neighborhood initiatives, civic improvements and various social services have been among the beneficiaries. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is a trustee and former president but the foundation operates with little fanfare, Mrs. Williamson was active in many local organizations, including the United Way of Essex and West Hudson, the Association for Children in New Jersey and the Orange Orphan Society.

He was 93. Dr. Stratton, who had most recently lived in Cambridge, Mass., died of pneumonia, said Charles Ball, an M.I.T spokesman. As the 11th president of M.I.T., Dr. Stratton, a physicist and electrical engineer, headed one of the world's leading centers of scientific research and education. Dr. Paul A. Gray, the university's 14th president and current chairman of its board, said yesterday through a spokesman that while Dr. Stratton was president, his ""strong commitment to the arts and humanities at M.I.T. was particularly important in a period when those activities were first flowering."" Transformation of M.I.T. Under Dr. Stratton's leadership, which began in 1957 when he was named acting president of the university, major innovations in teaching and curriculum development changed the environment of scientific education at M.I.T. Interdisciplinary centers were founded for space research, the earth sciences, the life sciences, materials science, engineering and advanced engineering study, and the construction of buildings to house the centers transformed the landscape of the Cambridge campus. It was while Dr. Stratton was president and male students outnumbered female students by about 60 to 1 that M.I.T. began planning its first women's dormitory. Women's potential in science, he said at the time, represents one of the ""great latent resources of the country."" In 1966, when he turned 65, Dr. Stratton reached mandatory retirement age and was succeeded by Dr. Howard W. Johnson, who had been dean of M.I.T.'s Alfred P. Sloan School of Management. The Stratton era and that of his predecessor, Dr. James R. Killian, Jr., who was president from 1948 to 1959, marked M.I.T.'s transformation from a technical institution into what has been called ""a university polarized around science."" M.I.T. Freshman in 1920 Dr. Stratton was born in Seattle on May 18, 1901, the son of Julius A. Stratton, a lawyer and judge, and the former Laura Adams, a concert pianist. His long association with M.I.T. began in 1920 as a freshman after making the trip from Seattle aboard a ship bound for Boston by signing on as a radio operator. After receiving a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1923, he studied French literature for a year at Grenoble and Toulouse universities in France. He then returned to M.I.T. and received a master's degree in electrical engineering in 1926. He studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, earning a doctoral degree in mathematical physics in 1928, and returned to M.I.T. as an assistant professor of electrical engineering. In 1930 he switched to the physics department, where he became an associate professor in 1935. Dr. Stratton rose through the academic ranks to become a full professor of physics in 1941, and held a several administrative posts before being named acting president in 1957. When he became chairman of the Ford Foundation, of which he had been a trustee since 1955, Dr. Stratton oversaw the wealthiest philanthropic organization in the world. He has been credited with important changes in the foundation's policies and procedures that, among other things, increased its flexibility in policy making. He retired in 1971. As a scientist, Dr. Stratton worked in the burgeoning field of communications and communications theory in the 1920's. In the next decade he was active in the revitalization of M.I.T.'s physics department. His writings included the book ""Electromagnetic Theory"" (McGraw Hill, 1941), which is still in print. In World War II, Dr. Stratton joined the staff of M.I.T.'s Radiation Laboratory and worked on the development of Loran, or Long Range Navigation, a system of radio technology by which a ship or airplane can determine its position. He also helped to plan the use of radar in the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. From 1946 through 1949 he was the first director of M.I.T.'s Research Laboratory of Electronics, which adopted the Radiation Laboratory's interdisciplinary approach to research and became a model for that approach at M.I.T. and elsewhere. Over the years, Dr. Stratton was awarded 17 honorary degrees from educational institutions in the United States and other countries. He is survived by his wife, the former Catherine N. Coffman, whom he married in 1935; three daughters, Catherine Nelson Stratton and Laura Thoresby, both of London, and Cary F. Boyd of Newbury, Mass., and a granddaughter."

He was 63. The cause was lung cancer, Providence announced. Playing for three seasons at Providence, Walker, who was reared in Boston, became the college's career leader with 2,045 points, a record that stood until 2005, when it was eclipsed by Ryan Gomes. In 1966-67, his senior season, Walker led the nation in scoring, averaging 30.4 points a game, and he was selected by the Detroit Pistons as the No. 1 pick in the N.B.A. draft. Walker, 6 feet 3 inches, played five seasons for the Pistons and later played for the Houston Rockets and the Kansas City Kings, averaging 16.7 points for nine N.B.A. seasons. ''He had the skills that would mesh well with the game today,'' Dave Bing, the Hall of Fame guard who played alongside Walker with the Pistons, recalled yesterday on the team's Web site. ''He had range, so he could shoot the 3-pointer. He had an unbelievable ability to handle the ball for someone his size.'' When the University of Michigan's celebrated Fab Five team was playing in the 1992 N.C.A.A. tournament, it became known that Walker was the father of Jalen Rose, a star guard-forward on that team. Walker had never married Rose's mother, Jeanne, who named Jalen for Walker, whose given name was James, and for her brother, Leonard. And he essentially had no contact with the family over the years. ''Everyone tells me my father was a great player,'' Rose, who had seen tapes of Walker playing, told The Star-Tribune of Minneapolis in April 1992. Walker told Mitch Albom in an interview for ''Fab Five'' (Warner Books, 1993): ''I didn't handle the situation well. I remember Jeanne being angry.'' But Walker added: ''I don't have any regrets or apologies about Jalen. That's just the way things sometimes happen.'' Walker lived in Kansas City, Mo., in recent years, according to The Kansas City Star. Providence did not list survivors. In February 2005 with the Toronto Raptors, Rose scored 26 points in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers. ''I woke up today, and somebody sent me an e-mail and told me if I score 10 points, I'll pass my biological father,'' Rose said afterward, referring to Walker having scored 11,655 career points. ''That's what I used as motivation.''"

55603,"Jacques Derrida, Abstruse Theorist, Dies in Paris at 74","Jacques Derrida, the Algerian-born, French intellectual who became one of the most celebrated and notoriously difficult philosophers of the late 20th century, died Friday at a Paris hospital, the French president's office announced.","Jacques Derrida, the Algerian-born, French intellectual who became one of the most celebrated and notoriously difficult philosophers of the late 20th century, died Friday at a Paris hospital, the French president's office announced. He was 74. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, according to French television, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Derrida was known as the father of deconstruction, the method of inquiry that asserted that all writing was full of confusion and contradiction, and that the author's intent could not overcome the inherent contradictions of language itself, robbing texts -- whether literature, history or philosophy -- of truthfulness, absolute meaning and permanence. The concept was eventually applied to the whole gamut of arts and social sciences, including linguistics, anthropology, political science, even architecture. While he had a huge following -- larger in the United States than in Europe -- he was the target of as much anger as admiration. For many Americans, in particular, he was the personification of a French school of thinking they felt was undermining many of the traditional standards of classical education, and one they often associated with divisive political causes. Literary critics broke texts into isolated passages and phrases to find hidden meanings. Advocates of feminism, gay rights, and third-world causes embraced the method as an instrument to reveal the prejudices and inconsistencies of Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Freud and other ''dead white male'' icons of Western culture. Architects and designers could claim to take a ''deconstructionist'' approach to buildings by abandoning traditional symmetry and creating zigzaggy, sometimes disquieting spaces. The filmmaker Woody Allen titled one of his movies ''Deconstructing Harry,'' to suggest that his protagonist could best be understood by breaking down and analyzing his neurotic contradictions. A Code Word for Discourse Toward the end of the 20th century, deconstruction became a code word of intellectual discourse, much as existentialism and structuralism -- two other fashionable, slippery philosophies that also emerged from France after World War II -- had been before it. Mr. Derrida and his followers were unwilling -- some say unable -- to define deconstruction with any precision, so it has remained misunderstood, or interpreted in endlessly contradictory ways. Typical of Mr. Derrida's murky explanations of his philosophy was a 1993 paper he presented at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, in New York, which began: ''Needless to say, one more time, deconstruction, if there is such a thing, takes place as the experience of the impossible.'' Mr. Derrida was a prolific writer, but his 40-plus books on various aspects of deconstruction were no more easily accessible. Even some of their titles -- ''Of Grammatology,'' ''The Postcard: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond,'' and ''Ulysses Gramophone: Hear Say Yes in Joyce'' -- could be off-putting to the uninitiated. ''Many otherwise unmalicious people have in fact been guilty of wishing for deconstruction's demise -- if only to relieve themselves of the burden of trying to understand it,'' Mitchell Stephens, a journalism professor at New York University, wrote in a 1994 article in The New York Times Magazine. Mr. Derrida's credibility was also damaged by a 1987 scandal involving Paul de Man, a Yale University professor who was the most acclaimed exponent of deconstruction in the United States. Four years after Mr. de Man's death, it was revealed that he had contributed numerous pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic articles to a newspaper in Belgium, where he was born, while it was under German occupation during World War II. In defending his dead colleague, Mr. Derrida, a Jew, was understood by some people to be condoning Mr. de Man's anti-Semitism. A Devoted Following Nonetheless, during the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Derrida's writings and lectures gained him a huge following in major American universities -- in the end, he proved far more influential in the United States than in France. For young, ambitious professors, his teachings became a springboard to tenure in faculties dominated by senior colleagues and older, shopworn philosophies. For many students, deconstruction was a right of passage into the world of rebellious intellect. Jacques Derrida was born on July 15, 1930, in El-Biar, Algeria. His father was a salesman. At age 12, he was expelled from his French school when the rector, adhering to the Vichy government's racial laws, ordered a drastic cut in Jewish enrollment. Even as a teenager, Mr. Derrida (the name is pronounced day-ree-DAH) was a voracious reader whose eclectic interests embraced the philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, and the poet Paul Valery. But he could be an indifferent student. He failed his baccalaureate in his first attempt. He twice failed his entrance exam to the Ecole Normal Superieure, the traditional cradle of French intellectuals, where he was finally admitted in 1952. There he failed the oral portion of his final exams on his first attempt. After graduation in 1956, he studied briefly at Harvard University. For most of the next 30 years, he taught philosophy and logic at both the University of Paris and the Ecole Normal Superieure. Yet he did not defend his doctoral dissertation until 1980, when he was 50 years old. By the early 1960's, Mr. Derrida had made a name for himself as a rising young intellectual in Paris by publishing articles on language and philosophy in leading academic journals. He was especially influenced by the German philosophers, Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Both were strong critics of traditional metaphysics, a branch of philosophy which explored the basis and perception of reality. As a lecturer, Mr. Derrida cultivated charisma and mystery. For many years, he declined to be photographed for publication. He cut a dashing, handsome figure at the lectern, with his thick thatch of prematurely white hair, tanned complexion, and well-tailored suits. He peppered his lectures with puns, rhymes and enigmatic pronouncements, like, ''Thinking is what we already know that we have not yet begun,'' or, ''Oh my friends, there is no friend'' Many readers found his prose turgid and baffling, even as aficionados found it illuminating. A single sentence could run for three pages, and a footnote even longer. Sometimes his books were written in ''deconstructed'' style. For example, ''Glas'' (1974) offers commentaries on the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and the French novelist Jean Genet in parallel columns of the book's pages; in between, there is an occasional third column of commentary about the two men's ideas. ''The trouble with reading Mr. Derrida is that there is too much perspiration for too little inspiration,'' editorialized The Economist in 1992, when Cambridge University awarded the philosopher an honorary degree after a bruising argument among his supporters and critics on the faculty. Elsewhere in Europe, Mr. Derrida's deconstruction philosophy gained earlier and easier acceptance. Shaking Up a Discipline Mr. Derrida appeared on the American intellectual landscape at a 1966 conference on the French intellectual movement known as structuralism at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore. Its high priest was French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, who studied societies through their linguistic structure. Mr. Derrida shocked his American audience by announcing that structuralism was already passe in France, and that Mr. Levi-Strauss's ideas were too rigid. Instead, Mr. Derrida offered deconstruction as the new, triumphant philosophy. His presentation fired up young professors who were in search of a new intellectual movement to call their own. In a Los Angeles Times Magazine article in 1991, Mr. Stephens, the journalism professor, wrote: ''He gave literature professors a special gift: a chance to confront -- not as mere second-rate philosophers, not as mere interpreters of novelists, but as full-fledged explorers in their own right -- the most profound paradoxes of Western thought.'' ''If they really read, if they stared intently enough at the metaphors,'' he went on, ''literature professors, from the comfort of their own easy chairs, could reveal the hollowness of the basic assumptions that lie behind all our writings.'' Other critics found it disturbing that obscure academics could presume to denigrate a Sophocles, Voltaire or Tolstoy by seeking out cultural biases and inexact language in their masterpieces. ''Literature, the deconstructionists frequently proved, had been written by entirely the wrong people for entirely the wrong reasons,'' wrote Malcolm Bradbury, a British novelist and professor, in a 1991 article for The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Derrida's influence was especially strong in the Yale University literature department, where one of his close friends, a Belgian-born professor, Paul de Man, emerged as a leading champion of deconstruction in literary analysis. Mr. de Man had claimed to be a refugee from war-torn Europe, and even left the impression among colleagues that he had joined the Belgian resistance. But in 1987, four years after Mr. de Man's death, research revealed that he had written over 170 articles in the early 1940's for Le Soir, a Nazi newspaper in Belgium. Some of these articles were openly anti-Semitic, including one that echoed Nazi calls for ''a final solution'' and seemed to defend the notion of concentration camps. ''A solution to the Jewish problem that aimed at the creation of a Jewish colony isolated from Europe would entail no deplorable consequences for the literary life of the West,'' wrote Mr. de Man. The revelations became a major scandal at Yale and other campuses where the late Mr. de Man had been lionized as an intellectual hero. Some former colleagues asserted that the scandal was being used to discredit deconstruction by people who were always hostile to the movement. But Mr. Derrida gave fodder to critics by defending Mr. de Man, and even using literary deconstruction techniques in an attempt to demonstrate that the Belgian scholar's newspaper articles were not really anti-Semitic. ''Borrowing Derrida's logic one could deconstruct Mein Kampf to reveal that [Adolf Hitler] was in conflict with anti-Semitism,'' scoffed Peter Lennon, in a 1992 article for The Guardian. According to another critic, Mark Lilla, in a 1998 article in The New York Review of Books, Mr. Derrida's contortionist defense of his old friend left ''the impression that deconstruction means you never have to say you're sorry.'' Almost as devastating for deconstruction and Mr. Derrida was the revelation, also in 1987, that Heidegger, one of his intellectual muses, was a dues-paying member of the Nazi Party from 1933 to 1945. Once again, Mr. Derrida was accused by critics of being irresolute, this time for failing to condemn Heidegger's fascist ideas. By the late 1980's, Mr. Derrida's intellectual star was on the wane on both sides of the Atlantic. But he continued to commute between France and the United States, where he was paid hefty fees to lecture a few weeks every year at several East Coast universities and the University of California at Irvine. Lifting a Mysterious Aura In his early years of intellectual fame, Mr. Derrida was criticized by European leftists for a lack of political commitment -- indeed, for espousing a philosophy that attacked the very concept of absolute political certainties. But in the 1980's, he became active in a number of political causes, opposing apartheid, defending Czech dissidents and supporting the rights of North African immigrants in France. Mr. Derrida also became far more accessible to the media. He sat still for photos and gave interviews that stripped away his formerly mysterious aura to reveal the mundane details of his personal life. A former Yale student, Amy Ziering Kofman, focused on him in a 2002 documentary, ''Derrida,'' that some reviewers found charming. ''With his unruly white hair and hawklike face, Derrida is a compelling presence even when he is merely pondering a question,'' wrote Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times. ''Even his off-the-cuff comments are intriguing, because everything gets serious consideration. And when he is wary, he's never difficult for its own sake but because his philosophical positions make him that way.'' Rather than hang around the Left Bank cafes traditionally inhabited by French intellectuals, Mr. Derrida preferred the quiet of Ris-Orangis, a suburb south of Paris, where he lived in a small house with his wife, Marguerite Aucouturier, a psychoanalyst. The couple had two sons, Pierre and Jean. He also had a son, Daniel, with Sylviane Agacinski, a philosophy teacher who later married the French political leader Lionel Jospin. As a young man, Mr. Derrida confessed, he hoped to become a professional soccer player. And he admitted to being an inveterate viewer of television, watching everything from news to soap operas. ''I am critical of what I'm watching,'' said Mr. Derrida with mock pride. ''I deconstruct all the time.'' Late in his career, Mr. Derrida was asked, as he had been so often, what deconstruction was. ''Why don't you ask a physicist or a mathematician about difficulty?'' he replied, frostily, to Dinitia Smith, a Times reporter, in a 1998. ''Deconstruction requires work. If deconstruction is so obscure, why are the audiences in my lectures in the thousands? They feel they understand enough to understand more.'' Asked later in the same interview to at least define deconstruction, Mr. Derrida said: ''It is impossible to respond. I can only do something which will leave me unsatisfied.''"

He was 54 years old. Mr. Guibourge introduced the collection in 1977, six years after Coco Chanel's death. ''The clothes work,'' Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times. ''He not only kept the look, he kept the faith. The clothes are Chanel updated.'' At the time, Mr. Guibourge said, ''It was difficult to keep the look but not to repeat it - exactly.'' He left Chanel in 1982 and, after a stint with Chloe, where he was hired to back up Guy Paulin, he founded his own fashion house. Admirers of Mr. Guibourge say that he was the French designer who started using vinyl for sportswear and that he designed the first longer, closer-cut ski parkas. In the 1960's, he was one of the young designers who shook up the French haute couture. He moved to Dior in 1960, at Marc Bohan's request, from Jacques Fath, where he helped design Fath's first ready-to-wear collection. As head of the Christian Dior boutique, designer of the Colifichet collections sold one flight up from the boutique, and Mr. Bohan's right-hand man in designing the couture collections, he made the final choice on everything it sold, from scarves and sweaters to jewelry, lingerie and knickknacks."

Cori, the biochemist who shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1947 with his first wife, died yesterday at his home in Cambridge, Mass.","Dr. Carl F. Cori, the biochemist who shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1947 with his first wife, died yesterday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 87 years old and was active in medical research until his death. Dr. Cori and his wife, Gerty, who died in 1957, were named Nobel laureates for their research that led to the isolation and synthesis of phosphorylase, an enzyme that begins the process of converting the animal starch glycogen into sugar in the body. They won half the prize; the other half went to an Argentine scientist. The Coris were the third married couple to receive a Nobel Prize in scientific research, the others being Pierre and Marie Curie in 1903 and Frederick and Irene Joliot, a daughter of Marie Curie, in 1935. The Coris, who came to the United States from Czechoslovakia in 1922 and became naturalized Americans in 1928, worked together as a research team in the fields of pharmacology and biochemistry for 34 years. Discovery Made in '42 The presence in muscle tissue of the enzyme that the Coris later named phosphorylase was discovered by them and their associates at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis in 1942. Dr. Carl Cori was associated with the school for 35 years. After the death of his first wife he married Anne Fitz-Gerald Jones of St. Louis in 1960. Six years later, after his retirement as head of the department of biochemistry at Washington University's medical school, he moved to Cambridge, where he became visiting professor of biological chemistry at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard University School of Medicine. Carl Ferdinand Cori was born Dec. 5, 1896, in Prague, the son of a doctor. His studies in medicine at Carl Ferdinand University in Prague were interrupted by service in the Austrian army in World War I. He received his medical degree in 1920, the same year that he married Gerty Radnitz, a fellow medical student. After further study at the clinic for internal medicine and the pharmacological institute at the University of Vienna, Dr. Cori was invited in 1922 to come to the United States to head the laboratory at the New York State Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease in Buffalo, later renamed the Roswell Park Memorial Institute. His wife was assigned to the institute's pathology department. First Paper on Glycogen The title of their first paper, published in Buffalo in 1923, ''Free Sugar Content of the Liver and Its Relation to Glycogensynthesis and Glycogenolysis,'' reflected the direction and primary focus of their research for the ensuing 34 years of their life together. In 1931, Dr. Cori left Buffalo to become a professor of pharmacology at the Washington University medical school. He was later named professor of pharmacology and biochemistry, and in 1946 he was named chairman of the department of biochemistry. Besides the Nobel Prize, Dr. Cori received many honors, including one of the first Albert and Mary Lasker Awards of the American Public Health Association in 1946, the Sugar Research Award of the National Science Fund of the National Academy of Science in 1947, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948 and to the Royal Society, the leading scientific body in Britain and the oldest in the world, in 1950. He also received an honorary doctor of science degree from Cambridge University in 1949. Besides his wife, he is survived by a son from his first marriage, Thomas Cori of St. Louis; two stepdaughters, Mary Cori-Jones of Cambridge and Carroll West-Jones of Long Island; two stepsons, Thomas Jones of Topeka, Kan., and Robert Jones of St. Louis, and two grandchildren. The funeral service will be private. A memorial service is planned later in Cambridge."

He was 87 years old. He died of cancer after a long illness under the care of the Hospice of Southwest Florida, said one of his three daughters, Barbara F. Mishkin, of Chevy Chase, Md. It was while teaching physiology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in the early 1930's that Dr. Friedman developed his test for pregnancy, which became widely known as the ""rabbit test."" In the test, a woman's urine sample was injected into a female rabbit. If the woman was pregnant, the urine would contains hormones that would cause formations, known as corpora lutea and corpora hemorrhagica, in the rabbit's ovaries. The popular belief that the rabbit died as a result of a positive test itself was not true. Rather, the rabbit would be killed before a laboratory cut it open to determine whether the ovary formations had developed. 'It's Highly Reliable' Asked to comment on the efficiency of his test, Dr. Friedman would say: ""It's highly reliable. The only more reliable test is to wait nine months."" But later the Friedman test was replaced by pregnancy kits that determine the presence of the hormones in pregnant women without the use of animals. A gastroenterologist, Dr. Friedman served for several years as a member of the staff of Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. He was also associate professor of medicine at the Georgtown medical school and vice chairman of the department of medicine at Washington Hospital Center. Born Oct. 27, 1903, in Gary, Ind., he entered the University of Chicago at the age of 16. Upon receiving his bachelor's degree, he went on to earn his Ph.D and M.D. at the university. In 1928, he joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught and did research in the department of physiology. In 1936, he settled in Washington and went to work for the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, where he pursued his research in reproductive physiology. Served in Army Air Force During World War II Dr. Friedman served with the Army Air Forces as a medical officer. In 1946 he opened a private practice in internal medicine in Washington. Retiring from his practice in 1959, he remained active in civic affairs, serving as financial adviser to the Planned Parenthood Association.

54271,"David Hamilton, Photographer Known for Nude Images of Girls, Dies at 83","Mr. Hamilton, whose soft dreamy style defined his photographs fashion and advertising assignments in the 1960s, was the target of rape allegations.","Mr. Hamilton, whose soft dreamy style defined his photographs fashion and advertising assignments in the 1960s, was the target of rape allegations. Correction Appended David Hamilton, the British photographer whose diaphanous images of prepubescent girls blurred the line between art and pornography, was found dead on Friday in his Paris apartment, one week after a former model accused him of raping her in 1987 when she was 13. He was 83. The police said that the cause appeared to be suicide but their investigation was continuing. Beginning with ""Bilitis"" in 1977, Mr. Hamilton directed five erotic movies that largely centered on blossoming sexuality in flower-crowned girls. The films were shot in the dreamy soft-focus style that also defined his photographs for fashion and advertising assignments in the 1960s and '70s, and for more than two dozen books. When his photographs were shown in the late 1970s at Images Gallery in Manhattan, Gene Thornton wrote in The New York Times that they reveal ""the kind of ideal that regularly was expressed in the great paintings of the past."" In ""Contemporary Photographers,"" the curator and photographer Christian Caujolle wrote that Mr. Hamilton worked with only two fixed devices: ""a clear pictorial intention and a latent eroticism, ostensibly romantic, but asking for trouble."" The nudity prompted a number of prosecutions against book buyers on charges of possession of child pornography, though in most cases the charges were dropped or the verdicts overturned. There were also bans and boycotts of Mr. Hamilton's books in some places. His critics said his photographs flagrantly objectified young women. He said they captured the ""candor of a lost paradise."" ""Nudity and purity, sensuality and innocence, grace and spontaneity - we made contradictions of them,"" he said in 1995. ""I try to harmonize them, and that's my secret and the reason for my success."" He became the target of criminal allegations in October, when a French radio and television personality, Flavie Flament, published a novelistic memoir, ""The Consolation,"" in which she describes being raped by a photographer at a nudist camp in the South of France when she was 13. Afraid of being sued, she said, she did not name Mr. Hamilton, but his portrait of her is on the book's cover. After the book was published, two other former models anonymously told a weekly magazine that they, too, had been raped by Mr. Hamilton. On Nov. 18, after Ms. Flament said she was contacted by several former models who made similar allegations, she identified Mr. Hamilton by name. Under French law, a woman cannot file rape charges more than 20 years after reaching the age of 18. Ms. Flament said she was so traumatized by the episode that the memories of it returned only about four years ago, when she was 38. In response, Mr. Hamilton told Agence France-Presse: ""Today I am the subject of no legal proceedings. This oversteps the presumption of innocence. I am innocent and must be considered so. The instigator of this media lynching is seeking her quarter of an hour of fame through slander."" Ms. Flament, speaking to The Sunday Times of London, called Mr. Hamilton's death ""a cowardly act."" ""The horror of this news will never erase that of our sleepless nights,"" she said. Last week Laurence Rossignol, the French minister of families, children and women's rights, asked Ms. Flament and a criminal lawyer to explore whether the statute of limitations for juvenile rape should be extended. In the Sunday Times interview, she said that at one photo shoot, in his apartment in Cap d'Agde, in the South of France, Mr. Hamilton appeared at the door naked, wearing only a camera around his neck. ""That would have been a good moment for my mother to say, 'O.K., we're leaving now,' "" she recalled, ""but instead it was just, 'What time shall I pick her up?' "" Mr. Hamilton was born on April 15, 1933, in London. As a boy, during World War II, he was evacuated to Dorset, but returned to London for school. Afterward he worked for an architect. He soon began a series of moves back and forth across the English Channel: working as a graphic designer for Elle magazine in Paris, returning to London to be art director of Queen magazine - and there buying his first camera - then returning to France to be art director for the Printemps department store. It was in France that Mr. Hamilton, who had no formal training in the field, began photographing commercially. His marriage to Gertrude Hamilton, who helped design one of his books, ended in divorce.They had no children. He divided his time between St. Tropez and Paris, where he lived in the Montparnasse district. Correction: December 1, 2016, Thursday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Tuesday about the photographer David Hamilton misstated the area of Paris where he lived. It is Montparnasse, not Montmartre. The obituary also misstated his marital history. He was married once, not twice. (The model Mona Kristensen used the surname Hamilton professionally when she worked with him, but they were never married.)"

Massey, a onetime pharmacist from Georgia who became a venture capitalist and headed Kentucky Fried Chicken and the Hospital Corporation of America, died of viral pneumonia yesterday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 85 years old and had lived in Nashville for half a century, wintering in Palm Beach. Mr. Massey began his business career as a delivery boy for his uncle's drugstore in Tennille, Ga., where he was born. He received a pharmacist's license when he was 19 years old and bought his first drugstore when he was 25. He built the store into a chain and sold it six years later to become a purveyor of surgical supplies to hospitals and doctors. In 1961 Mr. Massey sold the surgical supply business to a subsidiary of the Brunswick Corporation for $1 million, with the goal of retiring to Florida. But he became bored with retirement, and in his mid-50's began looking for a new business challenge. He settled on the Kentucky Fried Chicken Company. Fried Chicken Success Story He and John Y. Brown Jr., a lawyer who later became Governor of Kentucky, bought Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1964 from Harland Sanders, the honorary colonel who had founded the chain, and embarked on a vigorous expansion program. By 1971, when they sold it to the Heublein Corporation, Kentucky Fried Chicken, now a unit of Pepsico Inc., had 3,500 franchises grossing more than $700 million annually. In 1968, Mr. Massey founded the Hospital Corporation of America, a management concern, with three longtime Nashville friends. In a decade it became the country's largest owner and operator of hospitals; Mr. Massey left active management of the company in 1978. Again he did not retire. Less than a year later he went back into the fast-food business, acquiring Winner's Corporation, one of the country's largest franchisees of Wendy's International hamburger outlets. When his new acquisition, now called the Volunteer Capital Corporation, had its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Massey became the first entrepreneur to have taken three separate ventures - Kentucky Fried Chicken and the Hospital Corporation were the others - onto the New York stock list. Over the years Mr. Massey was instrumental in starting and financing many businesses, making public offerings of the shares of more than a dozen private companies and providing capital for three dozen others that remained private. He continued to manage his own venture capital firm, the Massey Investment Company, until his death. Had Fun Accomplishing Of his appetite for financial adventure, Mr. Massey once said: ''Lots of people have more than I do, but not many have as much fun. The fun is in the accomplishing.'' A founder of Baptist Hospital in Nashville, now one of the South's largest medical centers, Mr. Massey was a trustee for 20 years and its chairman for 12. He contributed to many educational and cultural institutions. Belmont College in Nashville established the Jack C. Massey Graduate School of Business in his name. Mr. Massey's first wife, the former Elizabeth Polak, died in 1969. He is survived by his second wife, the former Alyne Queener; a daughter, Barbara Clark of Nashville, and three grandchlidren."
37994,"Robert Palladino, a Master Calligrapher, Is Dead at 83","Because of a Trappist monk, Apple computer displays look the way they do today.","Because of a Trappist monk, Apple computer displays look the way they do today. The monk was the Rev. Robert Palladino, who died on Feb. 26 at 83. A Roman Catholic priest who began his vocation in a monastic order, Father Palladino was also a world-renowned master of calligraphy. ''Priest and calligrapher,'' his business card read, in his unimpeachable Renaissance italic, and he long plied both trades at once. For years, babies he baptized received baptismal certificates in his flawless hand. In Oregon, where he made his home, Father Palladino hand-lettered the state medical licenses for generations of newly minted doctors. As a Trappist brother, Father Palladino learned his art in silence, honed it over years of study and eventually, on leaving his order, taught it to others. To his students, he brought a world of genteel scholarship and quiet contemplation; a world whose modus operandi -- by hand, with ink, on paper, parchment and vellum -- was little changed for centuries; a world of classical music (an accomplished singer, he liked to ply his calligraphy to Beethoven), Gregorian chant and the Latin Mass, which he continued celebrating in discreet defiance long after Vatican II. Into that world burst a young college dropout named Steve Jobs. It is a coincidence no less exquisite than Father Palladino's finest calligraphy that ''Silicon Valley's future most famous screamer studied with a monk who spent years taking a vow of silence,'' as The Hollywood Reporter wrote shortly after Mr. Jobs's death in 2011. A character based on Father Palladino, played by the strapping young actor William Mapother, appears in ''Jobs,'' the 2013 Hollywood film starring Ashton Kutcher. To reporters who asked Father Palladino whether he planned to see the film, he replied, characteristically, that he saw few movies of any kind. An authority on the history, structure and aesthetics of scripts from antiquity to the present, Father Palladino taught calligraphy at Reed College in Portland, Ore., from 1969 until his retirement, in 1984. The college's calligraphy program, which flourished from 1938 until Father Palladino's retirement, was widely regarded as the foremost in the country, training many respected artists, typographers and graphic designers. For decades, nearly every sign and poster on campus was the graceful fruit of its labor. Mr. Jobs briefly attended Reed in 1972 before dropping out for economic reasons, but hung around campus for more than a year afterward; during that time, he audited Father Palladino's class. After helping to found Apple in 1976, he often credited the company's elegant onscreen fonts -- and his larger interest in the design of computers as physical objects -- to what he had been taught there. ''I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great,'' Mr. Jobs said in a 2005 commencement address at Stanford. ''It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.'' He continued: ''Ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.'' Asked about his famous charge in a 2013 interview with The Catholic Sentinel, an Oregon publication, Father Palladino recalled, ''He was most pleasant.'' The word ''calligraphy'' is born of Classical Greek [#x201a] (kallos, ''beautiful'') and +[0/00] (grapho, ''write''). Though he was by all accounts too courtly to have said so, it would doubtless have pained Father Palladino -- whom Mr. Jobs consulted on the design of the Mac's Greek letters -- to see the flagrant unloveliness of the only Greek font at this newspaper's disposal. In Father Palladino's hands, however, calligraphy was about far more than mere beautiful letters: It was about the ways those letters can be coaxed to nestle companionably together to make"
