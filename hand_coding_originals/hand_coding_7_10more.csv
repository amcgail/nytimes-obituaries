55608,"Maggie Keswick, 53, Expert on Chinese Gardens","Maggie Keswick, a Scots-born connoisseur of China and its sensuous, mysterious gardens, died on July 8 in London.","Maggie Keswick, a Scots-born connoisseur of China and its sensuous, mysterious gardens, died on July 8 in London. She was 53 and had homes in London, Santa Monica, Calif., and Wellfleet, Mass. The cause was breast cancer, said John Taylor Williams of Palmer & Dodge, the family's legal counsel in Boston. Margaret Keswick Jencks hailed from a family that has lived and done business in China for nearly 140 years. She was born in Cowhill, Scotland, but spent much of her early life in post-revolutionary China. She became known in the United States with the appearance of her book ""The Chinese Garden"" (1978), which was richly embellished by her own photography. ""Miss Keswick's is no ordinary garden tour,"" a reviewer for The New York Times wrote, ""but a first-rate job of intellect, intelligently illustrated."" The book was reissued in paperback by St. Martin's Press in 1986 and remains in print. Miss Keswick's father, Sir John Keswick, was a major trader at the head of the Scottish company Jardine Matheson. He spoke Chinese and became a trusted friend of Zhou Enlai, Mao Zedong's most influential advisor. In 1982, she edited ""The Thistle and the Jade,"" a history of Jardine Matheson on its 150th anniversary. She also contributed to the ""Oxford Garden Companion"" and to books by her husband, Charles Alexander Jencks, a post-modernist architect and professor at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Architecture. For many years she was the chairwoman of the Keswick Foundation, based in Hong Kong. She established the first cancer hospice there and extended the foundation's work to China. Most recently she created a cancer-care center in Edinburgh, where she was undergoing hospital treatment. She was educated at Oxford University, where she studied Middle English, and at the Architectural Association in London. After ""The Chinese Garden"" was published, she lectured widely in the United States. She was also in demand as a garden designer, collaborating with Frank Gehry, the architect, and Claes Oldenburg, the artist. She is survived by her husband; a son, John; a daughter, Lily Clare; two stepsons, Cosmo and Justin Jencks, all of London, and her mother, Clare Lady Keswick of Portrack, Scotland."

30519,"Beverly Brown, 61, Modern-Dance Choreographer","Beverly Brown, a modern-dance choreographer and longtime lead performer with the Erick Hawkins Dance Company, died on May 17 in Kansas City, Mo.","Beverly Brown, a modern-dance choreographer and longtime lead performer with the Erick Hawkins Dance Company, died on May 17 in Kansas City, Mo. She was 61. A longtime resident of Manhattan, Ms. Brown moved to Kansas City two months before her death. The cause was a stroke, her sister, Tracy Brown, said. Born in Effingham, Ill., and reared in Venezuelan oil camps and in Arizona, Ms. Brown graduated from Carlton College in Northfield, Minn., then traveled east to New York City and a 40-year career in dance. She performed with Hawkins from 1967 to 1974. At first she found herself in uncharted territory, as she put it in a 1996 interview. By the mid-1990's, Ms. Brown had been designated a senior repertory consultant to a new young generation of Hawkins dancers. Ms. Brown stood out as a dancer for her blend of serenity, simplicity and quietly gutsy energy, a mix that made her an ideal interpreter of Hawkins's works and that permeated her own choreography. After leaving the company, she formed the Body Voice Theater and then the Beverly Brown Ensemble, where she experimented with dancers' performing not only movement but also the natural sounds that accompanied much of her choreography. Ms. Brown taught dance at institutions like Colorado University at Boulder and the University of California at Santa Cruz. She also composed music for Siddha Yoga meditation communities in New York and Kansas City. In addition to her sister Tracy, of San Francisco, she is survived by her mother, Frances Brown, of Grand Junction, Colo.; a brother, William, of Leawood, Kan.; and another sister, Jesslyn Brown Stevens, of Sioux Falls, S.D."
