Harnett, a businessman and civic watchdog who finished last in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City in 1977, but fueled debate by helping to force the release of a federal investigative report on questionable financial manipulations by city leaders, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Phoenix.","Joel W. Harnett, a businessman and civic watchdog who finished last in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City in 1977, but fueled debate by helping to force the release of a federal investigative report on questionable financial manipulations by city leaders, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Phoenix. He was 80. The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Lila. Mr. Harnett, who resigned as chairman of the City Club of New York, a government watchdog group, to run for office, sued the Securities and Exchange Commission to release a report that the commission contended was not yet finished. After a Manhattan federal judge began looking into the evidence, the commission released the report. It essentially said that Mayor Abraham D. Beame had deceived the public about the city's perilous financial condition while it was selling a record number of securities to unsuspecting investors. The document drew a storm of caustic comment from Mayor Beame's six challengers. The primary campaign ended with Edward I. Koch, then a congressman, winning the Democratic mayoral nomination; Mario M. Cuomo, then lieutenant governor, finishing second, and Mr. Beame third. Mr. Harnett was last in the seven-person race. Mr. Harnett focused on economic issues in his campaign, emphasizing a need to cut taxes to remain competitive with other cities and states. A marketing executive at Look magazine himself, he argued that the city needed to sell itself better. Joel William Harnett was born in Brooklyn and grew up in the Seagate community on Coney Island. He graduated in 1945 from the University of Richmond, in Virginia, majoring in history and earning Phi Beta Kappa honors. He worked for Look for 20 years. As vice president for marketing and sales promotion, he came up with ways of focusing advertising on more affluent areas so makers of luxury goods could reach the rarefied audience they wanted, rather than all of Look's 8 million readers. Mr. Harnett then started his own company, Media Horizons Inc., which owned radio stations and specialized in publishing magazines directed to readers who market and advertise disparate products. They included Home Video, Law Enforcement Communications and Biomedical Communications. While in business, he also addressed civic issues, first as a member of the City Club, then as its chairman. One of his consistent themes was the need for economic efficiency in city government. He also fought against plans for Westway, a superhighway planned along the Hudson River in Manhattan, and the Second Avenue Subway, arguing that both were unnecessary. He joined Jacqueline Onassis and others to fight for landmark status for Grand Central Terminal and criticized the power of municipal labor unions. In 1979, Mr. Harnett and his wife moved to Phoenix, where he became involved in the Valley Citizens League, a nonpartisan civic group. He and his wife started Phoenix Home and Garden, an upscale magazine that featured tips on growing plants in a desert climate. The couple collected art and made large donations to museums. They gave money for galleries at the Phoenix Art Museum and at the Heard Museum in Phoenix. The University of Richmond named its art museum for them. Mr. Harnett wrote and published several of his own books, including the forthcoming ''The Devil's Own Politics: The Explosive Political Rise and Fall of the Evangelical Movement.'' He was a retired major in the Army Reserve. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his brother, Bertram."
6467,"ADELE ASTAIRE, DANCER-COMEDIAN, DIES","Adele Marie Astaire, the pixieish dancer who captivated audiences in New York and London in many musical comedies of the 1920's with her brother and dance partner, Fred, died yesterday in Phoenix at the age of 83.","Adele Marie Astaire, the pixieish dancer who captivated audiences in New York and London in many musical comedies of the 1920's with her brother and dance partner, Fred, died yesterday in Phoenix at the age of 83. Members of the family said she had suffered a stroke on Jan. 6 and never recovered consciousness. Miss Astaire had been beset by illness in recent years, according to, Kingman Douglass Jr. of Chicago, her stepson. ''But she had enormous recuperative powers,'' he said, ''and soon would be up and in Marine-type English telling what she thought of the world.'' Miss Astaire had lived in Phoenix since her second husband, Kingman Douglass, died in 1971. She had spent summers until two years ago in Ireland, at the castle she shared with her first husband, the late Lord Charles Cavendish. Appeared in 'Funny Face' The diminutive, dark-haired comedian starred in 11 musicals with her brother, who is two years her junior. Among the more memorable were ''Funny Face,'' ''Lady, Be Good,'' ''The Band Wagon,'' ''For Goodness' Sake'' - retitled ''Stop Flirting'' in London - and ''Apple Blossoms.'' Miss Astaire left show business in 1932 to become the wife of Lord Cavendish, the second son of the ninth Duke of Devonshire. Their romance was something of an international sensation, as she kept putting off accepting Lord Charles's proposal until she had one final hit show. At the time of their engagement she was performing in Florenz Ziegfeld's ''Smiles,'' which received less than happy reviews when it opened in 1930. Although ''Smiles'' was a dud, reviewers, such as Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times, singled out the Astaires for praise: ''Strictly speaking, the Astaires are dancers. But they have more than one string to their fiddle. With them, dancing is comedy of manners, very much in the current mode. Free of show-shop trickery, they plunge with spirit into the midst of the frolic. Once to the tune of 'If I Were You, Love,' with a squealing German band accompaniment, they give dancing all the mocking grace of improvisation with droll dance inflections and with comic changes of pace. Adele Astaire is also an impish comedian; she can give sad lines a gleam of infectious good-nature. Slender, agile and quickwitted, the Astaires are ideal for the American song-and-dance stage.'' Left Stage and Her Brother After ''The Band Wagon,'' at the pinnacle of her career, she left the stage and her brother for Lismore Castle in County Waterford, Ireland, from which producers tried repeatedly to lure her. Mr. Astaire went on to greater fame on the screen with Ginger Rogers. Fred said of his sister on her retirement, ''She was a great artist and inimitable, and the grandest sister anybody could have.'' He had followed her into dancing. When he was 4 and she was 6, their parents sent him to her dance classes so he could keep her company, but he got interested. The marriage of Lord and Lady Charles, though happy, was marked by tragedy. A daughter was born in 1933, and died the same day. Two years later, twin sons, who were born prematurely, died within hours of their births. She was to have no more children. Some time later, Lord Charles fell ill from a liver ailment that made him an invalid. During World War II, at the urging of her husband, Miss Astaire worked at a famous Red Cross canteen in London, the Rainbow Corner, helping out at the information desk, dancing with G.I.'s and shopping and writing letters for them. To the letters she signed herself, ''Adele Astaire (Fred's sister).'' Married for Second Time On March 23, 1944, Lord Charles died. Three years later, on April 28, 1947, Miss Astaire was married to Mr. Douglass, whom she had met at the Rainbow Corner. It was his second marriage. In 1950, he became assistant director of the Central Intelligence Agency, a post he held for two years before resuming his career in finance. He became a partner in Dillon Read & Company, retiring before his death in New York in 1971. Adele Marie Austerlitz was born in Omaha, Neb., on Sept. 10, 1898, to Fredrick Austerlitz, a brewer from Vienna, and the former Ann Geilus, a native of Omaha. In 1904, the family moved to New York, where Adele and Fred, the only children, were enrolled in the Alviene School of Dance. Until then, they had been tutored by their mother. The Astaires appeared in their first vaudeville show in New York in 1912, and had their first triumph on Broadway in 1917, with ''Over the Top'' at the Winter Garden. Besides her brother and stepson, Miss Astaire is survived by two other stepsons, Howard James Douglass of Chicago and William Angus Douglass of London. Private services will be held in Phoenix and Beverly Hills, Calif."
39414,"Elaine Lustig Cohen, Modernist Designer, Dies at 89","Elaine Lustig Cohen, whose prolific graphic design career began -- almost accidentally -- with signage for the celebrated Seagram Building in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan.","Elaine Lustig Cohen, whose prolific graphic design career began -- almost accidentally -- with signage for the celebrated Seagram Building in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89. Her death was confirmed by her daughter and only immediate survivor, the graphic artist Tamar Cohen. A photography column in The New York Times in 1997, on the occasion of an exhibition of her photocollages at a SoHo gallery, summed up Ms. Cohen as having ''the soul of a Bauhaus devotee'' and ''the eye of a Constructivist.'' Steven Heller, her co-author on ''Born Modern,'' a biography of her first husband, the design pioneer Alvin Lustig, described her as ''the quintessential Modernist,'' happy to talk about the past but ''always in the present.'' Ms. Cohen's graphic design career really began just after her first husband, 12 years her senior, died of complications of diabetes in 1955, at 40. She liked to describe her job with him in New York as ''office slave,'' preparing mechanicals and making type specifications. But others may have seen her as his partner. Shortly after Mr. Lustig died, the star architect Philip Johnson called his widow to ask when the first stage of the Seagram's signage project, assigned to Mr. Lustig, would be ready. ''I had never designed anything on my own in my life, but I did every piece,'' she told ArtForum 60 years later. ''The 375 address outside, the Brasserie sign, fire hose connections, switches, even things that wouldn't be seen.'' The building opened in 1958 and was immediately hailed as a minimalist architectural masterpiece. Her clients in the years ahead included the Jewish Museum, General Motors, the Museum of Primitive Art, the Federal Aviation Administration, Rio de Janeiro's Museum of Modern Art and the 1964 World's Fair. She designed museum catalogs and furniture. As a book-cover designer, she followed in Mr. Lustig's precisionist footsteps but eventually established her own, more free-form style. ''I tried to reflect the spirit of the books,'' she said in a video made by AIGA, the graphic arts organization, when she was awarded its medal in 2012. Her jacket for ''Yvor Winters On Modern Poets'' looked as if plastic letters had been placed on a tabletop, then jostled by a passing child. A book about St. Augustine featured his name twice, as the arms of a cross. The jacket for Tennessee Williams's short-story collection ''Hard Candy'' showed extreme close-ups of cellophane-wrapped sweets, seeming to fall through the air. She then turned to making art. Writing in The Times about a 57th Street gallery show of hers in 1976, the critic John Russell praised the subtlety of the colors in her paintings. In 1979, she was the first woman to have a solo show at the trendy Mary Boone Gallery downtown. Last year, 10 of her paintings were shown at the underground gallery of Philip Johnson's Glass House in New Canaan, Conn., leading a reviewer for Art in America to comment on their blend of art and design: ''They hold the room but do not resolve it as design would. They upend space and continue to intrigue.'' But her earlier work also ended up in museums. A Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum exhibition in 1995 displayed more than 80 of her book covers and institutional graphics. She loved combining type and images and had an affection for 20th-century avant-garde typography. When she was 80, she was creating alphabets in the computer graphics app Adobe Illustrator. Elaine Firstenberg was born on March 6, 1927, in Jersey City, the daughter of Herman Firstenberg, a plumber, and the former Elizabeth Loeb. She was given art lessons but traced her passion for art and design to the day, when she was 15, that she walked into Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century gallery, which had opened on 57th Street that year. Ms. Firstenberg studied art at Sophie Newcomb College, part of Tulane University, in New Orleans. After two years, believing her only art-career option as a woman was teaching, she transferred to the University of Southern California to major in art education. She received a bachelor's degree in 1948. She signed on as a summer intern at the new Modern Institute of Art in Los Angeles and, at the opening, met Mr. Lustig. They were married the same year. The new bride taught junior high school but quit after one year. It was ''an awful experience,'' she told the online magazine Bomb in 2013. ''I was too young to be teaching 14-years-olds.'' It seemed natural to go to work in her husband's office. (Her mother had done the same, acting as bookkeeper for her husband's plumbing business.) No one seemed surprised that Mr. Lustig did not plan to teach his young wife graphic design, using her instead as ''an all-purpose secretary, production assistant and draftsperson,'' as a 1995 article in Eye magazine said. She herself summed up the situation philosophically, as quoted by Mr. Heller: ''It was, after all, a different time.'' The newlyweds worked briefly in Los Angeles, then moved to New York when Mr. Lustig was invited to create a design program at Yale. They were still in New York when he died, seven years after they were married. Arthur A. Cohen, an author and the founder of Noonday Press and Meridian Books, was a client and close friend of the Lustigs. After Alvin Lustig's death, Ms. Lustig and Mr. Cohen continued to work together; they were married in 1956 and had a daughter. In 1973 the couple founded Ex Libris, which sold antiquarian books and periodicals on the ground floor of their East 70th Street townhouse. But her new career had taken hold; when Mr. Cohen died in 1986, his obituary identified her as ''the painter Elaine Lustig Cohen.'' In the end, though, she told a writer for Artforum last year, her design and art sensibility, her sense of abstraction, ''came from architecture.'' ''When I was doing graphic design in the postwar period, architecture was going to save the world,'' she recalled. ''We were all going to be good in life because of the space we lived it in.''"

She was 78 and lived in Culver City. As the innocent young woman in the mysterious Scottish town that comes back to life one day in every 100 years, Ms. Bell captivated critics as well as theatergoers. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson was so taken with the show as ""a singing pattern of enchantment"" that he hesitated to write about individual performers. He did say, however, that ""Almost Like Being in Love"" was ""sung rapturously"" by David Brooks and Ms. Bell. The musical historian Miles Kreuger, who saw the show in its premiere engagement and later became a friend of Ms. Bell's, said this week that as Fiona ""she had the most wondrous, doe-like, ethereal quality."" For her role in ""Brigadoon,"" she won many awards, including the Donaldson Award for best debut performance by an actress in a musical. Subsequently she made record albums for RCA Victor, including the original cast album of ""Brigadoon."" It was to be her only New York musical. She was born in St. Louis. By the age of 8, she was singing on radio. After the family moved to California, the director Robert Z. Leonard heard her singing at a party and was instrumental in having her signed by Metro Goldwyn Mayer. She appeared with the Marx Brothers in ""A Night at the Opera."" She studied voice both in Rome and in California and later sang a duet with the Metropolitan Opera tenor James Melton in the movie, ""Ziegfeld Follies."" Mr. Lerner and Mr. Loewe apparently wanted her to play a role in their musical, ""The Day Before Spring,"" but MGM held her to her contract. Several years later, she auditioned for ""Brigadoon,"" and acted in the show for a year. She married Mr. Lerner in 1947 and they were divorced two years later. Ms. Bell was the second of his eight wives. In 1948, she was in the world premiere of Kurt Weill and Arnold Sundgaard's folk opera, ""Down in the Valley,"" at Indiana University and repeated her role on television. Later she sang at the St. Louis Municipal Opera, the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera and the Sacramento Music Circus. In recent years she taught voice in Culver City. She is survived by a son, Tom Charlesworth of Portland, Ore., and two sisters, Evelyn Lewis of Hawaii and Veronica McKinley of New Castle, Pa."

49049,"Emory Bellard, Creator of Wishbone Offense, Dies at 83","Emory Bellard, the coach who was credited with introducing the wishbone formation to college football, providing the framework for many of the great running teams of the 1970s, died Thursday in Georgetown, Tex.","Emory Bellard, the coach who was credited with introducing the wishbone formation to college football, providing the framework for many of the great running teams of the 1970s, died Thursday in Georgetown, Tex. He was 83. His wife, Susan, said the cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Bellard (pronounced bell-ARD) spent 14 seasons as a head coach, first at Texas A&M and then at Mississippi State, but his signature contribution to football came in 1968 as an assistant at the University of Texas. The Texas team had suffered through three subpar seasons, and the coach, Darrell Royal, seeking a change, asked Bellard to devise an offensive backfield scheme that would include a lead blocker and maximize the effectiveness of the team's three strong running backs. Bellard came up with a variant of a two-back formation called the veer: the quarterback and the three runners lined up in the shape of a Y, or a wishbone, the fullback right behind the quarterback and two tailbacks split behind them. From this formation, the quarterback had three options: he could hand the ball to the fullback charging up the middle, or he could fake to the fullback and sprint out to one side or the other, then turn upfield with the ball himself or, if the defense closed in on him, pitch the ball wide to a tailback. The other tailback would cut inside as a blocker. The various options gave the offense the potential advantage of faking out would-be tacklers without having to block them, and it could help smaller, faster teams overcome bigger, stronger opponents. Texas tied its first game using the wishbone and lost its second, but it then won 30 games in a row, capturing the national championship in 1969 and sharing it with Nebraska in 1970. Soon, other teams, including powerhouses like Alabama and Oklahoma, began using the wishbone offense, also known as the triple-option. Many colleges began to tailor their high school recruiting to find shifty, shrewd quarterbacks who could run the triple-option offense and speedy runners who could thrive in it. It was many years before defenses caught up with the wishbone. From 1969 through 1979, seven national championships were won or shared by wishbone teams. Bellard was hired away from Texas by Texas A&M, and between 1972 and 1978 he led the Aggies to two 10-win seasons and three bowl games. He then coached seven years at Mississippi State, twice finishing in the top 20 in the polls. His overall record as a head coach was 85-69. Emory Dilworth Bellard was born on Dec. 17, 1927, in Luling, Tex., east of San Antonio, where his father worked in the oilfields and was killed in an accident when Emory was 12. He was a freshman running back at Texas at the end of World War II. But after he was hurt and players returned to school from the war, he transferred to Southwest Texas State (now Texas State), where he earned a degree. He started coaching high school in 1949, and his teams won three state titles before he was hired by Royal after the 1966 season. Bellard's first wife died of cancer. In addition to his wife, Susan, whom he married in 1994, he is survived by a son, Bob, a high school coach in Bryan, Tex., and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Bellard may have invented the wishbone, but he didn't name it. According to Royal, it was a newspaper writer, Mickey Herskowitz, who gets credit for that. In the 2005 book ''Coach Royal: Conversations With a Texas Football Legend,'' he recalled that after a game or two, he was asked at a news conference what the new formation was called. It didn't have a name, he replied. ''I said: 'Well, they're kind of in the shape of a Y back there. Call it the Y.' I mean, I didn't care what they called it, you know. Mickey Herskowitz said: 'That's not very original. Why don't you call it a wishbone? It's in the shape of a wishbone.' I said: 'You got it, Mickey. It's a wishbone.'''"
20801,"CHARLES S. DRAPER, ENGINEER; GUIDED ASTRONAUTS TO MOON","Charles Stark Draper, a pioneer in advanced guidance technology for aircraft and missiles and developer of the navigation system that steered Americans to the moon and back, died Saturday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass.","Charles Stark Draper, a pioneer in advanced guidance technology for aircraft and missiles and developer of the navigation system that steered Americans to the moon and back, died Saturday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 85 years old. Described by his peers as one of the foremost engineers of our time, Dr. Draper was a longtime professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He founded M.I.T.'s Instrumentation Laboratory to develop his inventions applying gyroscopic principles for World War II gunsights and for the guidance systems that made possible intercontinental ballistic missiles. Howard W. Johnson, a former chairman of the M.I.T. Corporation, said, ''His research created a whole new industry in intertial instruments and systems for airplanes, ships, submarines, missiles, satellites and space vehicles.'' 'In the Category of Genius' Inertial guidance is based on the familiar principle that keeps a child's gyroscopic top from falling: a rapidly spinning wheel will resist forces working to twist it from the plane in which it is revolving. For his guidance systems Dr. Draper used three spinning gyros, each responsive to only one direction of motion - up and down, right and left and rolling. These gyros formed a basis for a self-contained system that remembers an object's course of flight and can measure changes in that course. The system devised by Dr. Draper for the moonbound Apollo spacecraft included telescopes, a sextant and a computerized inertial guidance device that told the astronauts where they were in space, where they were headed and how fast. Such data were used to direct all the spacecraft's propulsion systems. James Killian Jr., a former M.I.T. president, described Dr. Draper as a ''great teacher as well as an engineer whose technological achievements clearly placed him in the category of genius.'' Doc Draper, as he was usually called, became a legend on the M.I.T. campus almost from the day he arrived there as a student in 1922. A stocky man with a fighter's broken nose and a scrappy temperament to match, he was the kind of student who took professors on terrifying airplane rides to prove some point of aerodynamics. As a professor himself, he was a compulsive and creative tinkerer. Gunsight for the Navy He was born Oct. 2, 1901, in the small town of Windsor, Mo. After two years at the University of Missouri, he transferred to Stanford University and earned a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1922, intending to become a physician. But on a trip East he visited the M.I.T. campus in Cambridge, became fascinated with work in aeronautical engineering and decided to enroll. He learned to fly an open-cockpit biplane, earned another bachelor's degree and then a doctorate in physics in 1938. The following year, Dr. Draper became a full professor at M.I.T. and founded the Instrumentation Laboratory. The group's first major achievement was the Mark 14 gyroscopic gunsight for the Navy, which made it possible for antiaircraft guns to take deadly accurate aim on attacking aircraft even while a ship was rolling and tossing. Out of this research came the guidance systems for jet fighter planes and the Polaris, Poseidon and Trident submarines and missiles as well as key components for the Atlas and Titan rockets. Dr. Draper's laboratory was chosen in 1961 to develop the Apollo guidance and navigation system. As Dr. Draper recalled in an interview several months before the first moon landing in 1969, James E. Webb, the space agency administrator, told him: '' 'Stark, this is going to be a hell of a job. Can it be done?' I said yes. We used to give lunar navigation problems as thesis work for our students, and I knew it could be done. 'It'll be ready before you need it,' I told Webb - and, I might add, it is.'' Caught in Campus Protests A few months after the moon landing, Dr. Draper was forced to step down as director of the Instrumentation Laboratory. He was caught in the middle of widespread protests against military work being done on university campuses. He insisted that any organization has an obligation to society to provide ''services which fall within its special competence,'' adding: ''That includes defense work. If defense is neglected, all is lost.'' In 1973, the laboratory became independent of M.I.T. and was renamed the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory. Dr. Draper was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1965. He was an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and the International Space Hall of Fame. Survivors include his wife, the former Ivy Hurd Willard; three sons, James and Michael of Newton, Mass., and John of Hampton Falls, N.H.; a daughter, Martha Draper Ditmeyer of Fairway, Kan., and six grandchildren. Funeral services will be private."

He was 81 years old and lived in New Hope, Pa. Among the more than 90 shows that made the transition from the composer's melodies to full-blown orchestral instrumentation under Mr. Walker's ministrations were ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Call Me Madam,'' ''Damn Yankees,'' ''Shenandoah,'' ''Silk Stockings,'' ''What Makes Sammy Run,'' ''By Jupiter,'' ''Finian's Rainbow,'' ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' ''Most Happy Fella,'' and ''The Music Man.'' Mr. Walker was regarded as a versatile arranger who studied Greek instruments to attain the proper atmosphere for ''Zorba'' and who could also find exactly the right Viennese ambience for ''She Loves Me.'' In a review of ''Greenwillow,'' a 1960 musical with a score by Frank Loesser, Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote, ''Note that the overture, orchestrated by Don Walker, does not blast you out of your seat with a crash of sound; it invites you to enjoy a humorous fairy story. In every respect, including the singing, the music is characterized by taste.'' Earned Nonstop Royalties According to his agent, Brett Adams, Mr. Walker was one of the first arrangers who earned a continuous royalty from the shows he worked on. In addition to his theater work, Mr. Walker was a leading arranger for the popular band Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians, and at one time served as conductor for the television show ''Your Hit Parade.'' He was also a composer and lyricist in his own right. In 1945 he adapted Gilbert and Sullivan's ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' into a musical called ''Memphis Bound,'' which starred Bill Robinson and an all-black cast. Mr. Walker was born in Lambertville, N.J. He attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and began his professional musical career by orchestrating operettas. He is survived by his wife, Audrey; a daughter, Anne Liebgold, and a son, David, all of New Hope."

Roth, who was one of the most talented bridge players of all time, winning 26 national championships with 11 different partners, died yesterday in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 92. Mr. Roth died of natural causes, his family said. Born in the Bronx in 1914, Mr. Roth was an honor student in mathematics at Stuyvesant High School, and he graduated from City College. Afterward, he worked as a statistician for the government in Washington. He was in the Army in World War II, fighting a little and playing bridge a lot. A future bridge partner, Tobias Stone, helped secure a game with Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Afterward, Mr. Roth and Mr. Stone were returned to the front. After the war, Mr. Roth moved back to New York City and was working full time in bridge. But he went to Miami Beach for a tournament and fell in love with the city. He called his wife, the former Fay Edelstein, whom he married in 1940, and told her to pack up and join him. Mr. Roth opened a bridge club in Miami and ran it for about five years. Then the couple moved to Washington to work with Charles Goren, founding the Charles Goren School of Bridge. After 10 years, Mr. Roth returned to New York and bought the Mayfair Club, a private card club, which he managed until retiring to Boca Raton in 1995. Mr. Roth's most famous partnership was with Mr. Stone. They bid using their Roth-Stone system, many aspects of which have been adopted by present-day tournament players, like five-card majors, a one-no-trump response to a one-heart or one-spade opening that is forcing for one round, and negative doubles. An innovative theoretician, Mr. Roth also conceived the Unusual No-Trump. Mr. Roth played in three Bermuda Bowl world team championships, in 1955, 1958 and 1967, each time winning a silver medal. He was also second in the 1968 World Team Olympiad. During the 1955 Bermuda Bowl, Mr. Roth was declaring a two-spade contract and felt he had played the deal before -- but as a defender. He called over the chief tournament director, Al Sobel, who did not believe Mr. Roth because the cards had been dealt at the table. Mr. Sobel made Mr. Roth call out all of the cards in each hand -- including the spot-cards -- before he threw out the board. No one ever discovered how the duplicate deal happened. Mr. Roth wrote ''Al Roth on Bridge: The Roth-Stone System'' (1953) and ''Picture Bidding'' (1991), and was co-author of ''Bridge Is a Partnership Game'' (1958), ''Modern Bridge Bidding Complete'' (1968) and ''Bridge for Beginners'' (1970). Mr. Roth was a grand life master of the American Contract Bridge League with 12,604.36 master points and a world life master of the World Bridge Federation. He was inducted into the American Contract Bridge League Hall of Fame in 1995. He and his wife, who died in 1995, were divorced in 1963. They had a son, Mel, who survives them. . Mr. Roth is also survived by his second wife, Jean Farrell, whom he married in 1980; three grandsons; and two great-grandsons. Mr. Roth was on magazine bidding panels, most notably for The Bridge World for more than 50 years, where he was famous for saying what he would call and explaining his choice with, ''What's the problem?'' But one time in a tournament Mr. Roth did misbid a hand. He was teased unmercifully by fellow experts and finally lashed back with, ''Well, Babe Ruth struck out, too.'' Afterward, he was known as Babe Roth."

He was 86. Mr. Cadbury worked in his family's chocolate-manufacturing company, Cadbury Brothers, and was president of the Royal Society for Nature Conservation from 1962 to 1988. In that post, he worked to establish trusts to promote wildlife conservation in individual British counties. By the mid-1960's, The Daily Telegraph reported, such trusts embraced ""the whole of Britain."" He also personally bought a number of pieces of land that he turned over to conservation groups to be administered as nature preserves. These purchases included, in 1973, the mile-long Aride Island in the Indian Ocean. Another British newspaper, The Independent, reported last week that Aride is home to ""a million breeding sea birds and the sweet-scented Wright's gardenia that is found nowhere else in the world."" Mr. Cadbury had three sons and two daughters by his marriages to the former Honor Milward, who died in 1957, and the former Betty Hone, who died in 1991."
45655,"Ivan Karp, Pop Art Dealer, Dies at 86","Ivan Karp, a cigar-chomping, fast-talking New York gallery owner who helped find, popularize and market a the Pop artists of the 1960s, including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg, died on Thursday at his home in Charlotteville, N.Y.","Ivan Karp, a cigar-chomping, fast-talking New York gallery owner who helped find, popularize and market a the Pop artists of the 1960s, including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg, died on Thursday at his home in Charlotteville, N.Y. He was 86. His wife, Marilynn, said he died of natural causes. Mr. Karp always found the time to look at the slides of dozens of aspiring artists who each week asked him for the chance of a lifetime. He responded with precious gallery space, encouragement, a referral to a more appropriate dealer or rejection. As Pop blossomed, Mr. Karp took to the road and made hundreds of speeches promoting the new art form -- not to mention appearances on television shows like ''The Tonight Show.'' In 1969, Mr. Karp was one of the first gallery owners to follow artists to SoHo, an industrial area that would quickly become as much an art gallery district as the Upper East Side. His O K Harris Works of Art -- first at 485 West Broadway, then at its present address, 383 West Broadway -- would become the first gallery on one of SoHo's principal boulevards. He, like several other pioneers to venture south of Houston Street, liked to think of himself as SoHo's unofficial mayor. As driven as he was to find the new, Mr. Karp also gained fame for foraging through demolished buildings for architectural artifacts and remnants, thousands of which were donated to museums by a society he founded. He and his wife collected all manner of odd things -- from washboards to misspelled restaurant menus to hatbox papers. A recent passion was to restore old country burial grounds. But his life's mission was to help find and guide the careers of major 20th century artists, among them Claes Oldenburg, Tom Wesselmann and John Chamberlain in addition to Warhol, Lichtenstein and Rauschenberg. He became an early champion of photorealism, the genre that arose in the late 1960s in which painters strive for a photographic effect. He worked at the search. The New York Times Magazine in 1966 quoted an unnamed art expert as saying, ''He knows as much as, if not more than, anybody else about what's going on in the hidden corners of the art world.'' Once he found a potential genius, Mr. Karp's would do everything he could to help the artist achieve rewards commensurate with his talents. Citing van Gogh's fame, which came only at the end of his life and after his death, Mr. Karp vowed, ''No genius should go undiscovered.'' He never claimed this commitment was altruistic. In 1968, The Times called him ''New York's deftest and most enthusiastic salesman of the new art.'' Ivan Karp was born on June 4, 1926, in the Bronx. His father, a hat salesman, soon moved the family to Brooklyn. Mr. Karp dropped out of Erasmus Hall High School to join the Army Air Forces in 1944. He recalled taking the middle name Conrad when he was standing in line to enlist. He noticed that men without middle names were marked ''no M.I.,'' for middle initial and thought it looked dreadful. He was carrying ''Heart of Darkness'' by Joseph Conrad at the time. Mr. Karp attended The New School for Social Research on the G. I. Bill and was one of the first arts critics for The Village Voice in the mid-1950s. He also published short stories. At some point he sold Good Humor ice cream and tried to organize a union for the company's workers. At another, he was employed by movie companies in New York to edit romantic scenes out of Westerns in the belief that fans liked only galloping and guns. In 1958, he became an art dealer at the Martha Jackson Gallery. The next year, he moved to the Leo Castelli Gallery to be associate director. There, the loud, affable Mr. Karp became an excellent counterpoint to Mr. Castelli, a soft-spoken sophisticate who helped win international acceptance of postwar modern art. Marilynn Gelfman, a sculptor, came into the gallery in 1964 with a friend's paintings that other dealers had found too unorthodox. ''He said he liked my friend's work, but he loved me,'' she said. They married later that year. In addition to his wife, Mr. Karp is survived by his sons, Ethan and Jesse; his daughter, Amie Karp; his sister, Rhoda Ben-Isaac; and two granddaughters. In 1967, Mr. Karp published a comic novel, ''Doobie Doo,'' about love between Pop artists. The next year, he yearned to start his own gallery at the ''outposts of civilization'' and headed for SoHo. He named the enterprise -- big enough to hold five one-man shows at once -- O K Harris because it was ''a tough, American name that sounded like that of a riverboat gambler.'' As president of the Anonymous Arts Recovery Society, Mr. Karp trundled about New York in a beat-up Jeep looking for gargoyles, capitals and cornices from buildings that had been torn down. A particular delight was finding carved portraits that Italian immigrant stone craftsmen had made of one another -- warts, missing teeth and all. Mr. Karp, a self-described ''rubble-rouser,'' accomplished his preservation mission the old-fashioned way: with bribes. ''For anywhere between $5 to $25, they'll take the trouble not to smash something,'' he said."
1545,Ferdinand Brickwedde Dies at 86; First to Measure Heavy Hydrogen,"Ferdinand Brickwedde, a physicist who in 1931 produced the first measurable amounts of deuterium, or heavy hydrogen, died Wednesday at a nursing home in Bellefont, Pa.","Ferdinand Brickwedde, a physicist who in 1931 produced the first measurable amounts of deuterium, or heavy hydrogen, died Wednesday at a nursing home in Bellefont, Pa. He was 86 years old. The cause of death had not been determined yesterday. The chief credit for the 1931 discovery went to Harold C. Urey of Columbia University, leader of the three-member research team, and he won a Nobel Prize in 1935. The third member was George M. Murphy of Columbia. The deuterium was produced in a low-temperature laboratory at the National Bureau of Standards. The team discovered an atom whose nucleus was roughly twice the weight of one atom of hydrogen. It was assumed that the atom contained two protons instead of one. This dismayed physicists: The atom would then have two positive electrical charges, even though, like all other hydrogen atoms, it behaved chemically as though it had a single charge. Many Uses for Discovery Also in 1931, in England, James Chadwick discovered a particle, the neutron, similar to the proton but with no electric charge. It was ultimately realized that deuterium contained one proton and one neutron. It was to have many uses - making heavy waterfor nuclear reactors and as fuel in a hydrogen bomb or fusion power generator. Ferdinand Graft Brickwedde, born in Baltimore, was educated in Baltimore public schools and at Johns Hopkins University, where he earned his doctorate at the age of 22. He was named chief of the low-temperature laboratory of the Bureau of Standards in 1926. He directed its heat and power division from 1946 to 1956 and established its cryogenic engineering laboratory in Boulder, Colo. For seven years, beginning in 1956, Dr. Brickwedde was dean of the College of Chemistry and Physics at Pennsylvania State University. He retired as a professor of physics in 1968. Dr. Brickwedde is survived by his wife, Langhorne Howard Brickwedde of Bellefont; two daughters, Langhorne Virginia Brickwedde of Arlington, Va., and Ruth B. Cooper of Linwood, N.J., and a sister, Catherine Wilson of Baltimore."
46311,"Arthur Knapp Jr., 85, Champion In International Yacht Racing","Arthur Knapp Jr., a yachtsman whose lifelong passion for the sport ranged from the America's Cup races of the 1930's to frostbite sailing on Long Island Sound, died on Monday at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital.","Arthur Knapp Jr., a yachtsman whose lifelong passion for the sport ranged from the America's Cup races of the 1930's to frostbite sailing on Long Island Sound, died on Monday at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. He was 85 years old and lived in Larchmont, N.Y. He died of leukemia after a long illness, according to his daughter, Corliss Engle. Mr. Knapp was born in Bayside, Queens, where he began sailing when he was 6 years old. In 1916, his father, Arthur Knapp Sr., bought him his first boat -- a 12-foot Butterfly Class dinghy -- for $20. Two years later, the young Knapp moved up to a bigger craft, a 22-foot Star Class keelboat. The Star boat was the beginning of what Mr. Knapp once described as his extended ""love affair"" with the class. He won the Star Class world championship as a crew member in 1924 and as a skipper in 1930. Mr. Knapp graduated from Princeton University, where in 1928 he was victorious in the university's first intercollegiate regatta, against Yale and Harvard. That same year, he began work at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was a stock broker until his retirement in 1974. From 1976 to 1981, he was a senior consultant for Ratsey & Lapthorn, a British sailmaking firm. Throughout his career, Mr. Knapp made yachting his avocation. In 1924, he won the Sears Cup, the junior national sailing championship. His interest in sailing was year-round. In 1932, he and a group of sailors from the Long Island Sound area formed the Frostbite Yacht Club, a stalwart group that began racing small, interclub dinghies during the winter months. From 1946 to 1966, he won the annual Larchmont Yacht Club's frostbite series 14 times. Mr. Knapp retired from frostbiting in 1966 because of severe arthritis in his legs. ""I wanted to quit while I was ahead,"" he once said. In 1983, he wrote: ""I sit on the founders' porch of the Larchmont Yacht Club in the winter, mostly every Sunday, watching my beloved dinghy fleet out there freezing to death and wishing that my arthritis would go away and let me join them."" In 1937, Mr. Knapp crewed as a sailtrimmer aboard Harold S. (Mike) Vanderbilt's J-boat Ranger in the America's Cup race series. Ranger beat Endeavour II, Britain's challenger, 4-0. Mr. Knapp was the author of ""Race Your Boat Right."" (Van Nostrand, 1952). Mr. Knapp is survived by his daughter, Mrs. Engle of Brookline, Mass., and two grandsons."

He was 69 years old. Mr. Foreman left Hollywood for London after he appeared in 1951 before the House Committee on Un-American Activities and was named as an ''uncooperative witness'' and was blacklisted. He did not originally claim credit for the Academy Award-winning screenplay of the 1957 film ''The Bridge on the River Kwai,'' written with Michael Wilson. But the script included Mr. Foreman's ''trademark'' - characters named Baker, Grogan and Weaver. At the time, the screenwriting credit and the Academy Award were given to Pierre Boulle, author of the novel. The Writers Guild of America and the Motion Picture Academy are now considering changing the official film credit, a spokesman for the Writers Guild said yesterday. Mr. Foreman's script for ''High Noon'' was nominated for an Academy Award, as were his scripts for ''Champion,'' ''The Men,'' ''The Guns of Navarone'' and ''Young Winston.'' Both the American and British screenwriters' guilds gave Mr. Foreman their Laurel Award for lifetime achievement. Before and after he left Hollywood, Mr. Foreman was involved with films based on social issues. He directed the antiwar film ''The Victors'' in 1963, and wrote scripts for ''Home of the Brave,'' about racial prejudice, and ''The Men,'' about disabled veterans. Wrote for Stanley Kramer Mr. Foreman was born in Chicago, and studied at the University of Illinois, Northwestern and the John J. Marshall Law School. He dropped out of law school and - after working as a newspaper reporter, fiction writer, press agent, play director and carnival barker - moved to Hollywood in 1938. There, he worked as a reader, or story analyst, for several studios and as a film laboratory technician, while continuing to write. After he won a prize for a scenario in a contest sponsored by the California Medical Association, he received his first studio assignment, collaborating on low-budget Bowery Boys films, but his career was interrupted by World War II. He served in the Army Signal Corps and was assigned to a unit that made orientation and training films, run by the director Frank Capra. After the war, Mr. Foreman began writing films for the producer-director Stanley Kramer, including ''Home of the Brave,'' ''Champion,'' ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' and two films that won the Hollywood Screenwriters Guild Award, ''The Men'' and ''High Noon.'' He also co-wrote the script for the 1950 film ''Young Man With a Horn.'' Mr. Foreman became a partner in Screenplays Inc. - an early independent film company that became the Kramer Company - but resigned from it in 1951, after his appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He started his own production company, but public pressure forced such investors as Gary Cooper to withdraw their support. After he successfully sued the State Department for a passport, which had been denied him because of the blacklisting, Mr. Foreman moved to London. He lived there until 1975, although he retained his United States citizenship. Produced 'Born Free' Mr. Foreman worked on British films until 1957, when ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' appeared. In August 1956, at his request, he came to the United States and testified in executive session before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, but refused to become an informant. He then returned to Britain and started Highroad Productions in London, through which he wrote and produced movies for Columbia Pictures. Mr. Foreman wrote and produced ''The Key'' (1958) and ''The Guns of Navarone'' (1961), and wrote, produced and directed ''The Victors'' in 1963. He produced the hugely sucessful film ''Born Free'' in 1965, as well as ''MacKenna's Gold'' and ''The Virgin Soldiers'' in 1969. In 1972 he wrote and produced ''Young Winston,'' which was directed by Richard Attenborough. Head of British Writers Guild During his years in Britain, Mr. Foreman was elected to the executive council of the British Film Production Association, was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and was appointed a governor of the British Film Institute, the British National Film School and the Cinematographic Film Council. He was president for seven years of the Writers Guild of Great Britain, and in 1970, he was awarded the title of Commander of the British Empire. After he returned to the United States, Mr. Foreman served on the advisory board of the American Film Institute, on the public-media panel of the National Endowment for the Arts, and on the executive board of the Writers Guild of America. He was also a member of the board of directors of the Center Theater Group in Los Angeles. During the 1970's, Mr. Foreman wrote and prepared films and television programs for MCA-Universal, and in the early 1980's he wrote and produced films for Warner Bros. His final project was to write the screenplay for and co-produce ''The Yellow Jersey,'' a forthcoming film, featuring Dustin Hoffman, about the Tour de France bicycle race. He is survived by his wife, Evelyn; three children, Kate Lovenheim, Jonathan Foreman and Amanda Foreman; his mother, Fannie, and a sister, Sherry Sobell. Memorial services will he held tomorrow at 2 P.M. at the Mount Sinai Mortuary in Burbank, Calif."

Mr. Brown wrote it with Tony Sansone and Bob Calilli. It was inspired by Mr. Brown's crush on the girlfriend of a bandmate. With Steve Martin, also known as Steve Martin Caro, as the lead singer, the song was ranked No. 222 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest songs of all time. It was also a hit for the Four Tops in 1968. Born Michael Lookofsky on April 25, 1949, Mr. Brown grew up in Brooklyn and studied classical music. His father, Harry, was a studio violinist and owned a recording studio; he also managed the Left Banke and produced some of its songs. Mr. Brown left the group in 1967.

Weiner, who catered to scholarly bibliophiles as purveyor of sometimes rare, generally out of print and often dusty books at his Academy Bookstore on West 18th Street, took his life on Aug. 2 at the Gramercy Park Hotel. He was 53 and lived in Manhattan. His sister, Linda Rosenfeld, said her brother, who had a history of depression, took a room on an upper floor and jumped out of a window. A native of Boston who grew up in Auburn, Me., Mr. Weiner, whose father operated a paperback-book store, graduated from Boston University and received a master's degree in psychology at Farleigh Dickinson. After a frustrating decade as a New York City social worker, it dawned on him that if his clients' major social and psychological needs couldn't be filled by books, his certainly could be. In 1977 he opened the Academy at 10 West 18th Street and found himself in the vanguard of an antiquarian trend. Within a decade, West 18th Street had replaced Fourth Avenue's Book Row to become the center of a new old-book district. Catering to laid-back, serious-minded readers with stock that ranged from the academic to the arts, Mr. Weiner added classical records, which proved so popular that he opened a record annex next door earlier this year. For all his customers' low key, scholarly demeanor, Mr. Weiner could start a stampede simply by leaving out shopping bags filled with samples of, say, 2,000 newly acquired philosophy books from a Columbia professor's library. Regulars, who saw the Academy as a club, were attracted in part by the personal service, something of a necessity in a store with display space for only a fraction of its stock and a problematic, hunt-and-pick classification system. If the store, with its jumbled bare metal shelves and dusty air, had a ramshackle feeling, that was exactly what Mr. Weiner had in mind. As a marketer, he was a contrarian who felt the retro ambiance of his store -- just down the street, after all, from the flagship Barnes & Noble -- was appropriate for its stock. Not that he had to work at it. The dust, a clerk insisted yesterday, was always original. In addition to his sister, of Warwick, R.I., Mr. Weiner is survived by a brother, Michael, of South Natick, Mass., and his parents, David and Estelle Weiner of Coconut Creek, Fla."

It is one of the country's largest multi-industry conglomerates, with major interests in financial services, merchandising, manufacturing and transportation. Although Household had already began its diversification when he was elected president in 1972, it made major acquisitions, including Wein Air Alaska, under Mr. Ellis's leadership. Mr. Ellis became chairman of the corporation in 1974. Most recently, in 1981, he struck a $300 million deal to buy the Wallace Murray Corporation, a company with sales of almost $600 million that made truck engine components and metal-cutting tools. He was also highly regarded by analysts and associates for consolidating Household's divisions, selling off several unprofitable units and combining others. Mr. Ellis received a host of business and community awards. In 1974 he was a participant in President Ford's banking and finance conference and in the summit conference on inflation. He was described by James McCormack, a senior vice president at Household, as ''a conservative corporate leader who expected high personal morals and ethical behavior from his colleagues.''

6285,"Alton A. Lindsey, 92, Dies; Ecologist Left Global Imprint","Alton A. Lindsey, a pioneer ecologist who was believed to be the last living scientist from the Antarctica expeditions of Adm. Richard E. Byrd, died on Sunday at his home in Tulsa, Okla.","Alton A. Lindsey, a pioneer ecologist who was believed to be the last living scientist from the Antarctica expeditions of Adm. Richard E. Byrd, died on Sunday at his home in Tulsa, Okla. He was 92. Dr. Lindsey lived his life at the environmental ramparts. He studied penguins and seals in the Antarctic, permafrost in the Arctic and an enormous lava bed in New Mexico that became the 114,000-acre El Malpais National Monument. He studied starlings, volcanic vegetation, ducks and the sand dunes on the Indiana shore of Lake Michigan, which became the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore partly as a result of his labors. ""Few investigators, past or present, have achieved excellence in such varied aspects of ecology,"" the Ecological Society of America said in naming him ""eminent ecologist for 1976."" Dr. Lindsey's influence is suggested by the many things named after him. At Admiral Byrd's suggestion, 12 islands on the coast of Antarctica are called the Lindsey Islands. A new genus and species of bug was named after him, the Lindseyus coastus. The University of Arizona named the oldest dated wood in the American Southwest, the Lindsey Ancient Tree Site. The wood, in El Malpais National Monument, was traced to 190 B.C. through radiocarbon dating. Fellowships at Purdue University and Goshen College in Indiana were named for him. In 1988, the National Park Service presented the first Alton A. Lindsey Award in Science and Research Stewardship. Two months ago, Purdue University dedicated the Alton Lindsey Field Laboratory at its Ross Biological Reserve, which Dr. Lindsey founded 50 years earlier. But Dr. Lindsey's warm, soft-spoken touch, not to say his bad puns, was at the core of people's memories. He remembered with awe the first time he witnessed the Aurora Australis, the southern lights. He laughed about the time Admiral Byrd fell off a dogsled he was driving. He wrote a volume of ecological limericks under the pen name ""Windan Waters."" Alton A. Lindsey, the son of a Methodist minister in the Pittsburgh area, was born on May 7, 1907. He loved the outdoors and became an Eagle Scout. He studied wildlife, sometimes capturing birds to examine. When a family cat ate one, the cat disappeared, though the nephew who tells the family story, Ralph Levering, a historian, does not remember being told exactly how. Dr. Lindsey graduated from Allegheny College, and went on to Cornell University to study for his doctorate in biology. He interrupted his studies to serve as the vertebrate biologist from 1933 to 1935 on Admiral Byrd's second trip to the Antarctic. While Admiral Byrd and others traveled into the interior toward the South Pole, he stayed on the coast to study penguins, seals and other animals. On graduation from Cornell, he took a teaching job at American University in Washington, where he spotted a student named Elizabeth Smith. A few days later, he offered to carry her books home. Admiral Byrd attended their wedding reception. After his wife graduated from American, they spent their first summer together working at Glacier National Park as rangers, and their second summer at Mount Rainier, where Dr. Lindsey developed his interest in the patterns and complexities of vegetation. In 1940, the Lindseys moved to the University of the Redlands in California, and then to the University of New Mexico. In 1947, he accepted an appointment as professor of forest ecology at Purdue University, where he stayed until he retired in 1973. In 1951, he served as ecologist on an Arctic expedition to study permafrost, sponsored by the American and Canadian governments. In the late 1940's, he became an early and strong proponent of the natural areas preservation movement. He was a charter member of the Nature Conservancy and its Indiana chapter. He is credited with establishing the Pine Hills Nature Preserve and the Big Walnut Natural Area in Indiana. Dr. Lindsey wrote 10 books, 15 magazine articles and 70 technical papers, as well as serving as the editor of numerous magazines and journals. More playful were his limericks, many of which linked social and scientific concerns. One concerned the habits of African hornbills and read as follows: In a tree hole the female must stay. Fed by the male through a hole in the clay. She's beginning to hate Being jailed by her mate. So the wife now supports E.R.A. After retiring, he remained active in conservation causes, his family said. On occasion, he would wear immense fake whiskers and carry a long walking stick to impersonate the naturalist author John Burroughs and recite from Burroughs's books about natural phenomenon. He also remained a steadfast exponent of scientific rigor. As the debate over creationism versus Darwinism heated up in Oklahoma, he remained convinced that the overwhelming weight of evidence favored evolution. Dr. Lindsey is survived by his wife, a son, David Earl Lindsey of Alexandria, Va., and a daughter, Louise W. Lindsey of Tulsa. In a conversation with his minister five days before his death, Dr. Lindsey said: ""I've spent my life marveling at the beauty of what God created through evolution. And so many people these days miss seeing God's hand."" In his final days, when he could neither read nor talk, Dr. Lindsey listened to tapes of the songs of birds. http://www.nytimes.com"

58646,"M. King Hubbert, 86, Geologist; Research Changed Oil Production","M. King Hubbert, an award-winning scientist whose work in physics and geology brought radical changes in the petroleum industry, died Wednesday at his home in Bethesda, Md.","M. King Hubbert, an award-winning scientist whose work in physics and geology brought radical changes in the petroleum industry, died Wednesday at his home in Bethesda, Md. Dr. Hubbert, who was 86 years old, had been undergoing treatment for a pulmonary embolism. Dr. Hubbert's research in structural geology, the mechanics of earth deformation and the physics of underground movement of fluids led to sweeping changes in the way oil and gas are produced. His paper, ''Theory of Ground Water Motion,'' published in 1940, helped change methods of gas and oil exploration by showing that oil and gas flowed through cracks and pores in rocks and did not remain in static, subterranean pools as had been thought. Dr. Hubbert's work also led to his prediction in 1948 that worldwide supplies of petroleum were limited and that the United States would run short of petroleum in the 1970's, making the nation dependant on foreign oil. His repeated warnings in 1956, 1962 and 1967 went generally unheeded. It was not until the Arab oil embargo of 1973 that the full impact of his message was realized. Government agencies scaled back their estimates of gas and oil resources in the United States, and the nation began an energy policy that stressed conservation. Dr. Hubbert received the Rockefeller Public Service Award in 1977 and Columbia University's ''premier award for earth science,'' the Vetlesen Prize, in 1981. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and was the author of many articles in professional journals. Marion King Hubbert was born in San Saba, Tex. on Oct. 5, 1903, and earned undergraduate and graduate degrees at the University of Chicago. He earned a Ph.D. in geology and physics in 1937. Taught Geophysics at Columbia After working several years for the Amerada Petroleum Corporation, which later became the Amerada Hess Corporation, he became a teaching assistant at the University of Chicago. He joined the faculty of Columbia University in 1931 and taught geophysics until 1941. Dr. Hubbert was a senior analyst with the United States Board of Economic Warfare before becoming a research geophysicist with the Shell Oil Company in 1943. He worked with Shell in a variety of capacities until his mandatory retirement in 1964. He then became a research geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey and also taught at Stanford University. He retired in 1976. Dr. Hubbert is survived by his wife, Miriam; two sisters, Nell Jessup of Los Angeles and Dorothy Colin of Adrian, Tex., and two brothers, Leo Hubbert of Torrance, Calif., and Jack Hubbert of Ballinger, Tex."

He was 75 years old. He died of lung cancer, his wife, Trish, said. The ""Jack Sterling Show,"" broadcast Monday to Saturday from 1948 to 1966, was noted for its relaxed chatter, joking, storytelling, interviews, features on news and sports and tips on fishing sites. The show was one of the last radio programs to offer live music -- by a quintet occasionally joined by the host's drumming. Mr. Sterling succeeded Arthur Godfrey in the local show when that humorist joined the CBS network. Mr. Sterling, a six-footer with a trim mustache and contagious laugh, described his style this way: ""It isn't pleasant for most people to get up early in the morning, so we use the undersell, quiet approach."" On television, Mr. Sterling was the ringmaster on a children's circus show, ""Big Top,"" a Saturday program broadcast live from Philadelphia for seven years. He wrote two books, ""So Early in the Morning"" and ""The Sterling Cookbook,"" which distilled experiences from a favorite hobby. Mr. Sterling was born in Baltimore on June 24, 1915, to Jack Sexton and Edna Cable, veteran performers in vaudeville, showboats and stock companies. The son began acting at the age of 2, appearing as Little Willie in ""East Lynne."" He appeared in vintage hits and worked up a minstrel routine. At age 24, he turned to radio, working for stations in Peoria and Quincy, Ill.; St. Louis; Bridgeport, Conn., and Chicago. He worked for CBS and its affiliates for 25 years and retired in 1979.

He was 85 and lived in Falmouth. With his wife, Peggy, Mr. Samuels wrote or edited 10 books on art and history, including a well-received biography of the painter Frederic Remington and an encyclopedia of Western artists. They also wrote two books about the Spanish-American War and edited a volume of Remington's writings. Though Mr. Samuels and his wife had no formal training as art historians, they were tenacious researchers, and their books continue to be cited as authoritative texts. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Michael Kammen, a professor at Cornell, called ""Frederic Remington: A Biography"" (Doubleday, 1982) ""far more thorough and judicious"" than previous biographies. ""One of the central themes of this book is that Remington was a less glamorous and less attractive figure than his image makers presented,"" the review continued, ""albeit more interesting, more complex and more human."" Mr. Samuels, who had a law degree from Harvard, worked in business through his 50's, until he and his wife decided to sell their company -- American Leisure Products, or Alpco, which produced decorative chess sets and puzzles -- to devote themselves to their interest in art. They frequented auctions and estate sales and began dealing in American art, particularly by Remington and other Western artists. Their first book, ""The Illustrated Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists of the American West,"" a compilation of all they had learned about Western artists, was published in 1976, the year after they sold their company. ""Collected Writings of Frederic Remington"" followed in 1979.

44765,"Walter Zacharius, 87, Romance Publisher","Walter Zacharius, who rode the passion-swollen wave of romance fiction in the early 1980s to build the Kensington Publishing Corporation into a leading purveyor of bodice-rippers and other romance genres, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan.","Walter Zacharius, who rode the passion-swollen wave of romance fiction in the early 1980s to build the Kensington Publishing Corporation into a leading purveyor of bodice-rippers and other romance genres, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87. The cause was pancreatic cancer, his son, Steven, said. Mr. Zacharius emerged from the world of true-confession magazines and paperback genre fiction to found Kensington in 1974 with Roberta Grossman. Beating the bushes for overlooked writers and eager first-timers willing to start out cheap, the partners developed the careers of prolific and profit-generating authors like Janelle Taylor and Katherine Stone. As it expanded the romance genre to embrace paranormal romance, adult Western romance and romance titles aimed at Hispanic, black and gay readers, Kensington branched out into new forms of distribution. Mr. Zacharius signed deals with Wal-Mart, sold his books on the shopping network QVC and saw the potential of e-books early on. Through its Zebra, Dafina, Brava, Encanto and other imprints, Kensington publishes about 450 fiction and nonfiction books a year in a wide variety of genres. Although about 60 percent of its list is devoted to titles like ''A Little Bit Sinful'' and ''A Storm of Pleasure,'' it has also published ''I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell'' by Tucker Max. With sales of $70 million, the company is the largest independent publisher of mass-market titles in the United States. Zebra Books, the company's sole imprint until the late 1980s, became known for its embossed covers, with a lurid ''sunset'' palette of purples, pinks and oranges and a bold use of foil. Mr. Zacharius pushed the taste boundary even further in 1989, when he began putting holograms on his covers. Although the company occasionally published name writers, including Joyce Carol Oates, Isaac Asimov and Jerzy Kosinski, its economic well-being and its reputation lay with many writers largely unknown to The New York Review of Books -- best-sellers like Fern Michaels, Lisa Jackson and Beverly Barton. ''We're not impressed with what's selling on Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive,'' Mr. Zacharius told The New York Times in 1982. ''Our readers patronize suburban shopping malls.'' Walter Zacharius was born on Oct. 16, 1923, in Brooklyn, and attended public schools. He enlisted in the Army soon after leaving high school and took part in the Normandy invasion and the liberation of Paris. After returning to the United States, he found a job with Macfadden Publications, working on magazines like True Confessions and True Story before teaming up with Aaron A. Wyn at Ace, where he helped create Ace Double Novels, a paperback line that offered two books in one volume. With Irwin Stein, he founded Lancer Books in 1961 to publish genre fiction, primarily science fiction and fantasy, notably the ''Conan the Barbarian'' stories of Robert E. Howard. The company also turned out erotic crime and spy novels (''The Man From O.R.G.Y.'') and Gothic fiction, as well as the paperback edition of Mario Puzo's first novel, ''The Fortunate Pilgrim.'' In 1965, Mr. Zacharius jumped at a golden opportunity presented by ''Candy,'' a sex satire by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg, which had been published in Paris by Maurice Girodias and was unprotected by copyright in the United States. In a bit of literary swashbuckling, he undercut by 20 cents the 95-cent edition Dell planned to publish, emblazoning the cover with a big red lipstick print and the screaming come-on: ''Not one word changed! This is the ORIGINAL, UNCUT and UNEXPURGATED EDITION as first published and banned in Paris.'' In similar fashion, Zebra Books later capitalized on the runaway success of ''Iacocca,'' the autobiography of the Chrysler executive Lee A. Iacocca, by publishing the paperback edition of a little-read biography of Mr. Iacocca with the same title. The book ended up at No. 3 on the list of top-selling paperbacks for 1985. In 1988, Kensington began publishing hardcover books, placing two memoirs on the best-seller list that year: ''On the Outside Looking In,'' by Michael Reagan, the adopted son of Ronald Reagan and Jane Wyman, and ''The Duke of Flatbush,'' by the Brooklyn Dodger star Duke Snider, who died on Feb. 27. In addition to his son, Steven, of Melville, N.Y., the current president and chief executive of Kensington, Mr. Zacharius is survived by his wife, Suzanne; a daughter, Judith, of Fairbanks, Alaska; two grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter. His first wife, Alice, died in 2004. ''Songbird,'' a novel by Mr. Zacharius based on the harrowing wartime experiences of a Polish Jewish woman he met in Paris, was published in 2004 and later retitled ''The Memories We Keep.''"

St. George, a Jesuit who helped develop FM radio in New York City and more recently was an executive at the Jesuit-run Vatican Radio outside Rome, died on Friday in Evanston, Ill. He was 73. The Chicago Province of the Society of Jesus said that since undergoing cancer surgery last year, Father St. George had been in Evanston at the Canisius House Jesuit Community, which he helped found in 1955. A native of Syracuse, Father St. George joined the Jesuits in 1939 and was ordained as a priest in 1952. His studies in communications at Northwestern University then led to his appointment as chairman of the communications department at Fordham University in 1956. Experiment With FM The position put him in charge of Fordham's radio station, WFUV, which two years later went stereophonic with WFUV-FM. It was the first educational station licensed to experiment with the method, frequency modulation, and the first station to use it for stereo programming for the general public. Father St. George worked in Rome for 27 years. In 1972, he became director of the Press and Information Office of the Society of Jesus at the Jesuits' international headquarters. Starting in 1967, he was also assistant director of Vatican Radio for 15 years, during which he began its Studio A. The medium-wave program, which combined modern and classical music interspersed with scriptural and literary readings in English and Italian, won the Vatican new listeners from the Azores to the Aegean Islands. Father St. George also taught communications at Gregorian University. For the last six years he was executive director of Multimedia International, a communications research organization that assists religious orders and congregations."

Zeidler, a former mayor of Milwaukee who was the last Socialist to run a major American city, died Friday. He was 93. The cause was congestive heart failure and diverticulitis, said a hospital spokesman, Gregg Hartzog. Born in Milwaukee, Mr. Zeidler was part of the city's strong Socialist Party, which was fueled by German immigrants. The party had thousands of members, a Congressional seat and control of the mayor's office for nearly a half-century, ending with Mr. Zeidler from 1948 to 1960. ''Historians described him in the tradition of Milwaukee's sewer socialists,'' said Mr. Zeidler's daughter Jeanne, who followed her father into politics and is mayor of Williamsburg, Va. ''They were community leaders, mayors of Milwaukee who thought everyone should have access to plumbing in their homes. But he also had a bigger vision than that.'' His three terms as mayor were marked by large-scale construction of public housing, creation of the first educational television station in Wisconsin and city beautification programs. He also made strong statements on behalf of civil rights, Ms. Zeidler said. Mr. Zeidler said the word ''socialism'' was discredited when Stalin and Hitler used it in their rhetoric. Still, he remained an ardent Socialist until his death, serving as chairman of the Socialist Party U.S.A.. He never moved from the house he owned before being elected mayor. Mr. Zeidler wrote a 1,000-page manuscript in 1962 called ''A Liberal in City Government'' that was a memoir and a reflection on municipal government. It was finally published last year. ''I thought I would discharge the contents of my mind,'' he said of his work."

It was not regular paint. It was made with a relatively new material that most people did not know much about, something called radium. Watchmakers liked it because it glowed in the dark. Later, it became clear that it killed. Had Mrs. Keane stayed longer, she might have become one of the many sad stories involving the so-called radium girls, the hundreds of young women who worked with radium paint in factories early in the 20th century. Many were still in their 20s when they died of cancer from radiation poisoning. Others succumbed later, and to other health problems related to radium exposure. Many lost their teeth; some also lost their jawbones. They did not necessarily know why. But Mrs. Keane did not like the taste and texture of the paint or the tedium of the work. She was not very good at it, either. Her bosses were not impressed. After a few months, she was gone. It was the summer of 1924. She was 18. Within two decades she had lost all her teeth. Yet Mrs. Keane was a survivor who later conquered colon and breast cancer. She was 107 when she died on March 1 in Middlebury, Conn., perhaps the last living participant in a particularly dark moment in American industrial history. By the end of the 1920s, dozens of women had died in plants in Connecticut, Illinois and New Jersey. The dangers of radium were becoming more widely understood. New federal safeguards were put in place, in part under pressure from dial painters who worked together to demand compensation and better protection. The practice of ''lip pointing'' was stopped. Decades later, scientists dug up bones of the dead and found they were radioactive. Books, poems and at least one play have been written and documentary films have been made about the radium girls. Many years after the Waterbury Watch Company closed, radiation was still present at the site. ''She didn't know it was bad for her,'' Mrs. Keane's niece Patricia Cohn, who confirmed the death, said in an interview. ''She said it was gritty, and she didn't like putting it into her mouth.'' Mae Keane was born Mary O'Donnell on May 28, 1906, in Waterbury, the daughter of Irish immigrants who gave her the nickname Mae. Her father, William, was a foreman in a Waterbury factory. Her mother, the former Catherine Lynch, worked as a receptionist in a doctor's office. She graduated from Wilby High School and, after leaving the watch company, spent many years doing administrative work at the Plume & Atwood Manufacturing Company, which made brass lamps and the parts for them. Mrs. Keane's husband of 40 years, Timothy Keane, a police detective, died in 1981. They had no children. She lived the last 13 years with Ms. Cohn's family. Ms. Cohn's son, Timothy, a student at Pomperaug High School, won a bronze medal at the 2012 National History Day Contest for his project, a photography exhibition called ''Radium Girls: Tragedy Leading to Industrial Reform.'' Painting watch dials was promoted as ideally suited for delicate female hands. Mrs. Keane had expected it to be easy work, and the pay was good: a few cents for each dial she completed. ''We were young,'' she told The Hartford Courant in 2004. ''We didn't know anything about the paint.''"

Johnson, who fled Germany after Hitler seized his family's publishing business and founded Academic Press in New York, a major publisher of scientific books and journals, died Dec. 15 at his home in Manhattan.","Walter J. Johnson, who fled Germany after Hitler seized his family's publishing business and founded Academic Press in New York, a major publisher of scientific books and journals, died Dec. 15 at his home in Manhattan. He was 88. Mr. Johnson was the fifth generation of his family to own and operate a publishing company in Leipzig that specialized in scientific books and journals. After the Nazis seized the family's business in the late 1930's, along with most publishing operations in Germany, Mr. Johnson and his brother-in-law, Kurt Jacoby, and their wives, moved to New York, and in 1941, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Jacoby opened Academic Press. They owned and ran the company for nearly 30 years, with Mr. Jacoby taking charge of the editorial side and Mr. Johnson, as chief executive, the financial and business end. Revenues grew to more than $40 million from a stable of authors that included Albert Einstein. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich purchased Academic Press in 1970, soon after Mr. Jacoby's death. Mr. Johnson, who served on Harcourt Brace's board for 25 years, also continued to own and run two small companies, Walter J. Johnson Inc., which deals in rare books, and the Ablex Publishing Corporation, which publishes reference books. The offices of both are in Norwood, N.J., and Mr. Johnson had gone to his office on the Friday before his death. Mr. Johnson, who was born in Leipzig, had studied at the University of Heidelberg, the Sorbonne in Paris, and University College in London. He had joined the family business, run then by his father, and was in his late 20's when it was seized and he left Germany. He served in the National Guard from 1941 to 1944. Mr. Johnson's wife, Thelka, died in 1986. He is survived by a son, Herbert, of Greenwich, Conn.; two daughters, Marianne Cruikshank of Manhattan and Aspen, Colo., and Marjorie Hewett of Manhattan; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren."
35399,"Alan Vega, Punk Music Pioneer and Artist, Dies at 78","Alan Vega, the singer in the minimalist, proto-punk, proto-electro, proto-industrial two-man band Suicide and a prolific musician and visual artist on his own, died on Saturday.","Alan Vega, the singer in the minimalist, proto-punk, proto-electro, proto-industrial two-man band Suicide and a prolific musician and visual artist on his own, died on Saturday. He was 78. His death was announced in a statement from his family posted by the musician Henry Rollins, a longtime friend. The statement said he died in his sleep but did not say where he died or specify a cause. Mr. Vega had a stroke in 2012, but had continued to work as a visual artist. Suicide, particularly in its early years, was as much a provocation as a concert act. Formed in 1970, it was one of the first bands to bill themselves as ''punk music.'' With Martin Rev playing loud, insistently repetitive riffs on keyboards and drum machines and Mr. Vega crooning, chanting, muttering and howling his lyrics about insanity, mayhem and death, Suicide fiercely polarized its audiences. ''We almost got killed. I love that reaction,'' Mr. Vega once reminisced about Suicide's debut at the Boston nightclub the Rat. ''I'd say one half wanted to kill us and one half loved us.'' A notorious 23-minute show recorded in Brussels in 1978 turned into a riot; Suicide released a recording of it. Suicide's music would later be more widely tolerated, recognized as a precursor of electronic dance music and industrial rock. Although Suicide disbanded in the early 1980s, Mr. Vega and Mr. Rev occasionally reunited; in all, the duo released five studio albums from 1977 to 2002. Mr. Vega also made more than a dozen albums on his own and with collaborators. His music continued to explore repetition, drones, improvised lyrics and startling subject matter, but he also revealed his roots in rockabilly and sang an occasional love song. In the 2000s Mr. Vega resumed his career as a visual artist, with drawings and with sculptures often made from junk found on New York City streets. Mr. Vega was born Boruch Alan Bermowitz on June 23, 1938 in New York City, and grew up in the Bensonhurst area of Brooklyn. He majored in fine arts and physics at Brooklyn College, studying with Ad Reinhardt and Kurt Seligmann. In the late 1960s he was affiliated with Museum: A Project of the Living Artists, a multimedia gallery, studio and performance loft in Greenwich Village, where he experimented with electronic music and made sculptures featuring light bulbs and found materials. He and Mr. Rev played their first shows as Suicide there. Mr. Vega had been galvanized by seeing a concert at which Iggy Pop, lead singer of the Stooges, leapt into the audience and ended the show bloody and triumphant. ''It showed me you didn't have to do static artworks; you could create situations, do something environmental,'' Mr. Vega told The Village Voice in 2002. ''That's what got me moving more intensely in the direction of doing music.'' In the trashy, fertile downtown New York City arts world of the early 1970s, Suicide performed at the Mercer Arts Center, Max's Kansas City and CBGB as well as at art galleries. The band was initially a trio, including a guitarist, but by 1972 it was just Mr. Vega and Mr. Rev. . Suicide's self-titled debut album was released in 1977. It included a staple of the duo's live shows, ''Frankie Teardrop,'' a 10-minute song with a relentless two-note keyboard line and a hissing electronic beat about a desperate factory worker who kills his wife and child. The album received praise in England but negative reviews from The Voice and from Rolling Stone (which would much later place it in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time). In 1978 the duo toured Europe and Britain, opening for Elvis Costello and the Clash; it was often booed and sometimes worse. In Glasgow, Mr. Vega ducked a flying ax. ''Everybody came in to see Suicide to be entertained,'' he told Ink19 magazine, ''and all we did was give them back the street, in all its glory, and that's what they hated us for.'' But Suicide also garnered fans like Bruce Springsteen, who has said he modeled his song ''State Trooper'' on ''Frankie Teardrop.'' Mr. Springsteen has often played Suicide's ''Dream Baby Dream'' in concert, and recorded it for his 2014 album ''High Hopes.'' Ric Ocasek, the Cars' main songwriter, produced Suicide's second album, ''Suicide: Alan Vega and Martin Rev,'' in 1980, and would continue to contribute to Mr. Vega's solo albums. Mr. Vega's first two solo albums, ''Alan Vega'' and ''Collision Drive,'' traded keyboards for echoey guitars and a rockabilly backbeat, and he had a European hit with ''Jukebox Babe.'' In the early 1980s he was signed to Elektra Records, and with Mr. Ocasek producing he made his closest approach to pop on the album ''Saturn Strip'' in 1983. He was also working as a visual artist. An exhibition of his assemblages inaugurated Barbara Gladstone's downtown gallery in 1983. On later solo albums, Mr. Vega set aside pop expectations, following his inclinations toward ferocious electronic propulsion, guitar twang and blunt lyrics, combined without compromise. One of his musical collaborators during the 1990s, Liz Lamere, married him; she survives him, as does their son, Dante. Meanwhile, Mr. Vega had exhibitions of his art in France and New York. In 2002, Jeffrey Deitch mounted ''Collison Drive,'' featuring reconstructions of some of Mr. Vega's 1970s works, at his gallery in Lower Manhattan. And last year the Invisible-Exports gallery on the Lower East Side presented what it said was his first full exhibition of new work since 1983. By the 1990s, reunion tours by Suicide met audiences who were no longer hostile, but admiring. ''You can't cause a riot now, anyway,'' Mr. Vega said in a 2003 interview. ''The kids today, they've seen it all already.''"

Gair, a veteran broadcast journalist best known for her public-affairs talk show on Chicago radio, died on Wednesday in Northwestern Memorial Hospital. She was 70 and lived in Chicago. She died of complications from breast cancer, her family said. Ms. Gair was the executive producer of an hourlong program of world news and public affairs on WBEZ-FM, the National Public Radio affiliate in Chicago. Airing weekdays since 1986, ""Midday with Sondra Gair"" was conceived by her as a way to cover breaking news as she interviewed political leaders and journalists and encouraged callers to give their views. Her topics ranged as widely as her selection of guests. She interviewed correspondents, policy experts and government leaders by telephone. She was respected for her fairness, for letting all sides have their say. ""She had a particular gift of intimacy with her listeners,"" said Carole Nolan, general manager of WBEZ and a longtime friend. ""Sondra called the world, from the king of Greece to cabdrivers."" ""Midday with Sondra Gair"" went off the air in mid-March. In tribute, WBEZ fell silent for an hour yesterday after a brief eulogy by Ms. Nolan. Sondra Gair was born in Cicero, Ill., and grew up in Chicago. She studied speech, acting and journalism at Northwestern University, which proclaimed her ""Alumna of the Year"" in 1992. She began her radio career in the 1940's, appearing regularly in soap operas, dramas and comedy shows. But her interest in news reporting eventually made her to turn to broadcast journalism with on-site reports on the arts, politics and mores of England, China, the Netherlands, Mexico and Israel. She joined WBEZ in 1975 and conducted various interview shows before beginning the midday program for which she was best known. Ms. Gair is survived by a daughter, Patricia Sweeney of Kingston upon Thames, England; two sons, Judd Rose of Manhattan and Roger Rose of Los Angeles; her mother, Rose Gair of Chicago; a brother, Seymour Gair of suburban Chicago, and three grandchildren."

He was 64 years old and lived in Keller, Tex. He died less than an hour after he arrived at the emergency room, said Loretta Saunders, a nursing supervisor. The cause of death had not been determined, she said. Cherubic-looking yet perpetually disheveled, Mr. McFarland began his acting career at age 3, modeling baby clothes in his hometown of Dallas. ""I was probably 5 or 6 years old before I realized that all kids weren't in movies,"" he recalled in 1988. 84 Films in Seven Years It was headline news when he announced that he was retiring from ""Our Gang"" -- the most popular juvenile series ever filmed -- in 1938, when he was all of 10 years old. In seven years as an actor, he had appeared in 84 pictures. But by then, he said, he had ""kinda lost track"" of them all. One was ""Kentucky Kernels,"" released when he was 6. He played a toddler with a fondness for trying out bricks, rocks and hammers on different kinds of windows and windshields. Exciting as that was to the Depression-era Saturday matinee crowd, it was nothing compared to the hair-raising scene that followed. His ""uncles"" took Spanky to Kentucky to claim his estate. Soon they were staring down the muzzles of four rifles aimed by a hillbilly firing squad. A Star for Wonder Bread His big break came not in a movie but in a minute-long Wonder Bread commercial. His aunt sent McFarland to the director Hal Roach, the creative force behind ""Our Gang,"" and soon he was cutting up on screen as the foil for his best friend, Alfalfa. Mr. Roach originated the ""Our Gang"" comedies in 1922 after watching a group of youngsters playing in a lumber yard. Their antics appealed to him as an antidote to the mini-adults that stage mothers constantly shepherded into his office. He insisted that all ""Our Gang"" shooting be scheduled in accord with the youngsters' lives, schooling and recreation. But Mr. McFarland said that the on-the-set schooling he received had its disadvantages. Neighborhood playmates envied him for having to attend school for only a couple of hours a day and for having a private tutor. ""This was my life: get up in the morning, go to the studio and during the day get somewhere in the neighborhood of three hours of schooling, not necessarily at the same time; take an hour for lunch, and that leaves five hours of shooting for film."" In addition to ""Our Gang,"" McFarland made 14 feature-length movies, including ""Trail of the Lonesome Pine"" (1936) with Henry Fonda and Fred MacMurray and ""The Woman in the Window"" (1944) with Joan Bennett and Edward G. Robinson. He also served in the Air Force and later went into sales, working for a wine company, an appliance manufacturer and a boot company. He is survived by his wife, Doris, and three children."

He was 85 and lived in Berkeley. The cause was a heart attack, the university said. Dr. Kip, working in the branch of physics dealing with the fundamental properties of solids like structure, binding forces, electrical, magnetic and optical qualities and their effects, led a Berkeley research team for many years. The team, focusing on the interactions of matter with microwave radiation, conducted experiments that resulted in nearly 100 papers in scientific publications. In the 1950's, just after the discovery of transistors, his group used its expertise to take some of the first measurements of the basic properties of semiconductors, detailing the structure of the materials. He also contributed significantly to the study of the atomic structure of metals. Born in Los Angeles, Dr. Kip graduated from Berkeley, where he also received his Ph.D. in physics in 1939. In World War II he served with a Navy group researching antiaircraft and anti-submarine warfare. He returned to Berkeley in 1951 to help establish a research group that applied microwave resonance techniques to the investigation of solids. He continued those studies until his retirement in 1976. He was the author of a widely used introductory college textbook, ""Fundamentals of Electricity and Magnetism"" (McGraw-Hill; 2d ed., 1968), which remains in print.

Mr. Regen was born in 1959 in New York City and was a graduate of Skidmore College, where he studied arts administration. His interest in art stemmed partly from that of his mother, Barbara Gladstone, who opened her own gallery in Manhattan in 1980. Mr. Regen's first job in the art world was chief preparator at P.S. 1., an alternative space in Long Island City. In 1985 and '86, he worked briefly as an assistant at a gallery in Cologne, Germany, and then moved to Los Angeles, working as director of the Fred Hoffman Gallery. In December 1989, five weeks after he was diagnosed with cancer, he opened his own gallery in West Hollywood. At first he concentrated on artists from New York and Europe, some represented by his mother, whose work was not well known in Los Angeles. In 1991 he married Shaun Caley, who became his business partner. In 1992, as the art market waned, the couple relocated to a smaller space next door to the gallery, which they renamed Regen Projects. They began to focus on Los Angeles artists like Lari Pittman and Charles Ray as well as such emerging artists as Toba Khedoori, Laura Owens, Catherine Opie, Frances Stark and Jennifer Pastor, who were often showing their work for the first time. The couple gave the New York sculptor and film maker Matthew Barney his first gallery exhibition. Los Angeles stimulated Mr. Regen's interests in the movies. In the early 1990's, after reading ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" a semi-autobiographical novel by John O'Brien, he met with the writer, optioned the book and contacted his friend, the director Mike Figgis, who eventually directed the award-winning 1995 movie based on the book. Mr. Regen was credited as associate producer. In addition to his wife and his mother, Mr. Regen is survived by his grandmother, Evelyn Leavitt of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and two brothers, David and Richard, both of Manhattan."

59235,"M. Scott Peck, Self-Help Author, Dies at 69","M. Scott Peck, the psychiatrist and author whose best-selling book ''The Road Less Traveled'' offered millions of readers an inspirational prescription of self-discipline, died on Sunday at his home in Warren, Conn.","M. Scott Peck, the psychiatrist and author whose best-selling book ''The Road Less Traveled'' offered millions of readers an inspirational prescription of self-discipline, died on Sunday at his home in Warren, Conn. He was 69. The cause was complications of pancreatic and liver duct cancer, said Michael Levine, a friend and publicist. Dr. Peck is among the founding fathers of the self-help genre of books, which retain their popularity from year to year. ''The Road Less Traveled,'' published in 1978, and its later companion volumes, ''Further Along the Road Less Traveled'' (1993) and ''The Road Less Traveled and Beyond'' (1997), have sold more than 5 million copies in North America, according to Dr. Peck's publisher, Simon & Schuster, and have been translated into more than 20 languages. '''The Road Less Traveled' really marked the beginning of contemporary self-help,'' said Jan Miller, a literary agent whose firm, Dupree Miller & Associates, represents other stars in the field, including Dr. Phil McGraw and Joel Osteen. ''It was a significant work because he was able to blend the psychology and the spiritual so magnificently.'' Unlike the huge best sellers of today, however, which arrive in bookstores accompanied by blaring trumpets of publicity, ''The Road Less Traveled'' went all but unnoticed when it was released in 1978. Simon & Schuster initially printed only about 5,000 copies, one of which was sent to Phyllis Theroux at The Washington Post. Ms. Theroux was later quoted as saying that she spent two weeks writing a review ''that would force people to buy the book.'' That eventually happened, but only after Dr. Peck labored to stimulate sales by copying the review and sending it to several hundred newspapers around the country. The hardcover book sold a respectable 12,000 copies, and the paperback edition sold 30,000 in its first year. That number doubled in each of the next two years, and in mid-1983, five years after publication, ''The Road Less Traveled'' reached the New York Times best-seller list for the first time. It has since spent 694 weeks on the list, the equivalent of more than 13 years. ''The most common response I have received to 'The Road Less Traveled' in letters from readers,'' Dr. Peck wrote in 2003 in an introduction to the 25th-anniversary edition of the book, ''has been one of gratitude for my courage, not for saying anything new, but for writing about the kind of things they had been thinking and feeling all along, but were afraid to talk about.'' The book focused on Dr. Peck's core belief that, as stated in its opening sentence, ''Life is difficult,'' and that its problems can be addressed only through self-discipline. Humans, however, tend to try to avoid problems, a habit that only creates more difficulties, Dr. Peck said. To that dose of self-discipline, Dr. Peck added an inseparable spiritual element. ''I make no distinction between the mind and the spirit, and therefore no distinction between the process of achieving spiritual growth and achieving mental growth,'' Dr. Peck wrote in the preface to the original book. ''They are one and the same.'' Dr. Peck's approach to self-discipline was infused not only with his general belief in the help of higher power, which made his books particularly popular with 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous, but also with his specifically Christian personal beliefs, which crystallized relatively late in life. As the biography on his Web site explains, he was baptized in a nondenominational ceremony at the age of 43, by a Methodist minister in an Episcopal convent, where he had frequently gone on retreat. Morgan Scott Peck was born May 22, 1936, in New York. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy but was expelled from Middlebury College during his sophomore year for refusing to attend mandatory R.O.T.C. sessions. He transferred to Harvard, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1958, and he received a medical degree in 1963 from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. Dr. Peck then spent nearly 10 years as a psychiatrist in the Army, something that he once admitted was an ''odd choice'' given his college experience. He said that he became opposed to the Vietnam War soon after joining the Army but also viewed the experience as a way to study the behavior of individuals and organizations. Dr. Peck is survived by his wife, Kathleen Kline Yates Peck. His first marriage, to Lily Ho, ended in divorce. He is also survived by their three children: a son, Christopher, and two daughters, Belinda and Julie. Dr. Peck wrote several other books, including a novel, ''A Bed by the Window'' (Bantam, 1990), and two other nonfiction best sellers, ''People of the Lie'' (Simon & Schuster, 1983), an exploration of human evil, and ''The Different Drum'' (Simon and Schuster, 1987), which looked at the nature of community. Jonathan Dolger, who bought ''The Road Less Traveled'' for Simon & Schuster as an editor there and who later became Dr. Peck's literary agent, said neither he nor the author considered the book a self-help manual. ''In some ways it is an inspirational book,'' he said. ''But I have no idea what made it such a success, and I don't think Scotty had an idea either.''"

31521,,"The Rev. Joseph M. Kitagawa, a theologian who was instrumental in establishing religion as an independent discipline on America's campuses and in introducing the religions of Japan to the West, died Wednesday in Chicago.","The Rev. Joseph M. Kitagawa, a theologian who was instrumental in establishing religion as an independent discipline on America's campuses and in introducing the religions of Japan to the West, died Wednesday in Chicago. He was 77 years old. He died of pneumonia at the Bernard Mitchell Hospital after suffering a stroke earlier this year, said Jeff Makos, a spokesman for the University of Chicago. Dr. Kitagawa was the former dean of the university's School of Divinity. Dr. Kitagawa, who lived in Hyde Park, had been associated with the divinity school since he was a doctoral student there in the late 1940's. He joined the faculty after he graduated in 1951. At the time of his death, he held the title of professor emeritus and until recently continued publishing and consulting with students. A colleague at the divinity school, the Rev. Martin E. Marty, said of Dr. Kitagawa: ""He wrote more books after retirement than many professors write during their entire lifetime."" His effort to introduce the religions of Japan to the West virtually spanned his publishing career from his ""Religions of the East"" in 1960 (Westminster Press) to ""Spiritual Liberation and Human Freedom in Contemporary Asia"" in 1990 (Peter Lang). But his interests were not limited to Japan. His last book, published earlier this year, was ""The Christian Tradition: Beyond its European Captivity"" (Trinity Press International). Together with the late Mircea Eliade, the theologian who was a colleague at the divinity school, and others, Dr. Kitagawa was a founding editor in 1960 of the international journal, ""History of Religions."" The journal helped define and establish the study of religion as an independent academic discipline rather than as an aspect of some other course of study such as sociology or psychology. Publication of the journal grew out of an international conference on the History of Religions held in 1959 at the University of Chicago. Essays from the conference were collected in ""The History of Religions: Essays in Methodology,"" (University of Chicago Press), one of numerous books edited by Dr. Kitagawa and Dr. Eliade. Dr. Kitagawa served as dean of the divinity school, one of the nation's most prominent training grounds for Protestant ministers and for the academic study of religion, from 1970 to 1980. Surviving Through 'Spirit' He was born in Osaka, Japan, on March 8, 1915. He came to the United States in 1941 to study theology but his life was disrupted when, like tens of thousands of others of Japanese ancestry, he was sent to a detention camp by the Government. He spent three and a half year in detention, first at the Enemy Alien Detention Camp in Santa Fe, N.M., and later at the Army Internment Camp at Lordsburg, N.M., where he was ordained as a priest by an Episcopal bishop who visited the camp. He was then sent to the Minidoka War Relocation Center Camp at Hunt, Idaho, where he remained until October 1945. While in internment in Idaho he served as a minister to an Episcopal church as he did later in Seattle after his release. In his early days at the University of Chicago, he also worked with Japanese-Americans on behalf of the Episcopal bishop of Chicago. Only recently, in his new book, ""The Christian Tradition,"" did he write about his incarceration. He wrote that the immigrants survived the ordeal through their ""spirit, which enabled them to endure and overcome almost insurmountable difficulties, disappointments and setbacks."" Dr. Marty, who served as an associate dean during Dr. Kitagawa's first five years as head of the divinity school, said that Dr. Kitagawa drew on his incarceration when students at the school were protesting the War in Vietnam. ""He related his experiences as a war-time prisoner during a speech to students,"" Dr. Marty said. ""It was the only time I remember him talking about it. He said, 'I know you all have criticism of our country. I do too. You're not the only generation that has suffered. For almost four years I was detained in a camp. But I still want this to be my place of destiny.' "" He became a United States citizen in 1955. Dr. Kitagawa is survived by his wife, Evelyn; a daughter, Anne Rose Kitagawa of Chicago, and two sisters, Michi Tsuda and Mie Kitagawa of Oaska, Japan."

She was 87. Her son Craig told The Associated Press that she died from complications of emergency surgery to repair a ruptured aneurysm. Ms. Darcel's best-known films include ''Battleground'' (1949), a World War II picture starring Van Johnson in which she had a small role as a French peasant; ''Westward the Women'' (1951), in which she starred opposite Robert Taylor as one of a convoy of mail-order brides; and ''Vera Cruz'' (1954), in which she played a French noblewoman escorted through 19th-century Mexico by Burt Lancaster and Gary Cooper. On Broadway, Ms. Darcel appeared in ''Pardon Our French,'' a musical revue starring the vaudevillians Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson, which opened in 1950 and played 100 performances. Ms. Darcel, who made no films after the early 1960s, later sang in nightclubs and performed in regional theater and summer stock. Denise Billecard was born in France in 1924. After a victory in a beauty contest garnered her the title ''most beautiful girl in Paris,'' she worked as a nightclub singer there before coming to the United States after the war. During her vogue in the 1950s, American critics were inclined to look more favorably on her face and figure than on her dramatic skills. But the tabloid press made much of her off-screen life, chronicling her marriages and divorces (she had several of each) and the peregrinations of her hemlines and necklines. In addition to her son Craig, Ms. Darcel's survivors include another son, Chris. Her other films include ''To the Victor'' (1948), ''Tarzan and the Slave Girl'' (1950), ''Young Man With Ideas'' (1952), ''Flame of Calcutta'' (1953) and ''Seven Women From Hell'' (1961). On television, she had guest roles on ''Naked City'' and ''Combat!'' In an interview with The New York Times in 1949, before ''Battleground'' opened, Ms. Darcel demonstrated a keen awareness of the irony that attended her passage to the screen. ''In Paris, I am a singer and glamorous,'' she said. ''I come to Hollywood and I am a peasant!''"
11257,VINCENT IMPELLITTERI IS DEAD; MAYOR OF NEW YORK IN 1950's,"Vincent R. Impellitteri, an immigrant cobbler's son who defied the Democratic machine of Tammany Hall and became Mayor of New York from 1950 to 1953, died of heart failure yesterday at Bridgeport (Conn.) Hospital.","Vincent R. Impellitteri, an immigrant cobbler's son who defied the Democratic machine of Tammany Hall and became Mayor of New York from 1950 to 1953, died of heart failure yesterday at Bridgeport (Conn.) Hospital. He was 86 years old. Mr. Impellitteri, who retired as a Criminal Court judge in 1965, had been ill with Parkinson's disease for the last four years and, though he maintained a residence at the New York Athletic Club, had stayed in convalescent homes, most recently the Carolton Convalescent Hospital in Fairfield, Conn. He entered Bridgeport Hospital early this week with an infection and died at 2:40 P.M. yesterday. In an era of flamboyant politicians and corruption scandals, Mr. Impelliteri - deliberate, scholarly, mild to the point of shyness - struck a responsive chord with New York voters and became the first person to become mayor of New York without the support of a major political party. The stage was set in September 1950 when, with a political scandal about to break, William O'Dwyer resigned as Mayor to accept President Truman's appointment as Ambassador to Mexico, and Mr. Impellitteri - an O'Dwyer protege who had been City Council president since 1946 - became Acting Mayor. An Upset Victory A special election was called to fill the three remaining years of Mr. O'Dwyer's term, and Mr. Impellitteri, who had been squabbling off and on with the Manhattan Democratic machine known as Tammany Hall, did not get his party's nomination. Defying the Tammany Tiger, Mr. Impellitteri - who had been Acting Mayor during Mr. O'Dwyer's frequent vacations - ran as an independent under the banner of the Experience Party. He was a slightly built, courteous man with little of the turbulent energy or whimsical humor of former Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia or Mr. O'Dwyer. His speech was devoid of colorful language and his gestures seemed limited to clasping his hands or slowly twisting one of the dozen cigars he smoked daily. Even astute political observers gave him little chance to win, but a volunteer organization sprang up almost overnight, and his fight against the machine captured the imagination of New Yorkers, who gave him a 225,000-vote plurality in a three-way race to become the city's 101st mayor. After the election, he made peace with Democratic leaders in all the boroughs except Manhattan, but he continued to deny patronage to the Tammany leader, Carmine G. DeSapio, and this contributed to his political downfall. Proposed Transit Agency Though not of his own making, a series of inherited scandals - most of them involving payoffs by gamblers to the police and shakedowns of businesses by firefighters - beset the Impellitteri administration, along with postwar inflation and fiscal worries stemming from entrenched budgets based on stop-gap measures. Mayor Impellitteri instituted plans to cut costs and to create long-term financial stability for the city government, proposed what was to become an independent Transit Authority to take transit affairs out of politics and named a former United States Attorney, Thomas F. Murphy, as police commissioner with a widely acclaimed mandate to root out corruption. But the brush of scandal touched some members of his staff and, though Mr. Impellitteri himself was never accused of wrongdoing, his administration was hurt by it. What political observers called his lack of forcefulness in dealings with Gov. Thomas E. Dewey and the Republican-dominated Legislature also raised doubts. Defeated by Wagner And when he sought re-election in 1953, the opposition of Tammany Hall proved decisive. He was easily defeated by the Manhattan Borough President, Robert F. Wagner, who went on to serve three terms as mayor. Mr. Impellitteri stepped down on Dec. 31, 1953, and two days later was named to a judgeship by Mayor Wagner. To say that Vincent Richard Impellitteri rose from obscurity would be an understatement of the first magnitude. He was born on Feb. 4, 1900, in the village of Isnello, Sicily. His father, Salvatore Impellitteri, was a shoemaker who brought the family to the Lower East Side when Vincent was a child. The family later moved to Ansonia, Conn. The boy graduated from Ansonia High School in 1917. He joined the Navy and served in World War I as a radioman on a destroyer. After the war, he attended the Fordham Law School, going to classes by day while serving successively as a night bellboy and manager at a Broadway hotel. He became a United States citizen in 1922 and earned his law degree in 1924. After admission to the bar, he joined a law firm in which Martin Conboy, an influential Democratic figure, was a member. From 1929 to 1938, Mr. Impellitteri served as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan. He then returned to private law practice, mainly handling criminal cases. Since his college days, he had been active in Democratic politics, and, through these associations, was named in 1941 as law secretary to Justice Peter Schmuck of State Supreme Court. Later, he became secretary to Justice Joseph Gavagan. A Reputation for Honesty A modest, unassuming man, Mr. Impellitteri was virtually unknown to New Yorkers when he was elected president of the City Council, the No. 2 position at City Hall, in 1945. It was said that when Democratic leaders were looking for a likely candidate for the Council presidency, they thumbed through the ''Green Book,'' the city's official directory, until they came upon the name Vincent Impellitteri, then a judicial clerk. He had a reputation for honesty, ability and party loyalty, and it was thought that as an Italian-born Roman Catholic he could help the O'Dwyer ticket. Mr. Impellitteri had one drawback. As a report in The New York World-Telegram put it, he had had ''the injudicious good taste to snub Frank Costello, the gambler and racketeer who often has been called the czar behind the scenes of Tammany. Tammany Hall opposed Mr. Impellitteri's selection, but Mr. O'Dwyer insisted upon it, and the ticket won handily in 1945. In the next four years, Mr. Impellitteri worked quietly, overshadowed by Mr. O'Dwyer, and was rewarded in 1949 by being named to the ticket again. While they were re-elected, the effects of the growing scandal were already being felt, and Mr. O'Dwyer polled only 1.2 million votes to Mr. Impellitteri's 1.3 million. Mr. O'Dwyer, who was increasingly preoccupied with the scandal, resigned on Sept. 2, 1950, and Mr. Impellitteri succeeded him as Acting Mayor. Two days later, he announced that he would run in the special election. Won Many Endorsements Though he lacked Tammany support, he won endorsements from citizens' groups and newspapers, who called him ''Impy,'' and he attracted a wide following. The New York Times, in an editorial, said: ''He doesn't jump into decisions; in fact, he seems to make up his mind very deliberately, especially on financial matters. He does not create emergencies. He gives the impression of dogged earnestness and good intentions.'' In those times of upheaval, he seemed to be just what the voters wanted. In an interview in 1965, when he retired from the Criminal Court bench, he recalled having been ''keenly disappointed'' at not being re-elected Mayor. But, he added, ''I never became bitter.'' He also noted that fame was fleeting. He often walked through the streets of New York, he said, and people smiled at him and called him ''Impy'' or ''Judge.'' But many others did not recognize him and had no idea that he had been mayor. Mr Impellitteri married the former Elizabeth Agnes McLaughlin in 1926. The couple had no children. Mrs. Impellitteri died in 1967. He is survived by a sister, Mrs. Rose Concowich of Derby, Conn. A funeral will be held Monday at 9:15 A.M. at Spinelli-Malerba Funeral Home in Ansonia, Conn., followed by a Mass of Christian Burial at 10 A.M. at Holy Rosary Church in Ansonia. Burial will be in Mount Saint Peter's Cemetery in Derby."

26751,"Mattiwilda Dobbs, Black Soprano and Principal at Met, Dies at 90","Mattiwilda Dobbs, a coloratura soprano who was the third African-American to appear as a principal singer with the Metropolitan Opera, died on Tuesday at her home in Atlanta.","Mattiwilda Dobbs, a coloratura soprano who was the third African-American to appear as a principal singer with the Metropolitan Opera, died on Tuesday at her home in Atlanta. She was 90. Her death was confirmed by a niece, Michele Jordan. Though Ms. Dobbs's voice was not immense, she was routinely praised by critics for its crystalline purity and supple agility, and for her impeccable intonation, sensitive musicianship and captivating stage presence. She also had a highly regarded international career as a recitalist, singing at Town Hall in New York and on other celebrated stages, and was especially renowned as an interpreter of Schubert lieder. When Ms. Dobbs made her Met debut, as Gilda in Verdi's ''Rigoletto,'' on Nov. 9, 1956, she had already sung to great acclaim at La Scala in Milan, where she was the first black principal singer; Covent Garden in London; and the San Francisco Opera, where she had made her United States operatic debut, as the Queen of Shemakha in Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Le Coq d'Or,'' in 1955. At the Met, she was preceded by two black singers: the contralto Marian Anderson, who made her debut in January 1955, and the baritone Robert McFerrin, who made his a few weeks later. (Mr. McFerrin was the father of the jazz singer Bobby McFerrin.) Reviewing Ms. Dobbs's Met debut, opposite the baritone Leonard Warren, Howard Taubman wrote in The New York Times: ''The young soprano has a voice of substance and quality, well placed and expertly controlled. Her singing is true, flexible at the top in coloratura passages and glowing in texture throughout the scale.'' The first black woman to be offered a long-term contract by the Met, Ms. Dobbs appeared with the company 29 times through 1964. Her roles there included Oscar the pageboy (sung by a soprano) in Verdi's ''Un Ballo in Maschera''; Zerlina in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni''; and the title part in Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' for which, The Daily News reported in 1957, the audience summoned her back for nine curtain calls after she had sung her mad scene. If Ms. Dobbs is less well remembered today than some singers of her era, that is partly because she made relatively few recordings. It is also because her debut fell between the historic advent of Ms. Anderson and the blazing ascendance of Leontyne Price, widely considered the first black operatic superstar, who made her Met debut in 1961. What was more, Ms. Dobbs happened to have joined the Met as part of the incoming class of 1956-57 -- a group of newly hired principal singers that included the titanic sopranos Antonietta Stella and Maria Callas. Named for a grandmother, Mattie Wilda Sykes, Mattiwilda Dobbs was born in Atlanta on July 11, 1925, the fifth of six daughters of John Wesley Dobbs and the former Irene Ophelia Thompson. Hers was a distinguished family: Ms. Dobbs's father, a mail-train clerk, was long active in civic affairs, helping to register black voters as early as the 1930s. In the late 1940s he helped found the Atlanta Negro Voters League. Mr. Dobbs insisted on a college education, along with seven years' study of the piano, for each of his daughters, and he prevailed in every instance. As a girl, Mattiwilda also sang in her church choir but, retiring and bashful, did not envision a performing career. She began voice lessons in earnest only as an undergraduate at Spelman College in Atlanta. After earning her bachelor's degree -- she graduated first in her class with majors in Spanish and music -- the young Ms. Dobbs moved North at her father's insistence for advanced vocal training. ''I would never have been a singer if it were not for my father,'' she told Look magazine in 1969. ''I was too shy.'' In New York, Ms. Dobbs became a pupil of the German soprano Lotte Leonard; she also studied at Tanglewood. At the same time, as a hedge against the uncertainties of a career in music, she earned a master's degree in Spanish from Columbia University Teachers College. Ms. Dobbs was a winner of the Marian Anderson Scholarship Fund in 1948, and received a scholarship from the John Hay Whitney Foundation not long afterward. On the strength of her awards, she moved to Paris, where she studied with the art-song specialist Pierre Bernac. In 1951, she came to wide international attention by winning a first prize in the Geneva International Music Competition. Over the years, Ms. Dobbs also sang at the Glyndebourne Festival in England and with the Royal Swedish Opera, the Hamburg State Opera and the Israel Philharmonic. In 1959, she was one of four Americans -- the others were Gary Cooper, Edward G. Robinson and the producer Harold Hecht -- sent by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to establish a cultural exchange program with the Soviet Union. Ms. Dobbs's first husband, Luis Rodriguez Garcia de la Piedra, a Spanish journalist whom she married in 1953, died the next year. (Only days after his death, she honored a commitment to sing at Covent Garden before the new monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.) In 1957 Ms. Dobbs married Bengt Janzon, a Swedish journalist, and she was known afterward in private life as Mattiwilda Dobbs Janzon. Mr. Janzon died in 1997. Ms. Dobbs's survivors include a sister, June Dobbs Butts. Ms. Dobbs's recordings include Mozart's ''The Abduction From the Seraglio,'' Bizet's ''The Pearl Fishers'' and Offenbach's ''Tales of Hoffmann.'' After retiring from the concert stage, Ms. Dobbs taught voice at the University of Texas, Spelman College and, for many years, Howard University in Washington. Throughout her career, Ms. Dobbs refused to sing in segregated concert halls. She did not perform in her hometown, Atlanta, for instance, until 1962, when she sang before an integrated audience at the Municipal Auditorium there. In January 1974 she performed at another epochal Atlanta event, singing the spiritual ''He's Got the Whole World in His Hands'' at the inauguration of the city's first black mayor, Maynard Jackson. The choice of Ms. Dobbs to perform at Mr. Jackson's inauguration seemed almost foreordained, and not merely because of their shared background as racial pioneers. Mr. Jackson, the great-great-grandson of a slave, was also Ms. Dobbs's nephew."

Reflecting his habit of provocation, Professor Mazrui wrote an article in 2012, posted on Facebook, accusing Dr. Schweitzer, the revered medical missionary in pre-independence Gabon, of being ''a benevolent racist.'' He wrote that Dr. Schweitzer had called Africans ''primitives'' and ''savages,'' and had treated Africans in a hospital unit that was separate from, and less comfortable than, one for whites. Professor Mazrui's courage transcended ideas. When he was a political-science professor in Uganda in the early 1970s, the country's brutal dictator, Idi Amin, invited him to be his chief adviser on international affairs -- ''his Kissinger,'' Professor Mazrui told The New York Times in 1986. Instead, he publicly criticized Amin and fled Uganda. ''The Africans,'' a nine-part series that was originally broadcast by the BBC and later shown on PBS, portrayed Africa as having been defined by the interplay of indigenous, Islamic and Western influences. Professor Mazrui had acquired the perspective by growing up speaking Swahili, practicing Islam and attending an English-speaking school in Mombasa, Kenya. ''My three worlds overlapped,'' he said in the interview with The Times. The series glorified the Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi, saying he inspired Africans to have a sense of destiny and become actors on the world stage -- a stance that set off storms of criticism. In the last episode, Professor Mazrui predicted a ''final racial conflict'' in South Africa that would end with whites' shrinking from using nuclear weapons for fear of killing themselves and then being defeated in an armed struggle, ending apartheid. Victorious blacks, he said, would then inherit ''the most advanced nuclear infrastructure on the continent,'' and nuclear weapons would become a bargaining chip in a worldwide black-white struggle. He told The Los Angeles Times that he was ''uneasy'' that the United States and the Soviet Union could start a nuclear war, without Africa having the same capability. ''I want black Africa to have the bomb to frighten the system as a whole,'' he said. The National Endowment for the Humanities, which had contributed $600,000 toward the making of the series, was so upset with Professor Mazuri's message that it removed its name from the credits. Lynne Cheney, the chairwoman of the endowment, called the series ''worse than unbalanced,'' noting that it included no interviews giving divergent views. Professor Mazrui's answer to Mrs. Cheney was that he had intended from the beginning to represent the views of one African -- ''a view from the inside,'' he called it. ''There are many parts that are anti-imperialist,'' he told The New York Times. ''Africa is concerned with past domination and afraid of redomination.'' Reviewing the series for The Times, John Corry called its scholarship ''empty'' and said it was ''a vehicle solely for Mr. Mazrui's feelings.'' But Clifford Terry, writing in The Chicago Tribune, suggested that this personal perspective was in fact a strength: ''It is obvious, through it all, that here is a man who deeply cares about what he likes to call a 'remarkable continent.' '' Tom Shales of The Washington Post applauded the shows' abrasiveness. ''The alternative,'' he wrote, ''would be an innocuous, safely 'balanced' documentary on Africa that made no ripples, provoked no discourse.'' Ali Al'Amin Mazrui was born on Feb. 24, 1933, in Mombasa. His father was an eminent Muslim scholar and the chief Islamic judge of Kenya. As a boy he was not a good student and studied typing at a technical school. He stayed on at the school as a clerk and kept unsuccessfully applying to university, he said in a 2009 interview with The Observer, a Ugandan newspaper. The Observer reported that the governor of Kenya had heard him give a speech on the Prophet Muhammad's birthday and had been impressed. That led to a series of interviews and a scholarship to finish secondary school in England. He ended up earning a bachelor's degree from the University of Manchester, a master's from Columbia in New York and, in 1966, a doctorate from Oxford. The next year he published three books on African politics. In 1973, he began teaching at Makerere University in Uganda. When he fled Uganda, he went to the University of Michigan to teach political science. In addition to teaching at Binghamton, he held an at-large professorial appointment with Cornell and lectured at many schools around the world. He was president of the Association of Muslim Social Scientists of North America and president of the African Studies Association of the United States. He advised the United Nations and the World Bank. Professor Mazrui's marriage to the former Molly Vickerman ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Pauline Uti; his sons, Jamal, Alamin, Kim, Farid and Harith; his daughter, Grace Egbo-Mazrui; three grandchildren; and a sister, Alya. In editing ''The Africans'' for American television, Professor Mazrui deleted his description of Karl Marx as ''the last of the great Jewish prophets'' because producers feared it might be taken as anti-Semitic. In Britain, where the line was used, he had worried that Marxists might be offended by the reference to Marx as a prophet. ''My life,'' he once said, ''is one long debate.''"
12174,"Lord Wilberforce, 95, Keeper Of an Antislavery Tradition","Richard Orme Wilberforce, a retired member of Britain's highest court and keeper of his family's antislavery tradition, died on Saturday at a hospital in London.","Richard Orme Wilberforce, a retired member of Britain's highest court and keeper of his family's antislavery tradition, died on Saturday at a hospital in London. He was 95. He was a prominent judge in postwar Britain, known for handling both criminal and civil matters with a keen intellect, clarity and patient civility. Knighted in 1961, he was created a life peer and law lord three years later, when he became Lord Wilberforce, Baron of the City and County of Kingston-upon-Hull. Lord Wilberforce was a great-great-grandson of William Wilberforce (1759-1833), an English statesman associated with William Pitt the Younger, the great British prime minister. William Wilberforce was a religiously inspired antislavery politician who helped pave the way for the Abolition of Slavery Act of 1833. Three years ago his descendant, Lord Wilberforce, warned Parliament of a modern kind of ""bonded labor."" This, he declared, had taken the place of slavery that William Wilberforce had denounced in the House of Commons as early as the 1780's. He said that whereas people may be freed from chattel servitude by breaking their chains, modern bonded labor enmeshes them in a whole skein of complex economic and political circumstances. ""You have to provide a system of good employment, schools for the children, and some system of land reform so that people can earn a living,"" he told Parliament. ""Bonded labor certainly is servitude, and in many ways it is worse."" Richard Orme Wilberforce was raised in India, the son of a judge of the high court in Lahore under the Raj. He graduated from Oxford University and was called to the bar in 1932. His career as a barrister was interrupted by six years in the army in World War II. He served in Norway, France and Germany, earning the rank of brigadier and decorations that included a United States Bronze Star. He ended the war in the army's legal branch and was under secretary of the Control Office for Germany and Austria in 1945-46, helping to repeal Nazi-era legislation and set up a new legal framework. He started his judicial career in 1961 as an appointed High Court, or Chancery, judge. He was promoted directly to the House of Lords as a lord appeal in ordinary. Historically the House of Lords served as Britain's court of final resort but delegated that function to a committee of law lords, making it the country's highest tribunal. He contributed especially in the fields of international law, and administrative and commercial law. He was also remembered for issuing the judicial report ending the coal miners' strike that crippled Britain in the winter of 1971-72. After he retired from the law committee in 1982, Lord Wilberforce advocated human rights, legal reforms and a simpler legislative process. He also sought to inspire the judiciary to become more aware of social needs and imperatives when applying the law. His survivors include his wife of 55 years, Yvette Marie Lenoan, daughter of a French judge; a daughter, Anne Catherine Burn; and a son, Samuel Herbert."

Kallman, a Stanford University scientist who did early research on the effects of radiation on cancer cells, helping to establish the practice as a standard treatment, died on Aug. 8 at Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 81. The cause was lung disease, said his daughter, Robin Kallman. In the mid-50's, Dr. Kallman and a colleague helped demonstrate in mice that using radiation to fight tumors worked better when the cancerous cells had higher levels of oxygen, a phenomenon called reoxygenation. Their research, which Dr. Kallman pursued through most of his career, helped lead to a better understanding of radiation therapy. ""He showed that when radiation kills tumor cells, it is more effective to have a good oxygen supply,"" said Dr. Malcolm Bagshaw, an emeritus professor of radiation oncology at the Stanford School of Medicine. ""He was one of the first radiobiologists to study full time how radiation works as a method of killing tumors."" Dr. Kallman became head of the new radiobiology division at Stanford in the late 50's. After securing financing from the National Cancer Institute, he founded a cancer biology program which developed a national reputation. The program, which thrives today with about 50 graduate students and a half-dozen postdoctorate workers, has been emulated at Yale and other major universities, Dr. Bagshaw said. Born in Brooklyn in 1922, Robert Friend Kallman earned his bachelor's degree at Hofstra. He went to Europe as an Army medic in World War II, then earned his Ph.D. from New York University in 1952. He joined Stanford's department of radiology in 1956 and remained there until his retirement in 1992. He was president of the Radiation Research Society in 1976. Dr. Kallman's first wife, Frances Green, known as Pat, died in 1966. He is survived by his second wife, Ingrid; a son and daughter from his first marriage, Timothy, of Cabin John, Md., and Robin Kallman of San Francisco; a son from his second marriage, Lars, of Stanford; a brother, Raymond, of Taos, N.M.; a sister, Nancy Rudolph of New York City; two grandchildren; and several nieces and nephews."

Murbach, a horticulturist who added an impresario's flair to one of the biggest jobs in the world of trees and gardens -- finding the holiday tree for Rockefeller Center each year -- was found dead on Dec. 23 in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he had a home.","David P. Murbach, a horticulturist who added an impresario's flair to one of the biggest jobs in the world of trees and gardens -- finding the holiday tree for Rockefeller Center each year -- was found dead on Dec. 23 in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he had a home. He was 57. The cause was heart disease, said a longtime friend, Andre Dupuis, who found Mr. Murbach's body when he arrived for a visit. Rockefeller Center announced his death on Monday. For all the pleasure that the tree gave to holiday crowds that oohed and ahhed, it was a never-ending source of New York-style anxiety for the man who selected it for 26 years. ''It's on my mind every single day of the year,'' Mr. Murbach said in 1994. The ''it'' referred to what he turned into a year-round assignment: finding the perfect tree, somewhere, generally within a few hundred miles. ''When I'm at the nursery shopping for Easter lilies, I'm looking for a tree,'' he said. ''When I'm going to the beach in the summer, I'm looking for a tree.'' Of course, there are no spruces on the beach in East Hampton, N.Y., where he lived. But even there his mind was on the tree. He knew what he wanted: tallness (70 to 80 feet), fullness (seven and a half tons or so) and shapeliness (triangular branches, evenly spaced). As the manager of the gardens division at Rockefeller Center, Mr. Murbach went about finding a tree the way a casting director would look for an actor for a particular role in a play. ''You want personality: there's density, a height and a width that we need,'' he said, ''but some trees have a way of holding their branches. I don't know what else to call it but character.'' He rented helicopters to scout trees from above. One year he zipped off to see a tree whose worried owners were afraid it would fall on their house. He liked what he saw, and soon the tree was on the way to Manhattan. Another year, a woman told her husband the tree in the yard had to go -- and it went to Rockefeller Center after Mr. Murbach took a look. It arrived in Manhattan by barge after a two-day ride down the Hudson River that Mr. Murbach had stage-managed, down to checking tide charts for New York Harbor. ''Every last detail mattered: the size of the trunk, the span of the breadth of the tree, the needles -- were they soft or were they hard?'' said Thomas A. Madden Jr., the managing director of Rockefeller Center, who went along after Mr. Murbach had narrowed the annual search to the finalists. ''It was always his decision,'' Mr. Madden said. ''I was more or less the one who was there to say, 'Yeah, Dave, you're right again.' '' Mr. Murbach also looked after one of the world's best-known urban gardens; Rockefeller Center has a couple of small parks, a handful of plazas, the famed Channel Gardens and more than a dozen office-building lobbies. Sometimes, he once said, he did not figure out exactly what to do until the plants he had ordered were actually delivered. Some years there were a lot of trucks and a lot of plants: he could easily find room for 10,000. ''He wasn't simply a designer,'' said Gregory Long, the president of the New York Botanical Garden. ''He was more than that; he was a plantsman, someone who understands them, and that was a marvelous combination, season after season, year after year.'' David Paul Murbach was born on July 19, 1952, in Amityville, N.Y., and grew up in nearby Merrick. He graduated from the University of Arizona with a degree in natural-resource planning and horticulture in 1974 and spent seven years supervising the gardens at a private estate on Long Island. He earned a master's degree in ornamental horticulture from the University of Delaware in 1984 while working at the Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pa., an arboretum that was largely the handiwork of Pierre S. du Pont. In New York he was a founder of the Metro Hort Group, an association of professional horticulturists. Mr. Murbach is survived by a sister, Carol Wendy Murbach, of Merrick, N.Y., and a brother, Jonathan, of Ormond Beach, Fla. As a boy Mr. Murbach had visited his father's law office -- in Rockefeller Center, with windows that looked down on the Fifth Avenue roof gardens. Years later, while finishing his graduate work in Delaware, Mr. Murbach saw a classified ad and applied for the horticulturist's job. One of his first projects was to restore those same gardens by replacing the hedges and resodding the lawns. He used old photographs as a guide and had tons of new soil hauled up, bucket by bucket, in the elevators."
59084,Col. John Boyd Is Dead at 70; Advanced Air Combat Tactics,"Col. John R. Boyd, a legendary Air Force fighter pilot whose discovery that quicker is better than faster became the basis of a far-reaching theory that helped revolutionize American military strategy, died on March 9 at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla.","Col. John R. Boyd, a legendary Air Force fighter pilot whose discovery that quicker is better than faster became the basis of a far-reaching theory that helped revolutionize American military strategy, died on March 9 at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 70 and had lived in Delray Beach. The cause was cancer, his family said. To combat pilots of the late 1950's, it was always high noon in the skies above the Nevada desert. A pilot, a crack instructor at Nellis Air Force Base, perhaps, or a hotshot Navy flier passing through would get on the radio to call him out and within minutes Colonel Boyd would have another notch in his belt. They did not call him 40-second Boyd for nothing. From 1954 to 1960 virtually every combat pilot in the country knew that Colonel Boyd, a former Korean War pilot who helped establish the Fighter Weapons School at Nellis, had a standing offer: take a position on his tail, and 40 twisting, turning seconds later he would have the challenger in his own gun-sights or pay $40. Colonel Boyd never lost the bet in more than 3,000 hours of flying time. A high school swimming champion who won an athletic scholarship to the University of Iowa, Colonel Boyd, a native of Erie, Pa., had superior reflexes and hand-eye coordination, but what made him invincible in mock combat was something else. At Nellis he taught himself calculus so he could work out the formulas that produced his repertory of aerial maneuvers and led to his 1960 report, ""Aerial Attack Study,"" the bible of air-to-air combat. His combat experience was limited to a few missions in Korea, but they were enough to produce a breakthrough insight. Wondering why the comparatively slow and ponderous American F-86's achieved near total domination of the superior MIG-15's, he realized that the F-86 had two crucial advantages: better visibility and a faster roll rate. This, in turn, led Colonel Boyd to develop what he called the OODA Loop, to denote the repeated cycle of observation, orientation, decision and action that characterized every encounter. The key to victory, he theorized, was not a plane that could climb faster or higher but one that could begin climbing or change course quicker -- to get inside an adversary's ""time/cycle loop."" The fast-cycle combat theory, expanded by Colonel Boyd into a lecture he later delivered hundreds of times, has since been widely applied to fields as diverse as weapons procurement, battlefield strategy and business competition. One implication of the theory was that the best fighter plane was not necessarily the one with the most speed, firepower or range. Colonel Boyd, who enrolled at Georgia Tech after his Nellis tour, was helping a fellow student with his homework over hamburgers and beer one night when he had an insight that led to a way to quantify his ideas. The resulting Energy Maneuverability Theory, which allows precise comparisons of maneuverability, is now a standard measure of aerial performance. Assigned to the Pentagon in 1964, Colonel Boyd became an important figure in a movement that started in response to $400 hammers and other headline excesses of Defense Department spending and soon expanded to question the need for many hugely expensive weapons systems. Although he had allies in the Pentagon, Congress and business, Colonel Boyd's ideas often went against the grain of a military-industrial bureaucracy devoted to the procurement of the most advanced, most expensive and (not coincidentally, he felt) most profitable planes. Although his design ideas helped give the F-15 a big, high-visibility canopy, his major triumph was the F-16, a plane lacking many of the F-15's high-tech, expensive features, but which is far more agile and costs less than half as much, allowing for the purchase of many more of them for a given expenditure. Top Air Force officers were so opposed to the concept of producing a plane that did not expand on the F-15's cutting edge technology that Colonel Boyd and some civilian allies developed it in secret. The plane was hailed for its performance in the Persian Gulf war, a war whose very strategy of quick, flexible response was based largely on ideas Colonel Boyd had been promoting for years. Colonel Boyd, who maintained that the lure of big-money defense contracts invariably perverted weapons assessment, was so personally fastidious that during his years in the Pentagon be became known as the Ghetto Colonel because he lived in a basement apartment. He carried his notion of propriety to such an extreme that when he retired in 1975 and began some of his most productive work, as a Pentagon consultant, he insisted that his family live on his retirement pay. Initially offering to work full time without pay, he was persuaded to accept one day's pay every two-week pay period, because he had to be on the Pentagon payroll to have access to the building, before retiring in 1988. He is survived by his wife, Mary; three sons, Stephen, of Springfield, Va., Scott, of Burke, Va., and Jeff, of Delray Beach, Fla.; two daughters, Kathryn, of Delray Beach and Mary Ellen Holton of Centerville, Va.; a brother, H. G. Boyd of Pompano Beach, Fla.; a sister, Marion Boyd of Erie, and two grandchildren."

20124,"Richard Popkin, 81, Historian Of Philosophy and Skepticism","Dr. Richard Henry Popkin, a historian of philosophy and its particular tradition of skeptical thought, died on Thursday at a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif.","Dr. Richard Henry Popkin, a historian of philosophy and its particular tradition of skeptical thought, died on Thursday at a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 81 and lived in Los Angeles. The cause was complications of emphysema, his family said. Skepticism, a hallmark of Western philosophy since ancient Greece, is an attitude of systematic questioning, not philosophical dogmatism or zealotry. Dr. Popkin wrote a history of skepticism that appeared in 1960. It included thinkers like Descartes and Spinoza as it went through editions and revisions. He expanded the work to ''The History of Scepticism From Savonarola to Bayle,'' now in its second edition, published by the Oxford University Press in 2003. The author documents an era pivotal to Western thought, an age of doubt as well as faith. Besides numerous articles and book chapters, Dr. Popkin wrote and edited 36 books, often in collaboration with others. Among the many still in print are a paperback, ''Spinoza,'' published in England last year, as well as ''Third Force in 17th-Century Thought'' (1991) and ''Skeptical Philosophy for Everyone'' (2001), written with Avrum Stoll. He was the editor of the Columbia History of Western Philosophy, published by the Columbia University Press in 1999, and ''Jewish Christians and Christian Jews: From the Renaissance to the Enlightenment'' (1993). Also in print is ''Scepticism and Irreligion in the 17th and 18th Centuries'' (1993), which he edited with Arjo Vanderjagt. Forswearing philosophy for a spell in the 1960's, Dr. Popkin joined the chorus of doubters who prominently disputed the Warren Commission Report on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In an article in The New York Review of Books and in a paperback he argued that the commission's single-assassin solution was not just implausible, but also impossible in terms of the commission's evidence. The book, ''The Second Oswald'' (Avon, 1966), promptly came under attack. Eliot Fremont-Smith, in a review in The New York Times, called it ''a very hasty book, but fascinating reading.'' At his death, Dr. Popkin was working on a book about Rabbi Isaac of Troki in Lithuania, who composed a polemic against Christianity in the 16th century, and a collection of essays on philosophical skepticism. Dr. Popkin was born in Manhattan. He graduated in 1943 from Columbia University, where he also received a master's in 1945 and a doctorate in 1950. He started teaching philosophy as an instructor at the University of Connecticut in the 1940's. Other positions followed, and he was a professor of philosophy at the University of California, San Diego, from 1963 to 1973. He was a professor of philosophy and Jewish studies at Washington University in St. Louis from 1973 to 1986 and was more recently affiliated as an adjunct professor with the University of California, Los Angeles. Surviving are his wife of 60 years, Juliet Greenstone Popkin; a son, Dr. Jeremy D. Popkin of Lexington, Ky.; two daughters, Margaret L. Popkin of Silver Spring, Md., and Dr. Susan J.

45206,Sheik Gad al-Haq Dies at 78; Influential Egyptian Cleric,"Sheik Gad al-Haq Ali Gad al-Haq, an influential voice of conservative Islam who headed Egypt's highest religious authority, died of a heart attack on Friday at his home in Cairo.","CAIRO, March 16 Sheik Gad al-Haq Ali Gad al-Haq, an influential voice of conservative Islam who headed Egypt's highest religious authority, died of a heart attack on Friday at his home in Cairo. He was 78. As the grand sheik of Al Azhar, one of the Muslim world's oldest and most renowned religious institutions, Sheik Gad al-Haq was a source of support and frustration for Egypt's secular Government during a time of deepening religious sentiment in the country. Appointed to the post in 1982 by President Hosni Mubarak, Sheik Gad al-Haq spoke out strongly against the Muslim militants who have waged a violent campaign to overthrow the Government. But he also left officials vexed by issuing rulings that contravened Government policy by endorsing female circumcision and condemning travel to Israel. The influence of Al Azhar extends well beyond Egypt, and the death of Sheik Gad al-Haq could leave President Mubarak with a difficult decision as he seeks to install a successor acceptable to conservative Muslims but unlikely to undermine the Government's authority. In a statement on Friday, the President gave no hint of any strain between his Government and the cleric. He praised Sheik Gad al-Haq for preserving Al Azhar as ""a podium for moderate, correct Islam that attracts the hearts of scholars, intellectuals and ordinary Muslims."" Born April 5, 1917, in the Nile Delta province of Daqahliya, Sheik Gad al-Haq received his diploma of higher learning from Al Azhar in 1945. He served as an assistant to the mufti of Egypt and as a judge of Islamic law, and beginning in 1960 was a member of the Egyptian Higher Council for Islamic Affairs. Since 1978, when he was appointed mufti -- considered the top Government post for religious scholars -- he was widely recognized as a powerful conservative force, and as grand sheik of Al Azhar eclipsed the current mufti, Dr. Mohammed Said Tantawi, by hewing to a strict line of Muslim orthodoxy. Among his many disagreements with Dr. Tantawi and others among the Government's religious authorities were over questions about the permissibility of organ transplants and the charging of interest on loans. Both are legal in Egypt, but Sheik Gad al-Haq argued that neither was acceptable under Islamic strictures. He also attracted international attention for his conservative stands during United Nations conferences in 1994 and 1995. He spoke out vehemently against the United Nations population conference held in Egypt in 1994, criticizing participants for what he said was their acceptance of homosexual families, premarital sex and abortion. A month after that gathering, he issued a ruling that female genital mutilation, sometimes called female circumcision, was an Islamic duty. That opinion that was strongly denounced by women's rights advocates and others in Egypt, including some who argued that the practice had African rather than Islamic roots. Sheik Gad al-Haq similarly condemned the United Nations women's conference held in Beijing in 1995, saying its effect was to undermine morality by conveying support for homosexuality and extramarital sex. Under Sheik Gad al-Haq, Al Azhar maintained its decades-long ban on a novel, ""Children of Gebelawi,"" by the Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz, which the institution has said is heretical because it includes characters who clearly resemble figures from the Koran and the Bible. Earlier this year, the cleric put Al Azhar on the side of some of the world's strictest Islamic Governments by demanding tough punishment for Muslims who eat or drink in public during the holy month of Ramadan. The authorities in countries like Saudi Arabia have long enforced the religious laws that require daytime fasting during Ramadan, but this has not been done in Egypt, which has a reputation for greater religious tolerance. Even so, Sheik Gad al-Haq was never embraced by the Muslim militants who are trying to replace Egypt's secular Government with an Islamic state. They regarded him as too close to the Government, which they believed had co-opted Al Azhar, and he in turn made clear that he regarded those who have waged the campaign of violence not as Muslims but as common criminals. On Friday, the depth of his more mainstream following was evident as thousands took part in his funeral at the 1,000-year-old Al Azhar mosque, where policemen and soldiers wielding automatic weapons blocked roads to provide security for Government ministers and Islamic and Coptic religious leaders. The sheik's wooden coffin was draped in an Egyptian flag, and mourners rushed to touch it as his body was borne from the mosque, while others shouted, ""Gad al-Haq is the beloved of God."" In front-page accounts today, Egyptian newspapers said he had died suddenly in the early hours of Friday morning as he prepared for night prayers. Among those who sent messages of condolence to President Mubarak were King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and Pope Shenuda III, the head of the Cairo-based Coptic Christian church. Sheik Gad al-Haq is survived by his wife and three sons, Egyptian newspapers said."

He was 77 years old. Mr. Parks, who was recently found to have an inoperable lung disease, died in his sleep at Scripps Memorial Hospital, said Mark Howell, a family friend. Best known for his 25 years as the host of the Miss America Pageant, he also worked widely in radio, television and films. His stage credits include the starring role in a Broadway production of the ""The Music Man."" Mr. Parks, who was born in Atlanta, began his career while still very young. He landed his first job in radio, as a singer on the ""Eddie Cantor Show."" He later worked as a staff announcer for CBS from 1933 until 1939. His big break came in 1945, when he landed the job of host on the radio quiz show ""Break the Bank."" He gained wider fame on radio beginning in 1948 as the host of ""Stop the Music."" Moving to Television Both radio shows soon moved to television, taking Mr. Parks with them. Before long, he was seen in daytime on quiz shows and in prime time on nine different shows. He was the host ""Double or Nothing"" from 1953 to 1955. But it was as the tuxedo-clad crooner serenading Miss Americas in Atlantic City that he became known to millions. In 1980, pageant officials dropped Mr. Parks as host, saying they wanted to give the show a younger look. The dismissal generated nationwide sympathy for Mr. Parks, and Johnny Carson organized a letter-writing campaign. Mr. Parks made a special return appearance in 1990, when he again sang his signature song. He received a standing ovation when he walked onstage. Mr. Parks played himself in the 1990 film comedy ""The Freshman,"" with Marlon Brando. In a sendup of his own beauty-pageant performances, he serenaded a giant endangered lizard that was to be served as the main course of a banquet. Mr. Parks also had a career in television drama. He began to act in the 1960's, making guest appearances on ""Burke's Law,"" and in the 70's on ""Ellery Queen"" and ""The Bionic Woman."" He also appeared as ringmaster of the syndicated ""Circus"" series in the early 1970's. He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Annette; twin sons, Joel and Jeffrey; a daughter, Annette Jr., and two grandchildren."
46920,"Reggie Fleming, Hockey Player Known for Physical Style, Dies at 73","Reggie Fleming, one of the National Hockey League's toughest players in the 1960s, died Saturday in a suburban Chicago hospital.","Reggie Fleming, one of the National Hockey League's toughest players in the 1960s, died Saturday in a suburban Chicago hospital. He was 73. Fleming had been in declining health after having a stroke and heart attack five years ago, his son, Chris Fleming, said. Fleming spent 12 full seasons in the N.H.L. from 1960 to 1971, playing 749 games, scoring 108 goals and compiling 1,468 penalty minutes. During his stint with the Rangers from 1966 through 1970, he spent so much time in the Madison Square Garden penalty box, he told John Halligan, the team's longtime public-relations director, that ''I got my mail delivered there.'' He was a fan favorite in the cities where he played, including six in the N.H.L. Although renowned for his willingness and ability to fight, Fleming was also versatile enough to be used as a defenseman and as a forward, shutting down star players on the other team. With the Chicago Blackhawks in 1960-61, his first full season in the N.H.L., he scored one of the most important goals in club history. The Blackhawks were leading the Stanley Cup finals against Detroit, three games to two, but trailing in Game 6, 1-0. Fleming, assigned to check Gordie Howe, stole the puck in the Red Wings' end and scored. That goal changed the momentum, enabling the Blackhawks to win the game and the series -- the third and most recent Stanley Cup title in team history. ''The one that I really see clearly in my mind is Reggie Fleming, who scored the first goal in the game that we beat Detroit for the Cup,'' a teammate, Pierre Pilote, said this year about his memories from that game. ''I can still see him celebrating.'' Fleming was born in the east end of Montreal where, as an only child, he lived with his parents, grandparents and nine uncles and aunts. Growing up English in a mostly French neighborhood, he frequently got into fights. As a teenager playing with the Montreal Junior Canadiens, his coach, Sam Pollock, asked Fleming to fight often. ''I was going to tell Pollock to stop using my child this way,'' Fleming's mother, Julie, said in a 1975 article in The Canadian magazine, ''but Reggie told me: 'Mother, don't. It's my job, what I'm supposed to do, it's the only way I'll make it.' '' Fleming told Earl McRae, who wrote the article, about his start with the Blackhawks. ''My first game in Chicago, there was a brawl and I just sort of watched,'' Fleming said. ''In the dressing room, Rudy Pilous, he was our coach, he said: 'Fleming, if your buddies are in trouble, don't just stand there. Your job is to help them out, fight for them. If you don't, you might as well pack your bag, you're no use to us.' So I went out and fought. That was always my job, eh? I didn't do it to be cruel; I was just following orders.'' Fleming also played forMontreal, Boston, Philadelphia and Buffalo in the N.H.L., for Chicago in the World Hockey Association and for several minor league teams before retiring at 41. In addition to his son, Fleming is survived by a daughter, Kelly, according to The Chicago Tribune. Fleming, who was nicknamed Mr. Clean for his muscular build and severe crew cut, was confined to bed during the last five years because of complications arising from a stroke. His son posted several videos on YouTube in which his father reminisced about his life from his hospital bed. In one, Fleming told his son why, after his hockey career was over, he settled in Chicago. Was it because he had won his only Stanley Cup there? ''The people, their friendliness,'' Fleming said. ''Their comfort. They made it easy for me to make a living.''"

That first bite of the fruit was built on a lie. Mr. Rosenblat, who died on Feb. 5 at a hospital in Aventura, Fla., wrote a moving but largely unexceptional Holocaust memoir in 1993. What distinguished it was one scene: a momentary encounter in a snow-dappled field in Germany between a starving teenage inmate at Schlieben, a subcamp of Buchenwald, and a young girl watching him from the other side of a barbed wire fence. According to his own story, as recounted in another book: ''He saw her pull something from her pocket. An apple? She squinted, gauging the distance between them, swung her arm in a few practice throws, then hurled the apple with a force that surprised him. The fruit flew across most of the distance between them before it dropped to the ground, rolled under the fence and landed just inches beyond the wire on Herman's side.'' Twelve years later, he recognized that same young girl as the woman with whom he was on a blind date in Coney Island, after she recounted her version of the story. '' 'That boy was me,' Herman said,'' Penelope J. Holt wrote in ''The Apple,'' ''and he smiled at the beautiful angel by his side.'' This Holocaust story had a happy ending. The couple wed and remained married for more than 56 years. Except that the story, as Herman Rosenblat told it, was not true. After appearing on ''Oprah'' in 2007 and presenting Roma Radzicki Rosenblat, the woman he met on the blind date in Coney Island, with a ring from J. C. Penney to mark their 50th wedding anniversary, Mr. Rosenblatt acknowledged, ''The reality was that I wasn't telling the truth, because she didn't throw the apple to me, but in my mind I believed she did.'' His ''Angel at the Fence,'' which Berkley Books was to publish on Valentine's Day in 2009, was never released. A feature film inspired by the book was also scrubbed. What Ms. Winfrey had hailed as ''the single greatest love story'' she had ever heard proved instead to have been a hoax. Mr. Rosenblat died at 85 after undergoing heart surgery, his son, Kenneth, said. Besides his son and his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Renee Enea, and three grandchildren. He was born on Sept. 23, 1929, in Poland, where his parents ran a store. Much of the memoir of his family's frightful persecution by the Nazi invaders may have been true. His father died of typhus. When he was 12, Herman and his siblings were herded into ghettos and camps where he and his three brothers managed to stay together for six years. His mother was separated for ''processing'' and apparently killed. He said he moved to America in 1950, and seven years later he did meet Roma on a blind date. He later explained that he had written his memoir because, while he was hospitalized for the gunshot wound he suffered in the 1992 robbery, ''my mother came to me in a dream and said that I must tell my story so that my grandchildren would know of our survival from the Holocaust.'' But what led him to embellish the story is anybody's guess. In 1995, he submitted an abridged version to a New York Post love-story contest. It was also featured in ''Chicken Soup for the Soul'' and stirred Ms. Winfrey, the film producer Harris Salomon and the literary agent Andrea Hurst. Mr. Rosenblat received a book advance of about $50,000 and about $100,000 more for the film rights (neither of which, apparently, was ever returned). He even accompanied Mr. Salomon to Auschwitz, where he not only re-enacted the apple-tossing encounter on camera but further embroidered his account, this time recalling that the young girl returned ''every day'' to deliver more apples. But after Holocaust scholars, several infuriated relatives and a reporter for The New Republic concluded that the story had been concocted, Mr. Rosenblat admitted that the apple was in his mind's eye. Ms. Winfrey said she was ''disappointed.'' His collaborators said they had been duped. ''I wanted to bring happiness to people, to remind them not to hate but to love and tolerate all people,'' he said. ''I brought good feelings to a lot of people and I brought hope to many. My motivation was to make good in this world. In my dreams, Roma will always throw me an apple, but I now know it is only a dream.'' In Ms. Holt's 2009 book, ''The Apple: Based on the Herman Rosenblat Holocaust Memoir,'' in which certain incidents were fictionalized, he is quoted as saying: ''When I met Roma, after the war, she told me that one time she had thrown an apple to a little Jewish boy, and I thought that this could have been me. I wanted it to be me.'' ''He cemented Roma into a corner of his gruesome survivor account and honored her with the love story that she deserved,'' Ms. Holt wrote. In fact, during the war Roma and her family, who were Jewish, were passing as Roman Catholics, living with a Polish family 200 miles away. She had never tossed an apple to anyone. ''I don't know why he lied, but if you can't trust a Holocaust survivor, who can you trust?'' Mr. Salomon said in an interview, suggesting that Mr. Rosenblat's motivation was less likely money than vanity and that, for whatever reason, most of his immediate family was complicit. ''Herman liked being in the limelight. He also needed a hook, something to separate his Holocaust story from all the others.'' He had told his story so many times that perhaps he had even persuaded himself that the woman he married was the same young girl he imagined had salved the hunger of a starving teenager across the barbed wire barricade of a concentration camp. ''In my imagination, in my mind, I believed it,'' he told ''Good Morning America.'' ''Even now, I believe it, that she was there and she threw the apple to me.''"

She was 75 years old. Miss Ashton-Warner's first book, ''Spinster,'' which was published in 1959 and became an international best seller, described with humor the antics of her pupils and the life of a teacher who, though she tried to marry, finally realized: ''The truth is that I am enslaved. I'm enslaved in one vast love affair with seventy children.'' ''Spinster'' later became a film called ''Two Loves,'' starring Shirley MacLaine. Taught Maori Children In an autobiographical account published in 1963 called ''Teacher,'' Miss Ashton-Warner recounted 24 years spent in an ''Infant School'' teaching children of the Maori - a once primitive people now caught between two cultures. ''I see the mind of the 5-year-old as a volcano with two vents; destructiveness and creativeness,'' she wrote. She said that she sought to quell the children's destructiveness and fuel their creativity through unconventional means. Miss Ashton-Warner was born in Stratford, New Zealand, in 1908. She never attended college. She married a school headmaster, Keith Henderson, and together they taught in the New Zealand country schools for more than 20 years.

She was 88 years old. Miss Lopokova trained at the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, where she was born, and joined the Diaghilev company in 1910, making her debut in the title role of ''The Firebird.'' She danced Columbine in ''Carnaval,'' the Ballerina in ''Petrouchka'' and Aurora and the Lilac Fairy in ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' and she created the roles of Mariuccia in ''The Good-Humored Ladies,'' the Can-Can Dancer in ''La Boutique Fantasque'' and an Acrobat in ''Parade.'' Miss Lopokova danced with the Diaghilev company intermittently into the late 20's, appearing also in musical comedy in the United States. Later, she toured with small ensembles and danced occasionally with ballet companies, appearing as Swanilda and in the Tango of the Vic-Wells, later Royal, Ballet's productions of ''Coppelia'' and ''Facade.'' Miss Lopokova's first marriage, to Randolpho Barrocchi, at one time a business manager for the Diaghilev company, ended in divorce. She was engaged to Heywood Broun, drama critic of The New York Tribune, but in 1925 she was married to John Maynard, later Lord, Keynes, the economist and a member of the Bloomsbury group. He died in 1946. Known for Comic Gifts After her marriage to Lord Keynes, she danced only occasionally. She appeared in English productions of plays by Shakespeare, Ibsen and Moliere, but her dramatic career was hampered by her strong Russian accent. In 1930, she helped to found the Camargo Society, a London group established to further ballet, and, with her husband, the Cambridge Arts Theater in 1936. With her round face, snub nose and short stature, Miss Lopokova was primarily a demi-caractere ballerina and was admired for her exuberant gaiety and comic gifts, both on and off stage. ''To publish an interview with Lydia Lopokova, will-o'-the-wisp dancer, without recording the charm of her Russian plus French plus Italian version of the English tongue,'' an American reporter wrote in 1921, ''is as futile as an attempt to paint a convincing sunset in India ink. Miss Lopokova says many interesting things, it is true, but no one would care if she didn't. Her utter lack of self-consciousness, her swift moving grace, her rippling voice with its piquant inflections, her mobile face and hands, and the aura of light and movement that surrounds her give such an amount of esthetic pleasure that mere ideas lost caste by comparison.''"

He was 83. The cause was heart failure, his son David said. Introduced in 1965, SpaghettiOs has been a fixture in the American pantry ever since. Its memorable advertising jingle -- ''Uh-oh, SpaghettiOs!'' -- sung by the pop singer Jimmie Rodgers, is indelibly lodged in the public consciousness. More than 150 million cans of SpaghettiOs are sold each year, a spokeswoman for Campbell, based in Camden, N.J., said Wednesday. Mr. Goerke, who worked for Campbell from 1955 until he retired in 1990, also created the company's Chunky soup line. Donald Edward Goerke was born in Waukesha, Wis., on Aug. 8, 1926. (The family name is pronounced GUR-key.) He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from what was then Carroll College in Waukesha and an M.B.A. from the University of Wisconsin. Besides his son David, Mr. Goerke is survived by another son, Brian; a daughter, Ann Nassoura; a brother, Fred; and seven grandchildren. His wife, the former June Marie Uthus, died in 2008. Mr. Goerke was a marketing manager with Franco-American, then a division of Campbell, when he was asked to supervise the development of a new canned pasta for children. The shape was crucial on two counts. The first was durability: it had to withstand canning and reheating. The second was damage control: long pasta and young children mix dangerously, with child, chair and walls ending up beribboned with dripping strands. A simple ''O,'' Mr. Goerke realized, would solve both problems. Its stable shape allowed a thinner strand of pasta to be used, making the reheated product less gummy. It also fit tidily in the bowl of a spoon. Shapes considered and rejected by Mr. Goerke's team included baseballs, cowboys, spacemen and stars."

It was April 11, 1945, and Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army had liberated the concentration camp scarcely an hour before. Rabbi Schacter, who was attached to the Third Army's VIII Corps, was the first Jewish chaplain to enter in its wake. That morning, after learning that Patton's forward tanks had arrived at the camp, Rabbi Schacter, who died in the Riverdale section of the Bronx on Thursday at 95 after a career as one of the most prominent Modern Orthodox rabbis in the United States, commandeered a jeep and driver. He left headquarters and sped toward Buchenwald. By late afternoon, when the rabbi drove through the gates, Allied tanks had breached the camp. He remembered, he later said, the sting of smoke in his eyes, the smell of burning flesh and the hundreds of bodies strewn everywhere. He would remain at Buchenwald for months, tending to survivors, leading religious services in a former Nazi recreation hall and eventually helping to resettle thousands of Jews. For his work, Rabbi Schacter was singled out by name on Friday by Yisrael Meir Lau, the former Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel, in a meeting with President Obama at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial. In Buchenwald that April day, Rabbi Schacter said afterward, it seemed as though there was no one left alive. In the camp, he encountered a young American lieutenant who knew his way around. ''Are there any Jews alive here?'' the rabbi asked him. He was led to the Kleine Lager, or Little Camp, a smaller camp within the larger one. There, in filthy barracks, men lay on raw wooden planks stacked from floor to ceiling. They stared down at the rabbi, in his unfamiliar military uniform, with unmistakable fright.

The author was born Annie Winifred Ellerman in Margate, England, on Sept. 2, 1894, the daughter of a shipping magnate. Because she spent some of her happiest childhood moments on the island of Bryher, one of the Scillys, off Cornwall, she legally changed her name in the 1920's to Mrs. Winifred Bryher, later dropping her first name for literary purposes. For almost 40 years Mrs. Bryher lived with Hilda Doolittle, the Imagist poet and a distant cousin who died in 1961 at the age of 75. Mrs. Bryher helped to raise Miss Doolittle's daughter, Perdita, now Mrs. John Schaffner of New York, who became Mrs. Bryher's adopted daughter and heir.

""Cesar was loved and detested,"" Le Monde wrote on Monday. Only late in life was he embraced by the French cultural establishment: he was France's representative at the 1995 Venice Biennale (where he showed a monument of crushed cars); and his first retrospective in a French museum was not held until last year, at the Jeu de Paume. By then, however, the work by the stocky, bearded artist had begun to look dated. ""His love of life and good humor barely disguised his anxiety and his legitimate desire to be recognized as one of the great sculptors of his time,"" Jack Lang, a former French Culture Minister, said. Cesar's harshest critics said that he was obsessed with self-promotion, yet he seemingly felt that he had not won the appreciation that he deserved. He once complained that he never had an art dealer to promote him in the United States and that he had not been properly recognized in Paris. At least two of his sculptures are nonetheless seen daily by thousands of Parisians: a large equestrianlike statue, ""Centaur -- Homage to Picasso,"" which stands on Rue du Cherche-Midi along the Left Bank; and ""La Pouce,"" a 40-foot-high reproduction of his thumb at La Defense in western Paris. Born in Marseilles to Italian immigrant parents, Cesar left school at 12 to help his father make casks, but at 15 he began night classes at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Marseilles. Six years later, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he lived for the rest of his life. Working first with plaster and iron, then with lead, wire and ceramics, he was initially influenced by the likes of Brancusi, Picasso, Giacometti and Germaine Richier. But in the early 1950's, when he was too poor to buy materials, he was delighted to discover the potential offered by scrap iron. ""You can find it anywhere and buy it for almost nothing,"" he later explained. He began by creating what became known as his beastiary, a series of fish, animals and insects made of scrap iron that earned him an invitation to exhibit at the 1956 Venice Biennale. It was in 1960, though, that he presented his first crushed cars at the Salon de Mai, provoking an outcry from many French art critics. ""People thought I did it so I'd be talked about, because I was a 'provocateur,' "" he recalled, although conceding that it was a form of rebellion to present ""such an aggressive object."" These works led him to be associated with the New Realists. In the 1960's, when one art critic described him as a ""modern predator of industrial folklore,"" he saw his work as going in three directions: ""compression"" (cars), ""expansion"" (multicolored lavalike sculptures made of polyurethane) and ""prints"" (""La Pouce"" or an enlarged breast). In 1976, he gained still greater renown in an unexpected way: he was commissioned to create the trophy for a new French equivalent of the Oscar film awards, the Cesar. ""He loved cinema and he liked being its symbol,"" said Daniel Toscan du Plantier, who heads France's movie industry academy."

He was 90. He died of natural causes, his granddaughter, Madeline Burford, said. Working mostly in oil -- but also in prints, engravings, acrylics and even hot wax on canvas -- Mr. Burford suffused his creations with sometimes muted shades but more often with glowing colors. He focused on poignant moments: Southern blacks toiling in the fields; beachcombers gazing into the distance; jazz musicians reaching for high notes; a World War I soldier recovering in the hospital; a forlorn bicyclist standing by the side of the road, out of the race. But Mr. Burford was perhaps best known for depicting circus life. Among his many works are whip-cracking lion tamers, midflight trapeze artists, feather-bedecked ladies riding high on elephants, and sideshow attractions like the tattooed man, the bearded lady and the two-headed dog. When some of Mr. Burford's paintings were shown at a gallery in Manhattan in 1966, Hilton Kramer wrote in The New York Times that ''motifs drawn from carnival and circus life, from popular culture and nostalgic glimpses of forgotten wars are transformed into graphic symbols of a notable complexity.'' He added, ''There is no mistaking the fact that a genuine and interesting imagination has been engaged.'' Mr. Burford's works are in the collections of, among other institutions, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the University of Iowa Art Gallery. Byron Leslie Burford Jr. was born in Jackson, Miss., on July 12, 1920, to Byron and Floy Smith Burford, and grew up in Greenville, Miss. His father, who was director of the local Y.M.C.A., booked the circuses and carnivals that came to town. Byron Jr. combined his artistic talent with a fascination with those unusual performers and, at 14, went on the road with the Tom Mix Circus, hauling and painting. After graduating from high school, Mr. Burford enrolled at the University of Iowa, where his mentor was Grant Wood, the famous painter of rural America. He graduated in 1942, served in the Army Air Corps during World War II and returned to the University of Iowa, where he received a master's in fine arts in 1947. At Mr. Wood's behest, he was hired to teach painting at the university, which he did for 38 years. In addition to his granddaughter, Mr. Burford is survived by his son, Kevin, and two daughters, Nana Burford and Kathy Burford Lewis. His wife of 65 years, the former Kathleen Kane, died in 2009. During summer recesses throughout his academic career, Mr. Burford would go on the road with traveling circuses, playing drums in the band and, of course, painting. Online Correction: June 27, 2011, Monday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version misstated the given name of Mr. Burford's mother. It is Floy, not Flory. It also misstated the name of his late wife. It is Kathleen Kane, not Mary Dell."
36167,"MALCOLM PERRINE MCNAIR, 90, RETAILING EXPERT AT HARVARD","Malcolm Perrine McNair, a former professor at the Harvard Business School who developed a retail inventory method now in wide use, died yesterday at the Memorial Hospital in North Conway, N.H.","Malcolm Perrine McNair, a former professor at the Harvard Business School who developed a retail inventory method now in wide use, died yesterday at the Memorial Hospital in North Conway, N.H. He was 90 years old and lived in Madison, N.H. Mr. McNair, a Shakespeare scholar by training, was best known for the method he developed in the 1920's for keeping track of a large retail store's inventory and calculating its profitability. The system, described in the 1925 book ''The Retail Method of Inventory,'' depends on the store's ability to calculate at the outset the price it expects to get by selling a product. The company can then keep track of gross profit by subtracting the cost of obtaining the merchandise from the sale price. The method allows retailers to calculate the value of inventory so they will know if there will be enough cash available to purchase additional merchandise. It also allows the retailer to calculate more frequently than annually what the gross profit of the enterprise is without undertaking the arduous job of counting the merchandise. Theory on Innovation Mr. McNair was also known for developing a principal explanation of how innovation occurs in retailing. According to his ''wheel of retailing'' theory, new forms of retailing start out as discounters, selling merchandise at low cost. As the discounters compete with one another, they increase their assortments of merchandise and their services, and as a result the profit they take on each item increases to cover those costs. Increasing prices has the effect of creating an opening for new discounters to undersell the first discounters, thereby continuing the cycle. Mr. McNair, who was born in West Sparta, N.Y., and graduated from Harvard College in 1916, joined the Harvard Business School faculty in 1920 after earning his master's degree in English. It was a time in the business school's history, 12 years after its founding in 1908, when a new dean, Wallace B. Donham, and Melvin Copeland, an influential professor who directed the school's Bureau of Business Research, were developing the school's method of studying businesses on a case-by-case basis. In 1919, while still a graduate student at Harvard, Mr. McNair began correcting Professor Copeland's students' marketing reports for grammar and later began grading the papers. At Professor Copeland's urging, Mr. McNair, who had developed an interest in retailing, abandoned his Shakespearean studies to become an instructor in retailing. He also assisted Dr. Copeland and Dean Donham in developing the case method. With his background in literature, he brought to the case method ''clarity of thinking and brevity of expression,'' according to Jeffrey L. Cruikshank, who is writing a commissioned history of the Harvard Business School. Retirement in 1963 Mr. McNair once said that he sought to infuse a case with drama and suspense so that it became ''a really living thing'' for the students. As a professor in the marketing department, Mr. McNair developed his specialty in retailing. He also taught policy and business economics and for several years headed the marketing department. He was named the first Lincoln Filene Professor of Retailing in 1950, a post he held until 1961. He retired from teaching at Harvard in 1963. For 25 years, from 1920 on, he also compiled annual predictions of the nation's retail market, called ''Operating Results of Department and Specialty Stores,'' and gave the annual address to the National Retail Dry Goods Association. After his retirement, he moved permanently to a summer home he had maintained in Madison, N.H., and continued to write on retailing. He also gave guest lectures at several business schools and continued to pursue his hobbies as an outdoorsman, hunting and fishing in New England. Mr. McNair's wife, the former Mary Hemenway, died in 1969. He is survived by two sons, Malcolm Perrine McNair Jr. of Bronxville, N.Y., and Robert Edwin McNair of Swarthmore, Pa.; seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Services will be held at 3 P.M. Thursday at the Madison Church with burial following in the family plot in Madison Cemetery."

George Harrar, a retired president of the Rockefeller Foundation and a biologist who led the foundation's agricultural research that helped produce the so-called Green Revolution, died Sunday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y.","Dr. J. George Harrar, a retired president of the Rockefeller Foundation and a biologist who led the foundation's agricultural research that helped produce the so-called Green Revolution, died Sunday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 75 years old. While Dr. Harrar was its president -from 1961 until he reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 in 1971 - the foundation's assets doubled, to $1 billion. It was a time when the foundation expanded its activity both in this country and abroad, and increasingly devoted funds to programs promoting equal opportunities for minority groups and, later, to environmental protection. It was also a time when foundations, in general, came under attack from Congressional critics who wanted tighter regulation of the taxexempt instititions, and Dr. Harrar became one of the most outspoken defenders of the private philanthropies. In the foundation community, he was esteemed as a plain-speaking scientist who believed that peace and Western civilization depended on feeding and educating the world's poor. ''An untrained man is the human counterpart of an unproductive acre,'' he once said. Received 30 Honorary Degrees He received 30 honorary degrees from American institutions and a number of decorations from foreign countries that benefited from his research. Dr. Harrar did his first work for the foundation in the 1940's, when he was selected to head a research project designed to increase the productivity of food crops in Mexico. He was then a plant pathologist at Washington State College, but he had earlier taught at the University of Puerto Rico and was fluent in Spanish. Increased Crop Yields For months, he worked virtually alone, traveling the rugged terrain and collecting more than 1,500 varieties of corn. The experiments to improve corn and wheat strains dramatically increased crop yields. The new wheat varieties increased crop output sevenfold, and the Mexican research became a model for agricultural programs in other countries. Spectacular gains were made also in rice yields developed by the Rockefeller Foundation and used in Asia. Dr. Harrar, who was born in Painsville, Ohio, came to New York in 1952 as deputy director of the Rockefeller Foundation's Division of Natural Sciences and Agriculture. He became a vice president in 1959 and, two years later, became president, succeeding Dean Rusk, who had resigned to become Secretary of State. Dr. Harrar also had a key role in the establishment of a chain of international research centers that has grown into a global network of 14 institutes. These operations last year received $120 million from governments, foundations and international agencies devoted to development of third world countries. The formulation of this collaborative effort was said to have been a series of conversations between Dr. Harrar and Forrest Frank Hill, a fellow agricultural scientist at the Ford Foundation. The idea reportedly took shape as the two commuted together from Scarsdale. Dr. Harrar is survived by his wife, the former Georgetta Steese; two daughters, Mrs. Alvin Wilson of Pomona, N.Y., and Mrs. David Denhardt of London, Canada, and a sister, Mrs. John Filmer of Canfield, Ohio. A memorial service will be held Saturday at 3 P.M. at the Scarsdale Congregational Church."
18300,"Nguyen Cao Ky, South Vietnam Leader, Dies at 80","Nguyen Cao Ky, the flamboyant former South Vietnamese Air Force commander who served for two years as his country's wartime leader, then fled to the United States when Saigon fell to the Communists, died Saturday at the age of 80.","Nguyen Cao Ky, the flamboyant former South Vietnamese Air Force commander who served for two years as his country's wartime leader, then fled to the United States when Saigon fell to the Communists, died Saturday at the age of 80. Mr. Ky died at a hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he was being treated for a respiratory infection, a nephew, Peter Phan, told The Associated Press. After serving in both the Communist and French colonial armies, he rose through the ranks of South Vietnam's fledgling air force, then led Vietnam as prime minister from 1965 to 1967 before serving as vice president under his bitter rival, Nguyen Van Thieu. As Communist troops closed in on Saigon, the city now called Ho Chi Minh City, in April 1975, Mr. Ky piloted a helicopter to one of the American naval ships that were refuge to those high-ranking officers who managed to flee. He settled in Southern California, where he tried his hand at business with little success, declaring bankruptcy after running a liquor store from 1977 to 1984, then failing in a shrimp fishing venture in Louisiana. He re-emerged in the news in 2004 when he became the highest-ranking former South Vietnamese official to return to Vietnam, at the invitation of the Communist government. In government, he relished a bad-boy reputation, striking a vivid figure in his purple scarf, thin mustache and cigarette and appearing on occasion with his glamorous wife, both wearing matching black flight suits. ''American diplomats, generals and journalists nattered about my preference for purple socks, noted that I wore my hair longer than a U.S. Marine Corps drill instructor or reported, erroneously but often, that I packed a pearl-handled' revolver,'' Mr. Ky wrote in his 2002 memoir, ''Buddha's Child: My Fight to Save Vietnam.'' With evident delight, he quoted a description of him by the Vietnam War historian Stanley Karnow as ''looking like a saxophone player in a second-rate nightclub.'' Born in 1930 near Hanoi and raised by an aunt, Nguyen Cao Ky joined the Communist resistance to French colonial rule at the age of 16, inspired by Ho Chi Minh. He fell ill with malaria, and when he recovered he was drafted by the French-controlled government, which sent him abroad to train as a pilot, though he never saw combat. When the country was divided in 1954 after the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, he fled south along with hundreds of thousands of others and joined the American-backed South Vietnamese Air Force. In 1965, when he was 34 and a commander of the air force, he was chosen by his fellow military officers to lead the country as prime minister, ending a cycle of coups and countercoups that followed the 1963 assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. In his book, Mr. Ky quotes an assessment of him by the State Department official William Bundy that he was ''the bottom of the barrel'' and the last choice for the job. In power, he made a show of cracking down on corruption, executing one businessman accused of war profiteering, and he threatened to kill dissidents, opponents and bomb units led by rival officers, and he suppressed a Buddhist-led uprising in 1966. After fleeing to the United States, Mr. Ky fended off accusations of corruption himself. Responding in 1984 to the columnist Jack Anderson, who accused Mr. Ky of being involved with criminal gangs, he said: ''If I had stolen millions of dollars I could live like a king in this country, but obviously I don't live like a king.'' In his book he made light of his struggles to make a new life in America. ''When a former national leader becomes a storekeeper, it is news,'' he wrote. ''Journalists of every sort visited my store. One day a bus driver came in to ask if his passengers, German tourists, could enter and see me. I discovered that my business was a standard stop on his tour, which ended at Disneyland.'' In 1990, he was still advocating the overthrow of the Communist government in Vietnam, but speaking in more moderate tones. ''I think Americans and Vietnamese can achieve today what we could not achieve during the Vietnam war: a final victory over the Communists,'' he told The New York Times. His position mellowed further as the years passed. By the time of his visit to Vietnam 14 years later, he had turned against Vietnamese hard-liners. ''I think it's very wrong that some -- especially some Vietnamese overseas in America -- today are asking and demanding that Vietnam has to adopt some sort of democracy like they have in America,'' he said. ''It's not fit for Vietnam in the present situation.'' His return to Vietnam was both politically symbolic and personally sentimental. ''Last night, I thought, 30 years ago I cried because I left my homeland,'' he told a news conference in Ho Chi Minh City, a place he had last seen from his helicopter as he fled in defeat. ''And today I cried once again because I found my homeland.''"

He was 60. Michael Cuscuna, his partner at Mosaic, said Mr. Lourie had been suffering from scleroderma, a rare viral disease, for the last three years. Mosaic, started 17 years ago by Mr. Lourie and Mr. Cuscuna, is the most distinctive reissue label in jazz -- a successful operation by and for hard-core enthusiasts. Sold only by mail order, its CD and vinyl-record box-sets are uniform, monolithic, and serious. They have ranged in size from a 2-CD Don Cherry set to an 18-CD Nat (King) Cole set. Printed in limited-edition quantities, mostly of 500 copies, and decorated with black-and-white images only, the Mosaic reissues tend to collect all the existing recordings of an artist on a particular label, or within a particular time frame; they come with 10,000-word essays by jazz critics and historians. Many of the photographs draw from the archives of Francis Wolff, who covered jazz sessions from the 1940's to the 70's, and the images are printed from original negatives on glossy paper. The partners' 105 projects have included major reissues of Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, Herbie Nichols, Count Basie and Andrew Hill, among others. The company, which began with no outside financing, is now half owned by EMI. Its Nat Cole set, from 1990, with a list price of $270, sold 6,000 copies. Mr. Lourie came to a career in the jazz-record industry through an early life as a clarinetist, both jazz and classical. He was born in Boston and attended the New England Conservatory. In the 1960's he worked throughout the Boston area with chamber groups, symphony orchestras, and jazz ensembles. In 1968 Mr. Lourie moved to New York, filling the position of manager of contemporary artist relations at Columbia Records. By the early 70's he was in charge of the merchandising department at Columbia's sub-label, Epic. In 1974 he moved to Los Angeles and became head of marketing at Blue Note records, and in the late 70's he was hired by Warner Bros., where he was made director of jazz and progressive music. He founded Mosaic records in 1983 with Mr. Cuscuna, operating out of Santa Monica, Calif., and moving to Stamford in 1985.

Nitze, an expert on military power and strategic arms whose roles as negotiator, diplomat and Washington insider spanned the era from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan and helped shape America's cold war relationship with the Soviet Union, died Tuesday night at his home in Washington.","Paul H. Nitze, an expert on military power and strategic arms whose roles as negotiator, diplomat and Washington insider spanned the era from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan and helped shape America's cold war relationship with the Soviet Union, died Tuesday night at his home in Washington. He was 97. The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Elisabeth Scott Porter. From the beginning of the nuclear age, whether in government or out, Mr. Nitze urged successive American presidents to take measures against what he saw as the Soviet drive to overwhelm the United States through the force of arms. Yet he may be best remembered for his conciliatory role in efforts to achieve two major arms agreements with the Soviet Union. In one, he was successful in negotiating an agreement that eliminated intermediate-range missiles from Europe. In the other, he hoped to cap his long career with a so-called grand compromise in 1988 that would have severely circumscribed work on President Reagan's cherished strategic missile defense initiative in exchange for deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of both superpowers. His efforts foundered when the negotiators ran out of time as the Reagan administration came to an end. In a now legendary moment of the cold war, Mr. Nitze undertook a bold but unsuccessful personal effort to achieve an earlier arms agreement with the Russians. In 1982, acting on his own and, some say, superseding his instructions, Mr. Nitze took a walk with his Soviet counterpart in the Jura Mountains, where he tried to strike a bargain on a package dealing with intermediate-range missiles in Europe. In that episode -- which later became the subject of the Broadway play ''A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing -- Mr. Nitze tried to cut through the bureaucratic tangle but was thwarted when both Moscow and Washington repudiated the agreement. Mr. Nitze (pronounced NITS-uh) refused an appointment in the first Bush administration as ambassador at large emeritus, saying it would leave him with no clear responsibilities. He retired to an office at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University -- a school that was named for him in 1989 -- where he continued to write articles in a continuing attempt to influence policy. With that, his long career in government came to an end, a career that began in 1940 with a telegram that said, ''Be in Washington Monday, Forrestal.'' The summons from James V. Forrestal, then a special assistant at the White House, lured Mr. Nitze from the lucrative confines of Wall Street to the first of many assignments in government that involved him in the supply of the Allies for the war effort, a survey of the impact of the Allied bombing of Germany and Japan, the feeding of the hungry of war-ravaged Europe, the creation of the Marshall Plan and crises in Iran and Berlin. In the aftermath of World War II, Mr. Nitze became part of the remarkable group of public servants -- George F. Kennan, Charles E. Bohlen, Robert A. Lovett, John J. McCloy -- that coalesced around Dean Acheson to develop foreign political and military policy as the United States took its place as a major world power. He was a senior State Department official in the Truman administration, an assistant defense secretary in the Kennedy administration, and Navy secretary and later deputy defense secretary in the Johnson administration. By the time he became one of the chief negotiators on strategic weapons, Mr. Nitze had accumulated more experience in national security affairs than anyone else of his time, to the point that his critics began to think that he believed he had a monopoly on understanding the political uses of nuclear weapons. Postwar Policy Framework Ever since 1950, when as head of the policy planning staff of the State Department he was the principal author of a study on the Soviet threat, Mr. Nitze took a dark view of Soviet intentions, seeing in the Kremlin a drive for world hegemony. The study, known as N.S.C.-68, conceived of deterrence in military rather than diplomatic terms, warned against sole reliance on the nuclear deterrent and urged a buildup of conventional forces. Its precepts became a cornerstone of American policy. In succeeding years, when the United States nuclear monopoly was broken, Mr. Nitze warned regularly that the Soviet Union was trying to achieve preponderant nuclear strength as a tool of blackmail or, in the worst case, to win an all-out war. Later, when Mr. Nitze took his walk in the woods near Geneva to work out an arms deal, he confounded his critics, who considered him too hard-line because of his pessimistic views of the Russians. A man of intimidating intellect, Mr. Nitze could be warm and affectionate or cerebral and brittle. He was a formidable bureaucrat with a brilliant mind and a persuasive pen. Out of government-- as he was during the Carter administration-- he was an equally effective critic, as he showed in the late 1970's as the mastermind of the opposition to the second strategic arms limitation agreement. He used complicated charts and computer printouts to warn that the treaty would lock the United States into permanent strategic inferiority. Despite that vigorous opposition, once Mr. Nitze was back in government he urged President Reagan to comply with the terms of the treaty, even though it was never ratified, and to try to reach a better agreement with Moscow. Among his colleagues there were those who said Mr. Nitze was so embittered at being excluded from the Carter administration that he could not assess the treaty dispassionately. He had too often been passed over for the major jobs, always on tap but never on top, as his old neighbor James Reston once wrote. He always seemed too conservative for the liberal administrations and too liberal for the conservative ones. In an interview in which he looked back at his long career in government, Mr. Nitze acknowledged that it was one of his life's major disappointments that he had never been appointed to a cabinet-level position -- as secretary of state or defense, or as director of central intelligence. ''I sometimes think I would have liked to be secretary of agriculture,'' he said with a rueful chuckle. While his considerable expertise was in political-military affairs, his little joke was not far off the mark, and in his later years he tried to get the country to deal with environmental problems. For years, in addition to homes in Washington, Northeast Harbor, Me., and Aspen, Colo., he maintained a 1,920-acre working farm in Maryland on the banks of the Potomac, where he kept pigs and cattle and grew corn. It was there that he rode horses, sailed along the Potomac and practiced the piano in a lifelong endeavor to understand, as one friend said, why Bach sounds like Bach. A Confirmed Pessimist For all that good life, Mr. Nitze -- handsome with a full head of white hair and still athletic and trim in his later years, well-educated, intelligent and wealthy -- remained a confirmed pessimist, having been deeply affected by seeing at first hand the outbreak of the two world wars. Paul Henry Nitze was born on Jan. 16, 1907, in Amherst, Mass., where his father, one of the world's leading philologists, was a professor of Romance languages. The Nitze family did not live on a professor's salary, though. Mr. Nitze explained that ''both my grandparents did very well.'' During his childhood there were summers in Europe, mainly in Germany, and the family was in the Tyrol in 1914 when World War I broke out. Mr. Nitze spent much of his boyhood in Chicago. His father taught at the university, and he attended experimental schools before going on to Hotchkiss and Harvard. Generally a good student, he said: ''I distinguished myself by getting the lowest mark ever given at Harvard, a zero, in a course on the history of economic thought. The most beautiful girl suggested that I go down to Newport for the weekend on the day of the final exam.'' The zero left no permanent economic scar, for Nitze got rich in Wall Street despite the Depression, first at Dillon Read & Company and then in his own firm. He made one fortune from a company he started with other investors, known as the U.S. Vitamin and Pharmaceutical Company. Another fortune came from real estate investments in Aspen. In 1932 he married Phyllis Pratt, whose grandfather was a founder of the Standard Oil Company of New York and the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Mrs. Nitze died in June 1987. In 1993 he married Elisabeth Porter. She survives him, as do his four children: Heidi Nitze and Peter, both of New York; William, of Washington, and Phyllis Anina Nitze Moriarty of Boston; a stepdaughter, Erin Porter, of Salt Spring Island, British Columbia; 11 grandchildren; three step-grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. There will be a memorial service at 11 a.m. Saturday in the National Cathedral in Washington, followed by a reception at the Metropolitan Club, 1700 H Street NW, Washington. Burial will be private. Earlier this year, in one of his last public appearances, Mr. Nitze was present in Maine at the christening of a Navy guided-missile destroyer bearing his name, only the eighth time the Navy has named a warship for a living person. Mr. Nitze was called to Washington by Mr. Forrestal -- then an assistant to President Roosevelt -- who had been president of Dillon Read, where Mr. Nitze had been a vice president. It was 1940 and Mr. Nitze, who had seen Hitler during a visit to Germany, opposed United States entry into the war. But he quickly became active in the American war effort. He helped draft the Selective Service Act and, in 1942, became chief of the Metals and Minerals Branch of the Board of Economic Warfare. Subsequently he became director of foreign procurement and development for the Foreign Economic Administration. He was vice chairman of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, a study that years later caused him to question United States bombing strategy in Vietnam. After the war he headed the billion-dollar global relief program. In 1950, during the Truman administration, he succeeded George F. Kennan as head of the State Department's policy planning staff. It was then that Mr. Nitze started making his mark as a political-military strategist whose dark view of the Russians surpassed those of Mr. Kennan and Mr. Bohlen, the nation's leading experts on the Soviet Union. Mr. Kennan found the language of N.S.C.-68 to be dangerously melodramatic and unhelpful. Seven years later, although he was out of favor during the Eisenhower administration, Mr. Nitze was appointed to the presidential committee headed by H. Rowan Gaither that called for nationwide fallout shelters and warned of a ''missile gap'' that eventually proved to be illusory. Mr. Nitze was a Democrat who changed parties to protest Roosevelt's effort to pack the Supreme Court. He returned to the fold at the beginning of the Eisenhower administration. Squeezed out of office because of his association with Mr. Acheson and discouraged at being on the outside, Mr. Nitze went back to his farm and, at the suggestion of his wife, who wanted to take his mind off his troubles, entered a horse race at the Charles County fair. When he won, he acknowledged, at least to himself, his longing for recognition. President Kennedy offered Mr. Nitze several jobs and gave him 30 seconds to decide which one he wanted. He chose deputy defense secretary, but did not get the post until seven years later. In the intervening years he was an assistant secretary in the Pentagon and then secretary of the Navy. When President Nixon appointed Mr. Nitze to the United States delegation to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviet Union, he played an important role in negotiating the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, but he resigned in 1974, charging that the ''depressing reality of the traumatic events'' related to Watergate was making the administration too eager to cut a deal with the Russians. As an early supporter of Jimmy Carter, Mr. Nitze expected that he would finally get a major appointment and was bitterly disappointed when he was passed over once again. His views were too hawkish for the liberal foreign policy that President Carter wanted to pursue. Mr. Nitze mounted a spirited -- some called it venomous -- opposition to the confirmation of one of his old colleagues, Paul C. Warnke, as Mr. Carter's strategic arms negotiator, incurring the wrath of old friends who labeled him an ideologue. Critic of Carter Arms Pact When Mr. Warnke was confirmed and the Carter administration achieved a second strategic arms limitation treaty, Mr. Nitze became its most vocal and effective critic, the intellectual guru for the Committee on the Present Danger in its campaign against the agreement. It was never ratified. Mr. Nitze's hard line toward Moscow found greater resonance with the next president, Ronald Reagan, who put him in charge of the United States delegation to the talks on intermediate-range nuclear weapons. His mandate was to negotiate the so-called zero-zero option by which the United States would forgo future American deployment of new missiles in Europe if the Soviet Union would remove the missiles it had targeted on Western Europe. The two sides were far apart when Mr. Nitze went on the now famous walk in the woods to draw the Russians into a package deal. When the proposal was rejected by both sides, Mr. Nitze, instead of being reprimanded, was appointed special adviser to the president on arms control matters in 1984. Though the Soviet Union rejected the zero-zero option, a few years later it accepted a more comprehensive arrangement, the so-called double zero agreement that limited medium-range missiles in Europe and shorter-range missiles as well. That agreement was signed on Dec. 8, 1987. In November 1985, Mr. Reagan awarded Mr. Nitze the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Yet that same year Mr. Nitze once again seemed to be going out on his own to raise serious questions about Mr. Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. While insisting that he favored the program, informally known as Star Wars, he laid down such stringent terms for its acceptability that he seemed to be torpedoing it from the start, in effect handing useful arguments to its opponents. At the same time, he was seeking to make a deal that would limit the elaborate new antimissile system in exchange for cuts in offensive weapons, a two-pronged ploy that once again provided evidence of his cunning and skill as a negotiator, another example of a talent that contributed to a lifetime of survival in Washington. ''Some people say there are two policies in the executive branch,'' he said one day as he sat in his office on the seventh floor of the State Department just before his 79th birthday. ''One is mine and the other is the president's, which is marginally so. Some of the things I've said are different from what the president has said, but all the things I have said have been approved by the president.''"

21481,"Brigid Brophy Is Dead at 66; Novelist, Critic and Crusader","Brigid Brophy, a novelist, critic, essayist and crusader for myriad causes ranging from better royalty payments for writers to better treatment for animals, died on Monday at a nursing home in Lincolnshire, England.","LONDON, Aug. 8 Brigid Brophy, a novelist, critic, essayist and crusader for myriad causes ranging from better royalty payments for writers to better treatment for animals, died on Monday at a nursing home in Lincolnshire, England. She was 66 and had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for many years. Miss Brophy was the author of 4 plays, 7 novels and 14 other books, but she is just as well known for her most successful campaign, for lending rights for authors. In 1979, her efforts resulted in a law that for the first time allowed authors to receive royalty payments from the British Government every time their books were checked out of a public library. But Miss Brophy also campaigned -- even from her sickbed -- for the rights of women, of prisoners and of animals. She was a vice president of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, and no animal escaped her sympathy. She even became active in an anti-angling campaign, and at one point sent a letter to the fishing correspondent of The Daily Telegraph in which she compared anglers to ""thugs who beat up old-age pensioners for fun"" and quoted Lord Byron's remark that fishing was ""the stupidest of pretended sports."" Brigid Antonia Brophy was born in 1929 in London, the only daughter of the Anglo-Irish novelist John Brophy. She was educated at St. Paul's Girls' School and later at Oxford, where she excelled as a scholar but was soon expelled because of drunken, raucous behavior. She was acting, she later wrote, ""in the belief that I had more to learn by pursuing my personal life than from textual emendation, with the result that the authorities could put up with me for only just over a year. ""I came down at the age of 19 without a degree and with a consequent sense of nudity which I have never quite overcome."" In 1954, before she was even 30, she burst onto the literary scene when her novel ""Hackenfeller's Ape,"" about an ape at the London Zoo and its increasingly close relationship to the professor observing its mating habits, won the Cheltenham Literary Festival First Prize for a first novel. Her novels are known for their imagination and acerbic wit, and include ""The Snow Ball,"" in which the characters attend a ball dressed as figures from ""Don Giovanni""; ""Flesh,"" which she described as ""an almost distressingly cold-blooded little story,"" and ""In Transit,"" set, claustrophobically, in an airport transit lounge. But she also developed a reputation as a sharp thinker and fierce intellectual who liked a good fight, and her nonfiction books tended to have provocative, often mischievous points of view. In 1967, for instance, she was one of the authors of ""Fifty Works of English Literature We Could Do Without,"" an attack on a number of classic books including ""Jane Eyre,"" which was likened by the authors to ""gobbling a jar-full of school-girl stick-jaw."" She also championed the writing of Ronald Firbank in ""Prancing Novelist"" (1973), subtitled ""A Defense of Fiction in the Form of a Critical Biography in Praise of Ronald Firbank."" Miss Brophy, who spoke freely in her early years about her bisexuality and often referred to marriage as ""an immoral institution,"" nonetheless married in 1954. Her husband, the art historian Michael Levey, shared her delight in literature and the arts. He became director of the National Gallery in 1973 and was knighted eight years later. In a tribute to Miss Brophy in The Independent on Tuesday, her literary agent, Giles Gordon, described her as a ""deeply shy, courteous woman"" who wrote delightful thank-you letters and kept to rigorous standards in her work. ""Woe betide the 'editor' who tried to rewrite her fastidious, logical, exact prose, change a colon to a semi-colon (or vice-versa), or try to spell 'show' other than 'shew,' slavish Shavian that Brophy was,"" Mr. Gordon wrote. In 1979, Miss Brophy's physical problem was diagnosed as multiple sclerosis, which steadily worsened until she was housebound and had to use a wheelchair. She remained at home, looked after by paid companions, friends and her husband, who in 1987 quit his job to help care for her. But she continued to work with all the energy her illness would allow. In 1987 she published ""Baroque 'n' Roll,"" a collection of essays in which she outlined, with lucidity and detail, the debilitating toll her condition had taken on her. Eventually, her condition deteriorated so badly that she had to move into the nursing home where she died. She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Kate."

He was 79 years old. Mr. Pan's daughter, Michelene Laski, who announced his death, said that Mr. Astaire had once told her, ''he was the only person I ever saw who could dance like I did.'' Mr. Pan choreographed about 50 films, but it was the classic, 1930's musicals starring Mr. Astaire and Ginger Rogers, with ebullient scores by Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, George Gershwin and Vincent Youmans, that highlight the choreographer's legacy. The nine films, produced at RKO-Radio Pictures from 1933 to 1939, were ''Flying Down to Rio,'' ''The Gay Divorcee,'' ''Roberta,'' ''Top Hat,'' ''Follow the Fleet,'' ''Swing Time,'' ''Shall We Dance,'' ''Carefree'' and ''The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle.'' Complicated Rehearsals In 1988, Mr. Pan recounted his collaboration with Mr. Astaire. While the choreographer was shaping the ensemble numbers, he said, Mr. Astaire started working out his dances with Miss Rogers. Then, the two men would refine them together, and then Mr. Pan would introduce them to Miss Rogers and, finally, ''Fred and Ginger would rehearse and perform them.'' Laughing, he recalled, ''With Fred I was Ginger, and with Ginger I was Fred.'' Hal Borne, Mr. Astaire's longtime arranger and rehearsal pianist, offered said of the choreographer in 1972: ''Hermes was terribly instrumental in everything that Fred did. He was really Fred's alter ego. His ideas for choreography were exactly what Fred wanted.'' Mr. Pan, a self-effacing man who met Mr. Astaire in 1933 during rehearsals for ''Flying Down to Rio,'' said in 1985: ''It was a fortunate situation that I met Astaire and that he was of the same outlook, feeling and mentality as I was. It sort of blended into a beautiful thing.'' The choreographer earned his Oscar in 1937 for ''Damsel in Distress,'' starring Mr. Astaire and Joan Fontaine. He was cited particularly for ''Fun House,'' a hilarious battle between Mr. Astaire and treadmills, revolving barrels, slides and distorted mirrors. An Emmy in 1961 In his later films, Mr. Pan danced occasionally with such partners as Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. Among these movies were ''Moon Over Miami,'' ''My Gal Sal,'' ''The Barkleys of Broadway,'' ''Kiss Me Kate,'' ''Hit the Deck,'' ''Silk Stockings,'' ''Pal Joey,'' ''Porgy and Bess'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' His later awards included an Emmy in 1961 for ''Astaire Time: An Evening With Fred Astaire'' and a Joffrey Ballet citation in 1986. Mr. Pan, whose original name was Hermes Panagiotopolous, was born in Memphis and raised in Nashville. He began his career in Broadway choruses and went to Hollywood as half of a dance team with his sister, now Vasso Meade. Besides his daughter and sister, he is survived by several grandchildren."

He was 73. Mr. Hank Gonzalez, famous for coining the phrase ""A politician who is poor is a poor politician,"" died of prostate cancer at his ranch in the central Mexican city of Santiago Tianguistenco, his family announced. Mr. Hank Gonzalez was a behind-the-scenes force in the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The party governed Mexico from 1929 until last year, when President Vicente Fox became the first opposition candidate to win the presidency. Mr. Hank Gonzalez was Mexico City's mayor, governor of Mexico state, agriculture secretary and director of the tourism ministry. He exemplified the party's old-guard leaders, who built careers by doing small favors for supporters in rural areas. A successful businessman whose holdings included a large share of Mercedes-Benz of Mexico, he used his fame as a politician to enhance his private ventures. He amassed a fortune that made his family one of the richest in Mexico. ""He personified Mexico's political businessman,"" said Homero Aridijis, a political analyst. ""He was the most powerful fixture in Mexican politics for 30 years because his influence extended beyond the length of any one presidential term."" Mr. Hank Gonzalez, from a German immigrant family, first won public office in Atacomulco, a municipality in Mexico State. There he became a rising star in a local government that served as a showcase for classic governing party politics and rewarded local support by lavishing the area with largely unnecessary public works projects. He later founded the Atacomulco political movement, a group committed to furthering party goals. Mr. Hank Gonzalez had been battling cancer since 1986, and he had been sick and fallen out of public view in recent years. His son, Carlos Hank Rhon, has continued to make headlines, however. Mr. Hank Rhon ran afoul of the United States' Federal Reserve Board regarding his ownership of Laredo National Bancshares, an offshore holding company that the Fed alleged he used to sell surreptitiously part ownership in the Laredo National Bank to his father and other business associates. Mr. Hank Rhon denied those charges, but in May agreed to pay the American government $40 million and resign as chairman of the bank's board of directors. Mr. Hank Gonzalez is also survived by his wife, Maria Guadalupe Rhon Garcia, and three other children: Jorge, Ivone and Marisela Hank Rohn. Article 82 of the Mexican Constitution, which once barred first-generation Mexicans from running for president, kept Mr. Hank Gonzalez from emerging as his party's presidential candidate. The measure was amended in the 1990's to allow a candidate who has at least one native-born parent and who has lived in Mexico for at least 20 years to run, but by then Mr. Hank Gonzalez's political career was winding down. Mexico's current president, Vicente Fox, whose mother was born in Spain, became the main beneficiary of the constitutional change."

She was 95. Dr. Zeller, who at 83 survived an accident in which she was struck by a bus and critically injured, died in her sleep, said her niece, Laura Glass. From 1944 until 1972, Dr. Zeller was the chairwoman of the Legislative Conference of the City Colleges, a lobbying group that later became the first union to represent the permanent faculty in the City University system. In 1972, the conference merged with the United Federation of College Teachers, a rival union representing part-time instructors. For the next four years, Dr. Zeller was president of the joint group, the Professional Staff Congress. As a labor advocate for the professors, Dr. Zeller lobbied for legislation to establish tenure and pensions that today are considered some of the basic rights of public college teachers in New York State. She used her academic expertise in the legislative process to champion the rights of faculty members, becoming a familiar figure at City Hall and the State Capitol. ""When it came to representing the faculty, she was irrepressible,"" said Irwin H. Polishook, who has been president of Professional Staff Congress since Dr. Zeller retired in 1976. ""She would burst in on legislators who were busy with other business, even if they were behind closed doors, even if they were in conference. Because of who she was, people accepted that. She was able to get people's attention because she was a scholar as well as an activist."" Belle Zeller was born in New York City on April 8, 1903. She was one of nine children of a couple who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to New York, where her father worked in a shoe factory. Her parents and older siblings often discussed politics around the dinner table and she became fascinated by government at an early age. She attended Hunter College High School and Hunter College, where she specialized in history and the social sciences, earning a B.A. in 1924 and an M.A. in 1926. She was one of the system's few female professors when she began teaching at Hunter College's Brooklyn campus in 1927. She remained there when it changed its name to Brooklyn College in 1930, becoming one of the institution's founding instructors. In 1937, she received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University. Her doctoral dissertation, ""Pressure Politics in New York"" (Prentice Hall, 1937) was one of the first major studies of lobbying in New York State politics and it was reprinted in 1967. She was later recognized nationwide as an authority on lobbying and served as an adviser to Senator John F. Kennedy and other legislators who were revising the Federal Lobbying Registration Act. Throughout her long career, Dr. Zeller was the recipient of numerous academic awards, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the Graduate School of City University in 1985 and the President's Medal from Brooklyn College on the institution's 50th anniversary in 1980.

58007,"Jack Kraft, 93, Villanova Basketball Coach","Jack Kraft, who brought Villanova University to national basketball prominence in his 12 seasons as the Wildcats' head coach and took them to the 1971 N.C.A.A.","Jack Kraft, who brought Villanova University to national basketball prominence in his 12 seasons as the Wildcats' head coach and took them to the 1971 N.C.A.A. tournament championship game, died on Thursday at an assisted living facility in Cape May Court House, N.J. He was 93. His death was announced by Villanova. Coaching at Villanova from 1961 to 1973, Kraft had only one losing team -- his last one. His Wildcats appeared in the N.C.A.A. tournament six times and reached the National Invitation Tournament five times at a time when it carried more prestige than it does today. He also had a winning record at the University of Rhode Island. Kraft's 1970-71 Villanova team went on an unexpected run in the N.C.A.A. tournament, led by the all-American forward Howard Porter, before being beaten by U.C.L.A., 68-62, in the final, when the Bruins won a fifth consecutive championship. Villanova had made only four N.C.A.A. tournament appearances before Kraft's coaching tenure. But Villanova's achievement in 1971 was tarnished when it was revealed soon after the tournament that Porter, voted the event's most outstanding player, had signed a contract during the regular season to go on and play for the Pittsburgh Condors of the American Basketball Association. The N.C.A.A. vacated Villanova's victories in the tournament, denoting that action with an asterisk in the record books, and the university returned its proceeds from the postseason. John Jack Kraft was born on Feb. 10, 1921, in Philadelphia and played basketball for St. Joseph's of Philadelphia in the early 1940s. He coached high school basketball before being hired as Villanova's head coach. Kraft took the Wildcats to a 21-7 record and an N.C.A.A. tournament berth in his first season as coach. In addition to Porter, he coached the future N.B.A. players Chris Ford, also a member of the 1970-71 team; Wali Jones, Hubie White, Bill Melchionni and Jim Washington at Villanova and Sly Williams at Rhode Island. He had a 238-95 record at Villanova for a .715 winning percentage, the highest of any Villanova basketball coach, and his teams won at least 20 games seven times. He had a 103-88 record in seven-plus seasons at Rhode Island. Kraft, who had lived in Stone Harbor, N.J., is survived by his daughters Janice Callaghan, Cheryl Rule and June Hilton; a brother, Joseph; four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Kraft's 1971 N.C.A.A. tournament team defeated St. Joseph's, Fordham and Penn, then topped Western Kentucky, 92-89, in double overtime at the Astrodome in Houston before falling to a John Wooden-coached U.C.L.A. team with Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe, Henry Bibby and Steve Patterson. Howard Porter spent seven seasons in the N.B.A., playing for the Chicago Bulls, the Knicks, the Detroit Pistons and the New Jersey Nets. He never played in the A.B.A. But Porter became addicted to drugs. He underwent rehabilitation, then was hired as a probation officer in Minnesota in 1995, and it appeared that he had turned his life around. In May 2007, he was found severely beaten in an alley in Minneapolis, and he died soon afterward at age 58. Two men and a woman pleaded guilty in connection with his death in what one defendant described as a robbery gone bad. Kraft attended Porter's funeral service at a church on Villanova's campus outside Philadelphia. ''The last time I saw him was two basketball seasons ago,'' he told The Bucks County Courier Times. ''He looked like a million dollars. We had a nice chat. I saw that he was completely in charge of everything. He had found happiness. What more could you ask? Then you heard about this.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

17495,Alicia Markova Dies at 94; Ballerina Known for Giselle,"Dame Alicia Markova, one of the greatest British ballerinas of the 20th century, co-founder of the company now known as the English National Ballet and a former director of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, died yesterday in Bath, England, the English National Ballet announced.","Dame Alicia Markova, one of the greatest British ballerinas of the 20th century, co-founder of the company now known as the English National Ballet and a former director of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, died yesterday in Bath, England, the English National Ballet announced. She was 94. Famous for her delicacy, Dame Alicia was indelibly associated with ''Giselle,'' the supreme example of 19th-century balletic Romanticism. It was as Giselle that she made her American debut with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, giving a performance that was thought to set a standard for any other dancer attempting the part. She later performed Giselle as a star of Ballet Theater (as American Ballet Theater was originally called) and as a guest artist with companies around the world. She was so closely identified with the ballet that in 1960 she titled her autobiography ''Giselle and I.'' Audiences never tired of watching Dame Alicia in ''Giselle''; she, in turn, never seemed to tire of dancing it. Reviewing a 1958 performance by Ballet Theater in which Miss Markova appeared as guest artist, John Martin, then the dance critic of The New York Times, remarked: ''Markova has danced the role so many times that she could undoubtedly do it in her sleep; what is so notable is that she never does. She is as fresh, as sensitive, as creatively alert as if she had never done it before; but what a wealth of background she has accumulated for it!'' Lillian Alicia Marks was born in London on Dec. 1, 1910. A knock-kneed child, she was sent by her doctor to a London school called Miss Thorne's Dancing Academy. She astounded her teacher with her ability to do anything asked of her, and she was soon cast in dancing roles in Christmas pantomimes. Mrs. Marks took her daughter to a London school run by the ballerina Serafina Astafieva. She presented Astafieva with a card bearing the child's name as she had been billed in the pantomimes: ''Little Alicia: The Miniature Pavlova.'' Aghast at this presumption, Astafieva slammed the door in their faces. Later, however, she saw Alicia dance and accepted her as a pupil. In 1924 the teenage Alicia became the youngest member of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, the greatest ballet company of its day. She danced her first leading role in 1926, when she portrayed the nightingale in ''Le Rossignol,'' choreographed by George Balanchine to music by Stravinsky. Non-Russian dancers in the Ballets Russes were expected to change their names, and it was Diaghilev who gave the British dancer her professional name. He also gave Miss Markova a governess, who made sure that her charge went to bed early when she was not performing and saw to it that she did not overindulge in chocolates and that she attended no social occasions but chaperoned teas. After Diaghilev died in 1929, Miss Markova returned to London and became active with both of the pioneering British ballet groups of the day, the Ballet Rambert and the Vic-Wells Ballet, the last of which developed into the Royal Ballet. Because she was already an esteemed dancer, her presence lent prestige to these troupes and, because she was British, she proved that ballet was not something in which only Russians could excel. In 1934 she formed the Markova-Dolin Ballet with another British dancer, Anton Dolin, the partner with whom she was associated for much of her career. She joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, remaining with it until 1941, when she joined Ballet Theater, where Mr. Dolin was again her partner. In 1945 they formed a Markova-Dolin Ballet in America. Returning to Britain after the war, they made their troupe the basis of the London Festival Ballet (today's English National Ballet). Mr. Dolin was its first director; Miss Markova was its ballerina until 1952, after which she devoted herself to guest performances. She retired as a dancer in 1963, the year Queen Elizabeth II named her Dame of the British Empire. Known for her beautiful purity of line and her classic simplicity of movement, Dame Alicia was admired in ''Swan Lake'' and ''Les Sylphides'' as well as in ''Giselle.'' Yet this ethereal ballerina could surprise audiences with her range. She certainly did so with Ballet Theater in 1942 when she danced two contrasting roles. One was Juliet in Antony Tudor's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' In 1946 the dance historian Grace Robert praised that interpretation in ''The Borzoi Book of Ballets,'' writing that ''Markova's deerlike shyness in the first scene, her tragic, controlled despair, the exquisite movement of her hand as she wakes up in the tomb scene, all are unforgettable in their subtlety.'' But this poignant Juliet was tempestuous as the gypsy Zemphira in Leonide Massine's ''Aleko.'' ''The great surprise of 'Aleko' was the superb Zemphira of Alicia Markova,'' Robert wrote. ''Her exquisite 'Swan Lake' and matchless 'Giselle' contained no hint of the fire and quite different sort of dramatic intensity of her gypsy. With sunburnt makeup, wild hair and a vivid red costume, her very appearance was a shock, though a delightful one.'' Dame Alicia, who had occasionally made guest appearances in the ballet sequences of works in the repertory of the Metropolitan Opera, astonished the dance world in 1963 when she accepted an invitation to direct the Metropolitan Opera Ballet. The Met's dance troupe had never been considered important and the opera management had seldom shown much interest in ballet. Nevertheless, in her six years as director, Dame Alicia raised the dancers' technical level and made it possible for the ballet company to present programs of its own. In 1970 Dame Alicia became a distinguished lecturer on ballet at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, the home school of the Cincinnati Ballet. She remained there until 1974, after which she gave occasional master classes for many organizations, including the Royal Ballet School. She also staged revivals of ballets in which she had starred, and presided over dance festivals and conferences. A gala was held in honor of Dame Alicia's 80th birthday on Dec. 2, 1990, at the Sadler's Wells Theater in London. On that occasion, Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, spoke in tribute to her. A tiny black-haired woman, Dame Alicia was just over 5 feet 2 inches tall, and during her dancing years she rarely weighed more than 98 pounds, even though she usually devoured a thick steak after performances. Her life was as carefully organized as her dancing. She moved through each day with quiet determination and her life was almost entirely devoted to ballet. She never married. Among her few diversions were expensive clothes, classical music and gin rummy, at which she usually won."

The cause was leukemia, a Lehman Brothers spokeswoman said. During a career that spanned more than 30 years at Lehman, Mr. Lewis rode the financial roller coaster of the last 25 years, through the boom and bust of the junk bond market, the 1987 stock market crash and the Internet boom of the late 1990's. He was a witness to the consolidation of the financial industry that has led to the present day behemoths. Mr. Lewis began his investment banking career in 1964. In 1973, he joined the brokerage firm Loeb Rhoades & Company and by 1977 was appointed president and co-chief executive, positions he maintained after Loeb merged with rival Hornblower, Weeks, Noyes & Trask, where he headed the investment banking division. After Shearson Hayden Stone, led by Sanford I. Weill, bought Loeb Rhoades, Hornblower & Company in 1979 for $250 million -- at the time the largest merger in Wall Street history -- Mr. Lewis was named president and vice chairman of the combined firm. Mr. Lewis stayed on after Mr. Weill sold Shearson to American Express in 1981 for $930 million. After Shearson bought the investment bank Lehman Brothers for $360 million in 1984, he rose to become co-head of investment banking and vice chairman. Lehman went on a buying spree during the 1980's. It expanded in Europe, Asia and the United States, entered new businesses and invested substantially in junk bonds. Then, the market crash in 1987 took its toll and American Express spun it off to its shareholders in 1994. Today, Lehman is one of only a few independent investment banks left. When it was formed in 1978, Loeb Rhoades, Hornblower & Company was considered a giant -- with annual revenue of $450 million. Last year, Lehman Brothers' revenue reached $8.6 billion.

Robbins, who developed several widely used statistical techniques and wrote a popular book that inspired many students to enter the mathematics profession, died Monday at Princeton Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. He was 86. The cause was esophageal cancer, his family said. Among the general public, Dr. Robbins is best known for the book ""What Is Mathematics?"" which he wrote with the mathematician Richard Courant. Published in 1941, the book was praised by Albert Einstein. It surveyed a wide range of advanced mathematics in a manner understandable to nonmathematicians. In the field of statistics, Dr. Robbins developed techniques for improving predictions by drawing on additional related data. One example is predicting the number of accidents by drivers who have not been involved in an accident in the past year. ""You don't want to predict they're going to have no accidents next year,"" said Dr. Bruce Levin, a professor of biostatistics at Columbia University, where Dr. Robbins was a professor of mathematical statistics for many years. ""Clearly that's too low."" Dr. Robbins showed that with certain assumptions, a good prediction would be the number of drivers involved in exactly one accident in the past year. The techniques, known as empirical Bayes methods, have now found wide use, including analyzing data from the census and from clinical trials in which a completely random sample is not possible. ""He really developed it out of nowhere, out of scratch,"" said Dr. Ioannis Karatzas, a professor of mathematics and statistics at Columbia. Another of his major contributions was stochastic approximation, which refined a technique by Sir Isaac Newton for finding solutions to an equation. Dr. Robbins's refinement is able to calculate solutions even when data is tainted by random errors. That technique also has practical applications, such as determining the optimal dose of a medicine. Despite his accomplishments, Dr. Robbins described his research efforts as filled with false starts. In the book ""Mathematical People: Profiles and Interviews,"" Dr. Robbins told the interviewer: ""Most of the time I'm just sitting there, in an almost detached manner, thinking, 'Well, here's another day's wastebasket full of paper. Nothing's come through. Maybe another day. Maybe I should stay up tonight and try some more.' "" Even when making a discovery, ""I feel like someone who has climbed a little mountain the wrong way,"" he said. Herbert E. Robbins was born Jan. 12, 1915, in New Castle, Pa. He received his undergraduate degree from Harvard in 1935 and obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics there three years later. He first taught at New York University, then at the University of North Carolina before he joined Columbia University as a professor of mathematical statistics in 1953. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was past president of the Institute for Mathematical Statistics. After retiring from Columbia in 1985, Dr. Robbins became a professor of mathematical statistics at Rutgers. He retired from Rutgers in 1997. His first marriage, to Mary Dimock, ended in divorce in 1955. He is survived by his wife, Carol; a sister, Francie Shumsky of Atlantic City; two daughters from his first marriage, Susannah Robbins of Cambridge, Mass., and Marcia Robbins of Seattle; three children from his second marriage, Mark and Emily Robbins, both of New York City, and Dr. David Robbins of Philadelphia; and two grandchildren."

Mr. Briggs, a native of Armstrong, Mo., and a journalism graduate of the University of Missouri, worked for newspapers in Missouri and Oklahoma before acquiring the Macon paper. Five-Term State Senator He got into politics in 1930 when he became the first Democrat in 52 years to be elected Mayor of Macon. Two years later he was elected to his first of five terms in the Missouri Senate, where he served as President pro tem for four terms. When Truman, running with Franklin D. Roosevelt, was elected Vice President in 1944 he resigned his Senate seat, and Gov. Phil M. Donnelly named Mr. Briggs to serve the remainder of the term, which expired in 1946. Mr. Briggs sought a full term in 1946 but lost to his Republican opponent, James Kem. Returning to Macon, he became a member and four-term chairman of the Missouri Conservation Commission, serving until President John F. Kennedy named him Assistant Secretary of the Interior for fish and wildlife in 1961. He left that post in 1965. In 1958 the University of Missouri honored him and his column, ""It Seems to B,"" with an award for distinguished journalism, saying he had ""achieved the nearly impossible feat of keeping his newspaper and his public responsibilities entirely divorced from one another."" Besides his son, who also lives in Macon, Mr. Briggs is survived by his wife of 76 years, the former Catherine Shull; two daughters, Ruth Bratek of Columbia, Mo., and Betty Briggs of Macon; a sister, Margaret Bullock of Kansas City, 11 grandchildren and several great-grandchildren."

Morrison, who commanded the fleet during the Gulf of Tonkin incident that led to an escalation of the Vietnam War and whose son Jim was the lead singer of the Doors, died Nov. 17 in Coronado, Calif.","George S. Morrison, who commanded the fleet during the Gulf of Tonkin incident that led to an escalation of the Vietnam War and whose son Jim was the lead singer of the Doors, died Nov. 17 in Coronado, Calif. He was 89 and lived in Coronado. He died after a fall in the hospital, his daughter, Anne Chewning, told The Associated Press. Aboard the carrier Bon Homme Richard, Mr. Morrison commanded naval forces in the gulf when the destroyer Maddox engaged three North Vietnamese torpedo boats on Aug. 2, 1964. A skirmish and confused reports of a second engagement two days later led President Lyndon B. Johnson to order airstrikes against North Vietnam and to request from Congress what became known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, allowing him to carry out further military operations without declaring war. Mr. Morrison's relationship with his famous son was difficult. In ''The Doors by the Doors'' (Hyperion, 2006), he is quoted as saying: ''I had the feeling that he felt we'd just as soon not be associated with his career. He knew I didn't think rock music was the best goal for him.'' George Stephen Morrison, known as Steve, was born in Rome, Ga. His father was a railroad worker. He graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis in 1941 and, as an ensign, witnessed the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. His wife, Clara Clarke, died in 2005. Besides his daughter, Anne, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., he is survived by his son Andrew, of Pahoa, Hawaii. Jim Morrison died in Paris in 1971. In the last year of World War II, Mr. Morrison flew combat missions over Wake Island and Honshu, Japan. After the war, he was an instructor for secret nuclear-weapons projects in Albuquerque and earned a Bronze Star in the Korean War. Mr. Morrison was promoted to rear admiral in 1967 and in 1972 became commander of naval forces in the Marianas, where he organized relief efforts for nearly 100,000 Vietnamese refugees sent to Guam in 1975. Mr. Morrison donated items of his son Jim to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, including school report cards and a Cub Scout uniform."
30105,"James Gurley, 69, Guitarist in Big Brother","James Gurley, who played guitar in Big Brother and the Holding Company, the psychedelic rock band that brought Janis Joplin to fame, died on Sunday at his home in Palm Desert, Calif.","James Gurley, who played guitar in Big Brother and the Holding Company, the psychedelic rock band that brought Janis Joplin to fame, died on Sunday at his home in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 69. The cause was a heart attack, said the band's manager, Tim Murphy. One of the central groups of San Francisco's fertile mid-1960s rock scene, Big Brother and the Holding Company took blues-based songs on long, strange, electric trips that often featured Mr. Gurley's protracted solos. In an interview in 2007 with The Desert Sun, in Palm Springs, Calif., Mr. Gurley said that his approach was inspired by the music of John Coltrane. ''I heard a lone saxophone raging like a madman,'' he said. ''And that's what developed my style: Play it like crazy.'' The son of a Detroit stunt-car driver, Mr. Gurley moved to San Francisco in the early 1960s and became a staple of the music scene there. He joined his fellow guitarists Sam Andrew and Peter Albin to form Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1965. At the suggestion of the band's manager, Chet Helms, Joplin joined as lead singer in June 1966 and the group quickly shot to fame. After performing at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, Big Brother was aggressively pursued by Clive Davis of Columbia Records. Following months of negotiations to extract the band from an earlier record contract, Columbia signed the group for about $250,000, according to Fredric Dannen's book ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music Business'' (Random House, 1990). ''Cheap Thrills,'' the band's first album for Columbia, went to No. 1 and became one of the biggest hits of 1968. The group's single ''Piece of My Heart'' reached No. 12 on the Billboard pop chart. But by the end of 1968 Joplin had left the group to embark on a solo career. Big Brother and the Holding Company recorded two albums without her before disbanding in 1972. Joplin died of a heroin overdose in 1970. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, without her former band. ''They invited us to come and play for the induction of her,'' Mr. Gurley told The Desert Sun in 2007. ''And we did it. My picture's in there with her, but I'm not in the official list of inductees. That hurts.'' Mr. Gurley continued to play music after Big Brother's breakup. He performed with a reunited version of the band from 1987 to 1997. His survivors include his wife, Margaret, and two sons, Django and Hongo."
32779,"Diana McLellan, 76, Dies; Gossip Columnist With an Ear to Washington","Diana McLellan, a grande dame of Washington gossip who perforated the pretentious, skewered the powerful and sometimes felt honor-bound to keep fact-checkers from coming between her bons mots and her ''darlings,'' as she called the devoted readers of her syndicated newspaper column, died on Thursday in Easton, Md.","Diana McLellan, a grande dame of Washington gossip who perforated the pretentious, skewered the powerful and sometimes felt honor-bound to keep fact-checkers from coming between her bons mots and her ''darlings,'' as she called the devoted readers of her syndicated newspaper column, died on Thursday in Easton, Md. She was 76. The cause was cancer, a family spokesman said. Mrs. McLellan, who was born in Britain, established her reputation as the capital's most delicious read during a relatively brief, cometlike span of 10 years. She created her arch, mischievous persona as chief writer of the column The Ear in The Washington Star in 1975, then moved to The Washington Post when The Star folded in 1981. After a year at The Post, she wrote a column called Diana Hears for The Washington Times until 1985 and then became an editor at Washingtonian magazine. In her gossip heyday at The Star, Mrs. McLellan was the must-read who chronicled the mating habits of cabinet secretaries, members of Congress and other ''Terrifics,'' as she referred to the constantly changing gallery of power players in town; explained the courtship vicissitudes of prominent couples like the Washington Post reporter Sally Quinn and her boss, Ben Bradlee (''the Fun Couple,'' as she called them, until Mr. Bradlee became her boss); and generally treated the most status-conscious grandees in the world like another funny-hat crowd in town for a Moose meeting or a frozen-food convention. ''Spelling people's names wrong sometimes helps keep them humble,'' she once wrote, explaining her proclivity for misspellings and more serious mistakes. She added, with a dash of sheepishness, ''Does not work in Zbigniew Brzezinski.'' ''She was mesmerizing,'' said Chuck Conconi, who succeeded her as The Post's gossip columnist. ''This is a city that's afraid of itself. They had never seen anything like it and haven't since.'' When The Ear made a mistake, Mrs. McLellan wrote a correction -- more like a mea culpa, or, as she called it, a ''grovel.'' Jim Bellows, the Star editor during her tenure, quoted her in his 2002 memoirs, ''The Last Editor,'' as explaining that she used even her grovels for entertainment. ''If our victim was inappropriately indignant,'' Mr. Bellows recalled her telling him, ''we added enough details to our correction so that he wished to God he'd kept his mouth shut.'' Sometimes her victim was beyond further punishment. Spying the name ''D. Acheson'' on a party guest list during Jimmy Carter's presidency, she placed the former secretary of state Dean Acheson among the Terrifics spotted there. ''Ear writhed with anguish to learn that Dean Acheson, whom it had listed among Terrifics whooping it up at a divine party recently, is a teensy bit dead, and has been for ages,'' she wrote after being informed that he had died in 1971. She made her most serious mistake soon after she moved to The Post in 1981, when she reported -- incorrectly -- that President Carter had bugged Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, to eavesdrop on Ronald and Nancy Reagan in the days before Mr. Carter left office and Mr. Reagan was sworn in. Mr. Carter threatened to sue, The Post ran a correction, and Mrs. McLellan soon left for The Washington Times. ''They had lawyers at her elbow, looking at every word she wrote,'' Mr. Conconi said. Mrs. McLellan maintained a philosophical distance from her mistakes. Journalistic errors paled in comparison with what she considered the greatest of human failings: being boring. ''It's as though the Jacuzzi of Washington has been turned off and everyone is sitting around wet, waiting for towels,"" she said, describing the transition from the Reagan presidency to that of George Bush. ''It's so very quiet.'' Diana Blanche Dicken was born on Sept. 22, 1937, in Leicester, England. She came to Washington in 1957 with her father, a British military attach, and stayed on. She is survived by her husband, Richard X. McLellan Jr.; a daughter from a previous marriage, Fiona Weeks; a sister; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Asked once what kind of news or rumor she would not print in her column, Mrs. McLellan replied, ''Nothing that makes people feel creepy when they read it, like tragedies about children.'' And, she added, ''I don't think I should be the first person to let someone know her husband is having an affair.''"
1138,"R. B. Kitaj, 74, Painter Of Moody Human Dramas","itaj, an American artist who became influential in Britain with figurative and Pop Art paintings that ran against the grain of 1960s and '70s abstraction, died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles.","R. B. Kitaj, an American artist who became influential in Britain with figurative and Pop Art paintings that ran against the grain of 1960s and '70s abstraction, died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 74. His death was confirmed by Tara K. Reddi, vice president of Marlborough Fine Art in New York, the gallery that represented Mr. Kitaj in the United States. The cause of death was not given. Later in his career, Mr. Kitaj (pronounced kit-EYE) celebrated Jewish culture and his Jewish identity in his art. But he emerged professionally as part of the British Pop Art movement in the early 1960s, along with artists like David Hockney and Eduardo Paolozzi. His early works merged Pop collage techniques with the brushwork of Abstract Expressionism. He also became known for tapping a wide range of art and intellectual sources, including Kafka, Kierkegaard and Walter Benjamin and painters from Titian to Cezanne. Mr. Kitaj had his first solo exhibition in 1963, at Marlborough Fine Art in London, beginning a relationship with the gallery that lasted more than 40 years. One of his most important contributions to British art came in 1976, when he organized an exhibition called ''The Human Clay'' at the Hayward Gallery in London. In his essay for the exhibition catalog, Mr. Kitaj identified a ''School of London,'' in which he included Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff and himself as central figures. The exhibition was considered controversial because it championed figurative painting at a time when abstraction reigned, particularly in the United States under the long-term tutelage of critics like Clement Greenberg. At the same time, Mr. Kitaj began to reconnect with his Jewish heritage. Paintings like ''The Jew, Etc.'' (1979) feature an alter-ego Everyman named Joe Singer, and in 1989 Mr. Kitaj published ''The First Diasporist Manifesto,'' in which he discussed the relationship between Judaism and his work. A ''Second Diasporist Manifesto,'' composed in 2005, opened with a paraphrase of Philip Roth from ''The Counterlife'': ''I've got Jew on the Brain. Jews are my Tahiti, my Giverny, my Dada, my String Theory, my Lost Horizon.'' Mr. Kitaj was born Ronald Brooks on Oct. 29, 1932, in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, near Cleveland. After his father abandoned the family, his mother married a Viennese refugee named Walter Kitaj in 1941, and Ronald adopted his surname. R. B. Kitaj studied at Cooper Union in New York and the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna in the early 1950s before marrying a fellow American student, Elsi Roessler. He worked as a merchant seaman and later as an artist in the United States Army, drawing Russian tanks for war games. Mr. Kitaj settled in London in 1958 and studied on the G.I. Bill at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in Oxford and the Royal College of London, where he met Mr. Hockney and collaborated on collages with Mr. Paolozzi. He became the first American artist since John Singer Sargent to be elected to the Royal Academy. He remained in contact with American artists, particularly the poets Robert Creeley, Charles Olson and Allen Ginsberg. Over the course of his career, retrospectives of his work were held at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 1994 Mr. Kitaj was the subject of a retrospective at the Tate Gallery in London, an honor rarely awarded to Americans. The show was received harshly by critics, who attacked the paintings and the didactic ''prefaces'' he wrote to accompany them. Afterward, Mr. Kitaj's second wife, the painter Sandra Fisher, whom he married in 1983, died of an aneurysm at 47, prompting the artist to contend that critics, on this occasion, had literally committed murder. A 1996 painting titled ''The Critic Kills'' was signed, ''By Ron and Sandra.'' After the ''Tate War,'' as he termed this episode, Mr. Kitaj moved to Los Angeles. He remained there from 1997 until his death. He is survived by his sons, Lem, a screenwriter who publishes under the name Lem Dobbs, and Max, both of Los Angeles; a daughter, Dominie, of San Diego, and three grandsons. The art critic Robert Hughes once wrote of Mr. Kitaj in Time magazine: ''He draws better than almost anyone else alive.'' Mr. Kitaj offered his own revision: ''I draw as well as any Jew who ever lived.''"
21750,"Dick Contino, 87, a Heartthrob With an Accordion","Dick Contino, whose energetic accordion playing and movie-star looks made him a teenage star in the late 1940s, but whose celebrity ebbed after he was imprisoned for evading induction into the draft, died on April 19 in Fresno, Calif.","Dick Contino, whose energetic accordion playing and movie-star looks made him a teenage star in the late 1940s, but whose celebrity ebbed after he was imprisoned for evading induction into the draft, died on April 19 in Fresno, Calif. He was 87. His wife, Judy, confirmed his death. For a time, Mr. Contino was a show business rarity: a heartthrob accordionist who earned up to $4,000 a week in nightclubs. ''Dick Contino is one of the few men in musical history who have ever squeezed big money out of an accordion,'' Time magazine wrote in 1951. With muscled arms built up with barbells and Charles Atlas's dynamic tension exercises, Mr. Contino played the accordion like a rock star. His fingers flew over the keys. Elvis-like, he wiggled, shook and swaggered. He played polkas, jazz, romantic songs, show tunes and folk music. And, of course, ''Lady of Spain.'' But his onstage physicality belied his early shyness. ''Playing the accordion was like he was talking to you,'' his brother Victor said in an interview. Mr. Contino started playing his father's accordion and learned so well, and so quickly, that at 18 he won $5,000 in a contest staged by the popular bandleader and radio star Horace Heidt. Mr. Contino's popularity soared when he played with Mr. Heidt's band. Restless, Mr. Contino sued to break away from Mr. Heidt's contractual control, but settled and stayed for a while before leaving. Fronting his own revue, Mr. Contino sold out theaters in Milwaukee, Chicago and Pittsburgh. He was promoted as the ''Rudolph Valentino of the accordion.'' A movie about his meteoric career was being discussed. He wowed audiences at Ciro's in West Hollywood. ''He isn't just sensational,'' the gossip doyenne Hedda Hopper wrote, ''he's youth walking into your life.'' But in 1951, as the Korean War headed into its second year, Mr. Contino, then only 21, was drafted into the Army and, after reporting to Fort Ord, near Monterey, Calif., bolted before his induction, overwhelmed by persistent neuroses including claustrophobia. He said he could not stand being fenced in at Fort Ord. ''I could never describe the anxiety attack I had,'' he told The Los Angeles Times in 1982. ''I felt I had to leave.'' He wandered San Francisco and entered a sanitarium before surrendering to the F.B.I. a few days later. He was indicted on a charge of refusing to submit to induction. After pleading guilty, he was fined $10,000 and served four and a half months in the federal penitentiary at McNeil Island, Wash. He entered the Army willingly in 1952 and spent much of his two years there entertaining troops in Korea. ''These boys need entertainment,'' he told United Press while in Seoul. ''They all want to hear music. They want to forget they're here, I guess.'' Mr. Contino was pardoned in 1954 under the provisions of a general proclamation issued two years earlier by President Harry S. Truman that covered members of the armed forces who had been convicted of crimes before their induction. But despite his subsequent honorable service, the draft-dodger label dogged him. The sponsor of a proposed new band pulled out because of the publicity. The comedian Joey Bishop once brought him on as a guest on his late-night talk show, was enthusiastic about helping his career, but never had him on again. ''Why did people resent me so much for years?'' Mr. Contino asked in the interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''Why would certain shows pencil me in but never use me?'' While his career never reached its pre-draft heights, Mr. Contino performed for another 60 years. He appeared on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''; at Italian festivals in Reno, Nev., Clinton, Ind., Des Moines and Chicago; with the singer Al Martino in Florida and the impressionist Frank Gorshin in Ohio; at the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix with the orchestra leader Victor Lombardo; at Bimbo's 365 Club in San Francisco; at accordion conventions; and even at a wedding anniversary party in Yakima, Wash. Richard Joseph Contino was born on Jan. 17, 1930, in Fresno, where his parents, Pietro, a butcher, and the former Mary Giordano, ran a delicatessen. As a youngster, Mr. Contino played the piano but took up the accordion, with his father's encouragement. He had his own radio show in Fresno, on which his brother Victor turned the pages of the music for him. When Mr. Contino played a ''jive rendition'' of ''Lady of Spain'' during the first of his 13 consecutive victories in Mr. Heidt's talent contest, Parade Magazine reported that the ''bobby-sox audience howled, stamped and clapped its hands.'' He won the finals of the contest a few months after graduating from high school. He left Fresno State College to focus on his music career. Mr. Contino never stopped playing the accordion even after his draft problems and the waning of the accordion craze that he had helped create. He also had a modest career in Hollywood, appearing in a few B-movies, most notably ''Daddy-O'' (1958), in which he played a truck driver who sings in a nightclub while trying to find out who killed his best friend. That film fascinated James Ellroy, the crime writer best known for ''L.A. Confidential.'' A photograph taken of a young Mr. Ellroy shortly after being told that his mother had been murdered in 1958 eventually reignited his memories of the late 1950s, including Mr. Contino (''a man gyrating with an accordion -- pumping his 'Stomach Steinway' for all its worth'') and ''Daddy-O.'' After finding and talking to Mr. Contino, Mr. Ellroy wrote a novella, ''Dick Contino's Blues'' (1994), set in 1958 when ''Daddy-O'' was being filmed, that involves Mr. Contino's faking his own kidnapping to resurrect his career. The Contino character in the novella conjures the excitement of performing in the flush of early stardom. ''I pelvis-popped and pounded pianissimos; I cascaded cadenzas and humped harmonic hurricanes until the hogs hollered for hell -- straight through to Horace Heidt's grand finals,'' Mr. Ellroy wrote. ''I played BIG ROOMS. I cut records. I broke hearts. Screen tests, fan clubs, magazine spreads. Critics marveled at how I hipsterized the accordion -- I said all I did was make schmaltz look sexy.'' In addition to his wife, the former Judy Miller, and his brother Victor, Mr. Contino is survived by his son, Peter, who plays the accordion and drums; his daughters, Deidre Contino, a singer, and Merri Scaife; his stepchildren, Cathie and Robert Snowden; another brother, Peter; and two grandchildren. His first wife, Leigh Snowden, an actress, died in 1982. Mr. Contino was playing the accordion into his 80s, long after his hair turned white. His arms were still muscular (sometimes shown off in sleeveless shirts), and he still easily strapped on his 27-pound Petosa AM 1100 accordion to vigorously play a set list that included ''Contino Boogie.'' ''You had to see him,'' Victor Contino said. ''On his records, he was O.K. But in person, he'd play for an hour. He'd play hard and never sat down. And at the end, he'd say, 'I wish I could come to your home and play.''' Read more obituaries and follow our coverage on Twitter."

He was 82. The cause was complications of hip surgery, his daughter Tricia Leigh Fisher told The Associated Press. Mr. Fisher's pulsing delivery and boyish looks made him a lethal heartthrob for a generation of teenage girls, who thrilled to chart-topping hits like ''Wish You Were Here,'' ''I'm Walking Behind You,'' ''Oh! My Pa-Pa'' and ''I Need You Now.'' Between 1950 and 1956 he had 24 top 10 hits and nearly 50 songs in the Top 40. He reached a wide television audience on ''Coke Time With Eddie Fisher,'' which NBC broadcast from 1953 to 1957, and ''The Eddie Fisher Show,'' its successor. He was irresistible to women, and vice versa. His career suffered badly over his very public and messy divorce from Ms. Reynolds, whom he had married in 1955 and left for Ms. Taylor. The divorce became a major scandal partly because Mr. Fisher and Ms. Reynolds had been sold as Hollywood's dream couple, and partly because Ms. Taylor had been married to Mr. Fisher's best friend, the producer Mike Todd, who had died in a plane crash in 1958. The gossip columns and magazines feasted on the breakup and the romance for months, and the adverse publicity caused NBC to cancel ''The Eddie Fisher Show.'' The divorce of Mr. Fisher and Ms. Taylor was as sensational as the marriage. The smoldering romance between Richard Burton and Ms. Taylor, ignited on the set of ''Cleopatra,'' burst into flame before an eagerly watching world, and in 1964 the storied Fisher-Taylor marriage came to an end. Mr. Fisher, a worldwide object of derision as the ousted party, bounced back by marrying the singer Connie Stevens, the third of his five wives. In his heyday Mr. Fisher was romantically linked with some of Hollywood's most glamorous women, including Kim Novak, Marlene Dietrich and Angie Dickinson. His first autobiography, published in 1981, bore the almost inevitable title ''Eddie: My Life, My Loves.'' Edwin Jack Fisher was born on August 10, 1928, in Philadelphia. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia, and his early singing experience came at the local synagogue. At 13 he won a singing contest sponsored by the ''Horn and Hardart Children's Hour,'' a radio variety show, and he soon became a regular on the Philadelphia radio station WFIL, where his starting pay of 15 cents -- the price of two trolley tokens -- rose to $18 a week. ''It takes many qualities to make a good singer, but your boy has the most important quality of all,'' a local voice teacher told Mr. Fisher's mother. ''In his throat there is a thread of gold.'' While still in high school he sang his way into the Buddy Morrow band, a job that took him to New York and led to an engagement with the Charlie Ventura big band. Too young to appear in nightclubs, he found work as a staff singer at the Grossinger's resort in the Catskills, where his singing caught the attention of Eddie Cantor, who booked him in 1949 on a cross-country show. A contract with RCA followed. ''In one year, this boy will be America's most important singer of popular songs,'' Cantor predicted accurately. In 1950, the year that ''Thinking of You'' reached No. 5 on the charts, and ''Bring Back the Thrill'' and ''Unless'' cracked the top 20, Mr. Fisher was voted America's most promising new male vocalist in a poll of disc jockeys conducted by Billboard. He then commanded $1,000 a week as a headliner at the Paramount on Broadway. In 1951 he was drafted into the Army, which put him to work singing with the Army Band and touring bases overseas. ''The Army gave me a lot more than I gave it,'' Mr. Fisher told The New York Mirror in 1953. ''Why, I did shows I never would have done. In the rain, the mud, off the backs of trucks, without a mike and sometimes without even music.'' He continued to record while on furloughs and resumed his career, with scarcely a glitch, after completing his two years of service. Stepping back into the headliner role at the Paramount, he began to look like the second coming of Frank Sinatra. Seeking to capitalize on the golden Fisher-Reynolds marriage, RKO paired the couple in the musical-comedy film ''Bundle of Joy'' (1956). Mr. Fisher appeared opposite Ms. Taylor in ''Butterfield 8'' (1960), in a dramatic role that convinced him and the rest of the world that acting was not his destiny. The hits became scarcer after the mid-1950s, and RCA dropped him in 1960. He returned to the label and recorded the minor hit ''Games That Lovers Play'' in 1966. The album of the same title, made with Nelson Riddle, became his top-selling long-playing record. Mr. Fisher then entered a long slide and filed for bankruptcy in 1970. His career problems were aggravated by addictions to drugs and gambling, which he wrote about frankly in his first memoir and its successor, ''Been There, Done That'' (1999). Besides his daughter Tricia Leigh of Los Angeles, he is survived by a second daughter from his marriage to Connie Stevens, the actress Joely Fisher, also of Los Angeles; two children from his marriage to Debbie Reynolds, the actress and writer Carrie Fisher and Todd Fisher; and six grandchildren."
48992,"LAURENCE MARSHALL, RAYTHEON FOUNDER","Laurence K. Marshall, a founder and former president of the Raytheon Company, an international, diversified electronics concern, died Wednesday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass.","Laurence K. Marshall, a founder and former president of the Raytheon Company, an international, diversified electronics concern, died Wednesday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 91 years old. Mr. Marshall founded Raytheon in 1922 with the financial backing of a roommate, Vannevar Bush, the professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who, in World War II, coordinated the nation's technology, and several other investors. At that time Raytheon was a one-product company, manufacturing radio tubes. The company today employs 78,000 people worldwide in electronics, aviation, appliances, energy, construction and publishing. Under Mr. Marshall's leadership, which extended from the company's founding until his retirement in 1950, Raytheon developed many technological innovations. In World War II it played a significant role in the development of radar. An Amateur Anthropologist After he left the company, Mr. Marshall remained active as an amateur anthropologist, studying the bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in South Africa. With his family, he made eight trips to the Kalahari. Before one of his final trips, Mr. Marshall told an interviewer: ''I have had the best years of my life since retiring. I wanted to do something constructive after I retired and something that I could do with my family. We're all interested in anthropology, and we realized that little was known about the bushmen, so we decided to make a formal study of them.'' Mr. Marshall, an only child, was born in Medford, Mass. His father was a butcher, and he worked in markets while in school. He supported himself while studying at Tufts College and graduated in 1911 with a degree in civil engineering. His first job after college was with General Electric, where he earned $16 a week as a trainee. He then worked in New York City as an engineer on an East River subway tunnel. Served in France When the United States entered World War I, Mr. Marshall joined the Army as a second lieutenant and served in France. After the war, he returned to Boston, a 30-year-old civil engineer with modest savings. He got in touch with a friend, C.G. Smith, an inventor who had created several refinements in home radios. Mr. Marshall, Mr. Bush and Mr. Smith founded the Raytheon Company in Cambridge. He met his wife, Lorna Jean McLean, a Radcliffe graduate, in 1922 and they were married the same year. The Marshalls were residents of Cambridge. Mr. Marshall was award an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Tufts in 1961 and also served the institution as a trustee. In addition to his wife, he leaves a son, John, of Watertown, Mass.; a daughter, Elizabeth Thomas of Great Falls, Va., and three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held Wednesday at 3 P.M. at Harvard University's Memorial Church in Cambridge."

A sharp rivalry between General Ho and Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, commander of American forces in China, Burma and India, who had been named Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek, preceded his removal. Gen. George C. Marshall, then Army Chief of Staff, was said to have written President Roosevelt in March 1943 criticizing General Ho as favoring a ''watch and wait'' policy. President Roosevelt was said to have proposed to Chiang, in September 1944, that General Stilwell be placed in ''unrestricted command'' of Chinese Nationalist forces. General Ho was removed as Minister of War in November 1944 and made Commander in Chief of the Chinese Army. In that position, he accepted the surrender of one million Japanese troops in Nanjing Sept. 9, 1945. This was a week after General Douglas MacArthur had accepted the Japanese surrender on behalf of the Allies aboard the U.S.S. Missouri. General Ho was among a dozen generals who fled mainland China for Taiwan in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek after losing the civil war to the Communists. He then served as Taiwan's Defense Minister from 1949 to 1958. He was also at one time president of the Red Cross Society in Taiwan. He was born in China, but received much of his early military training in Japan. He was a military leader during Chiang Kai-shek's struggle for power and was named Minister of War two years after the formal establishment of the National Government in 1928. In 1946 he served as Chinese delegate to the military staff committee of the United Nations and chief of the Chinese military mission to the United States. He returned to China in early 1948 and, with the Nationalists' position in the civil war deteriorating, was made Minister of Defense. In March 1949 he was named Prime Minister but served only a little more than two months before resigning at the end of May. On Taiwan, he was named chairman of the Strategic Advisory Commission and became a member of the central advisory committee of the Kuomintang. In later years he became active in the Moral Rearmament Movement. A widower, he is survived by a daughter, Li Chu."

14306,"Katy Feeney, 68, Overseer of Baseball's Scheduling","Katy Feeney, a longtime senior executive for Major League Baseball, died on Saturday in Maine while visiting relatives.","Katy Feeney, a longtime senior executive for Major League Baseball, died on Saturday in Maine while visiting relatives. She was 68. Major League Baseball announced her death but did not specify a cause or where she died in Maine. Baseball officials said she died in her sleep and had not shown any sign of illness. She lived in New York. Ms. Feeney, a daughter of a former National League president, retired in December, ending a nearly 40-year career with Major League Baseball after working her final postseason. She was hired by the National League in 1977 and rose to Major League Baseball's senior vice president for club relations and scheduling. She was an expert on the complicated rules governing the schedule. ''Overseeing the schedule, Katy long held one of the most challenging positions in the sport,'' the commissioner's office said in a statement. It added, ''She was one of the leading pioneers to the female executives of our game.'' Ms. Feeney was born into one of baseball's most prominent families. Her father, Charles S. Feeney, who was known as Chub, was a grandson of Charles Stoneham, the New York Giants' controlling owner from 1919 to 1936, and a nephew of Horace Stoneham, who owned the team from 1936 to 1976 and moved it to San Francisco after the 1957 season. Chub Feeney became a Giants vice president, and by 1950 he was essentially the club's general manager. He served as National League president from late 1969 until 1986, and was the San Diego Padres' president for a little over a year, in 1987 and 1988. Born in 1949, Katy Feeney, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, had worked in a variety of jobs -- as a waitress, a teacher's aide, a gas station attendant and a probation officer -- when she joined the National League. ''I went in to help out temporarily for a couple of weeks, to fill in for a P.R. secretary who was leaving,'' she once told Major League Baseball for a career profile. ''When the offices moved to New York City, I was asked if I would go to help out for a year.'' She added, ''It's been a long year.'' She was promoted to assistant director of public relations in 1979 and became director of media and public affairs in December 1986. As part of that role, she introduced National League players on the podium during the postseason and All-Star Games. After the merger of the National League and the American League with the commissioner's office in 2000, she became the point person on scheduling, particularly when weather caused havoc. Ms. Feeney is survived by her brothers, John, Stoney and Will; a sister, Mary; and eight nieces and nephews, the Giants organization said. Read more obituaries and follow our coverage on Twitter."
36750,"MARTIN PROVENSEN, ILLUSTRATOR; SPECIALIST IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS","Martin Provensen, an award-winning illustrator of children's books, died of a heart attack at his home in Clinton Corners, N.Y., Friday.","Martin Provensen, an award-winning illustrator of children's books, died of a heart attack at his home in Clinton Corners, N.Y., Friday. He was 70 years old. Mr. Provensen and his wife, Alice, also an illustrator, worked as a team for more than 40 years, illustrating scores of children's books, including a children's version of the Bible. An early success came with their illustrations for the ''Fireside Book of Folk Songs,'' which became a classic after its publication in 1947 during a revival of interest in folk singing. A Wide Range of Work Their work covered a range of children's literature, from such simple stories as ''Katie the Kitten,'' in 1949, to ''The Glorious Flight: Across the Channel with Louis Bleriot,'' in 1983, which they also wrote. The latter book, the story of a French aviator who in 1909 became the first person to cross the English Channel in an airplane, earned them the prestigious Randolph Caldecott Medal for the best picture book published in the United States in 1983. Their style embodied ''warm colors, and it was almost impressionist,'' said Bruce Harris of Crown, one of their publishers. They often received mention on The New York Times Book Review's annual list of best-illustrated children's books. ''We work together on everything,'' Mr. Provensen once said. ''This would not be possible, of course, if it were not true that we really think in the same artistic terms. We like the flat, decorative modern technique, influenced by Persian miniatures and Italian primitives.'' 'So Close and Productive' ''I can't think of another working relationship between artists that was so close and so productive,'' said a longtime friend of the Provensens, Robert Gottlieb, who is the editor of The New Yorker. ''And this was a reflection of their closeness and mutual generosity as a married couple.'' Mr. Provensen was born July 10, 1916, in Chicago. His wife, the former Alice Twitchell, was also born in Chicago. Both won scholarships to the Chicago Art Institute, and both transferred to the University of California. But they did not meet until World War II, when the Navy assigned Mr. Provensen to create animated training films at the Walt Disney Studios, where Miss Twitchell was making animated cartoons. They were married in 1944. Besides his wife, Mr. Provensen is survived by a daughter, Karen, and his mother, Berendina Provensen, both of Glendale, Calif."
20621,"Dr. Ted Stanley, 77; Developed Fentanyl-Laced Lollipop","Ted Stanley, an anesthesiologist and medical entrepreneur who, with a colleague, created the fentanyl lollipop, a palatable means of delivering a synthetic opioid analgesic, mostly to cancer patients, died on July 13 in Salt Lake City.","Ted Stanley, an anesthesiologist and medical entrepreneur who, with a colleague, created the fentanyl lollipop, a palatable means of delivering a synthetic opioid analgesic, mostly to cancer patients, died on July 13 in Salt Lake City. He was 77. The cause was complications of prostate cancer, according to the University of Utah, where Dr. Stanley conducted research for 50 years and which, along with him and his drug company, reaped millions of dollars in profits from his discovery. Though prescribed primarily in cancer treatment, the fentanyl-laced lollipop, a sugary, fruit-flavored confection on a plastic stick, has also been used to relieve migraine and cluster headaches, severe back and bone pain, arthritis and other chronic conditions. But like other products containing fentanyl, a synthetic drug that is a hundred times more powerful than morphine or oxycodone, the lollipop formulation has also proved vulnerable to abuse by opiate addicts. They get the product from forged prescriptions, doctors who fraudulently overprescribe, patients who distribute it illicitly and illegal laboratories. Some steal it from pharmacies. It is sold under several generic names, including perc-o-pop. The lollipop version was invented by Dr. Stanley and Brian I. Hague in 1983 and approved by federal regulators in 1998 to treat cancer pain under the name Actiq. Their patent was assigned to the University of Utah Research Foundation. The product was considered a breakthrough because it could be sucked or swabbed in the mouths of patients, including children and old people, who had an aversion to vaccinations or had difficulty swallowing pills. It grew out of research that Dr. Stanley and colleagues had been conducting in Sacramento, Calif., on an even more potent variety of fentanyl called carfentanil, which was used in darts to subdue game animals and was even considered for use as a weapon against terrorists. ''A veterinarian colleague one day wondered whether carfentanil could be injected into the sugar cubes that some of the study team were using that day in their coffee,'' Dr. Stanley recalled in 2014 in The Journal of Pain. The colleague wondered whether a sugar cube loaded with carfentanil could be used effectively to immobilize monkeys who become frazzled when they were placed in a restraining cage before receiving injections. ''He knew that monkeys love to suck on sugar cubes,'' Dr. Stanley wrote. Within an hour, they tested their theory on a monkey. ''With a couple of sucks on the sugar cube, he was down, and safely,'' Dr. Stanley later recalled. Flying back to Salt Lake City, he said, he wondered, ''How could we do this with people? And that's where the idea of the drug in a lollipop and giving it to a child who needed to have surgery'' was born. ''I said, 'What if we had a lollipop that had one of these drugs in it?' '' he told NPR in 2010, '' 'and you give the lollipop to the child and then boom, they would be relaxed, they'd go to sleep?' Then you could take them from their parents; it would be so stressless, and so nice.'' In 1985, he and his business partner, William Moeller, founded Anesta Corporation to market the lollipop sedative. Anesta went public in 1994. In 2000, it was sold for nearly $450 million to Cephalon (which has since been acquired by Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical company). The fentanyl citrate is absorbed in the bloodstream within 20 minutes -- as quickly as an injection. That made it useful to treat soldiers injured in the field and in hospital operating and emergency rooms, where quick treatment can be less costly than lengthier drug regimens. The fentanyl in the lollipop retains its potency because, unlike a medicinal patch or a chewed, crumbled lozenge, it is not first digested and then metabolized by the liver. Rather, it is absorbed into veins in the mouth, pharynx and esophagus. Moreover, the lollipop can be self-administered and removed when a patient who is being monitored has received the proper dose. The normal dosage contains about two grams of sugar (well below the American Heart Association's recommended daily intake of 36 grams for men and 25 for women), but the lollipop has been known to cause tooth decay. [Video: Faculty profile: Ted Stanley Watch on YouTube.] Theodore Henry Stanley was born on Feb. 4, 1940, in Manhattan. His father, also named Ted, was a New York City police inspector. His mother, the former Ellen Kasekevitch, was a corrections officer. He graduated from Bushwick High School in Brooklyn. Dr. Stanley grew up as a die-hard fan of the hapless Brooklyn Dodgers. But when his dreams of playing center field in the big leagues faded, and after he concluded that he could not make a living as a musician, either (he played nine instruments), he said he decided on a medical career as a last resort. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in zoology, chemistry and music from Columbia College in 1961, followed by a medical degree from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. Studying under a fellowship at the University of Utah, he planned on becoming a cardiac surgeon but added anesthesiology as a specialty. Dr. Stanley served in the Air Force at the medical center of Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Tex. He joined the Utah faculty in 1972, becoming a professor of surgical research and director of research at the university's School of Medicine. At Utah, Dr. Stanley worked with Dr. Willem Kolff, considered the father of artificial organs, and he was a member of the team that in 1982 implanted the first permanent artificial heart in a human patient, Barney Clark, a 61-year-old dentist, who survived for four months. At Utah, he was also a pioneer in partnering with private industry to subsidize medical research and development as federal financial support was shrinking. He later became managing director of UpStart Ventures, which invests in innovative life sciences companies. Dr. Stanley wrote or contributed to scores of books and was frequently published in medical journals. In 2000 he considered the state of anesthesia in modern medicine. ''Anesthetic delivery has not appreciably changed in the past 150 years,'' he wrote. ''We still give drugs using needles. We still ask patients to breathe the vapors of very potent volatile liquids -- drugs that could take the paint off a car. We still ask patients to swallow pills and solutions, some of which actually produce the desired effect some of the time.'' But he was optimistic that significant progress was not far-off. He predicted that newer anesthetics, some of which might mimic animal hibernation, ''promise improved convenience, improved safety, increased effectiveness, increased bioavailability, continuous delivery with fewer peaks and valleys, decreased side effects, decreased dosage and frequency of administration, and decreased cost.''"

He was 94 and lived in Manhattan. He died in his sleep, said Neal Hade, a friend. Mr. Smeck's career spanned 75 years, during which he performed for several American Presidents and at the coronation of King George VI of England in 1937. He collaborated with many well-known musicians, including Irving Berlin and W. C. Handy in live performances and on more than 500 recordings. Mr. Smeck went into vaudeville after appearing in the short film ""Pastimes,"" which featured musicians performing and was the opening for ""Don Juan,"" the first sound motion picture made by Warner Brothers, in 1926. He became more widely known when he began giving music lessons during his show on WOR radio in New York. An avid teacher, he wrote 50 books on how to play stringed instruments. Among his guitar students was Gene Autry. A 1982 documentary about his life, entitled ""Wizard of the Strings,"" was nominated for an Academy Award. As a tribute to him, several instrument manufacturers, including the Gibson Guitar Corporation and the Bacon and Day Banjo Company, produced instruments bearing the Roy Smeck logo, and on April 1 Gibson reissued the 1934 Roy Smeck Radio Grande guitar as a limited edition.

Buechner, who led the Brooklyn Museum through an ambitious renovation as its director in the 1960s and who was the founding director of the Corning Museum of Glass, died on Sunday at his home in Corning, N.Y. He was 83. The cause was lymphoma, his daughter, Bohn Whitaker, said. Mr. Buechner, a painter and illustrator on the side, served for 10 years as the director of the Corning Museum of Glass before becoming director of the Brooklyn Museum in 1960. At 33, he was one of the youngest museum directors in the United States. His signal accomplishment in Brooklyn was to oversee a decade-long program that brought the building up to modern museum standards, with proper temperature and humidity controls and study galleries for all departments. Disturbed by the number of works in storage, unavailable to visitors and scholars, he transformed the space into what he called an open-study storage gallery that put more than 1,000 paintings on display. As part of the renovation, Mr. Buechner (pronounced BEAK-ner) created a sculpture garden featuring architectural gems, like Louis Sullivan's capitals from the Bayard-Condict Building on Bleecker Street, that the museum had salvaged from demolished buildings. After a subsequent museum renovation that lasted from 1986 to 2004, it was reopened as the Steinberg Family Sculpture Garden. Mr. Buechner also rescued Daniel Chester French's allegorical figures representing Manhattan and Brooklyn, formerly on the Brooklyn plaza of the Manhattan Bridge, and placed them on either side of the museum's main entrance. The bridge approaches on both sides were reconfigured in the early 1960s, and the sculptures had to go. Thomas Scharman Buechner was born on Sept. 25, 1926, in Manhattan and grew up in Bronxville, N.Y. After graduating from the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, he enlisted in the Navy, which sent him to the Naval Air Corps training program at Princeton University. Keen to learn Spanish, Mr. Buechner went to Puerto Rico after the war and spent a year developing promotional material for the island's tourist board. Returning to New York, he studied at the Art Students League while working as a night elevator operator at the Plaza Hotel to pay his tuition. He then studied painting in Paris and Amsterdam. In 1949 he married Mary Hawkins, who survives him. In addition to his daughter, Bohn, of Brookline, Mass., he is survived by two sons, Thomas S. Buechner III, of Corning, and Matthew, of Newport, R.I.; two sisters, Nancy Lewis of Marathon, Fla., and Betsy Buechner Morris of Marblehead, Mass; and seven grandchildren. Doubtful about his ability to make a career as an artist, Mr. Buechner accepted a job as assistant manager of the display department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. When the Corning Glass Works created the Corning Museum of Glass in south central New York State, he was named its first director and served in the position from 1951 to 1960. Mr. Buechner established the museum as a scholarly institution whose exhibitions on ancient and contemporary glass traveled to museums around the country. He founded two professional journals, The Journal of Glass Studies and New Glass Review. After resigning from the Brooklyn Museum in 1971, he returned to Corning Glass, where he became president of its Steuben Glass division in 1973, a position he held until 1982. He also served again as director of the Corning Museum of Glass from 1973 to 1980. After retiring from Corning in 1987, he returned to painting full time, executing portraits, landscapes and still lifes. His portrait of Alice Tully, a granddaughter of the founder of Corning Glass, hangs in Alice Tully Hall in Lincoln Center. His books included ''Norman Rockwell: Artist and Illustrator'' (1970) and ''How I Paint'' (2000)."

In 1965 he became the director of the family life bureau of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. In 1971 Father McHugh was appointed papal chamberlain by Pope Paul VI, and Pope John Paul II made him a prelate of honor in 1986. In 1972, Father McHugh became the National Conference of Catholic Bishops' first director of pro-life activities, said Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, a spokesman for the conference. Bishops in the United States looked to Bishop McHugh and a handful of other prelates to articulate the church's position on human life issues, Monsignor Maniscalco said. Bishop McHugh also specialized in demography and population matters, traveling to three United Nations conferences on population and three international conferences on women with the Vatican's delegation. Part of his job was to help rebut what the Roman Catholic Church sees as exaggerated projections of world population growth, Monsignor Maniscalco said, and to encourage policies of economic development rather than population control. ""He was a tenacious defender of innocent human life,"" said John Carr, the director of social development and world peace for the bishops conference. ""Part of it was loyalty to the church's teachings, and part of it was his conviction that this was the moral measure of our society."" After leaving the conference, he went to graduate school in Rome, where he earned a graduate degree in moral theology in 1981. In 1987 he was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Newark, and was ordained a bishop in 1988. The following year, he became the bishop of Camden, where he focused on encouraging Catholic education and on drawing men to the priesthood, said Monsignor Maniscalco. Although some of his time in the Diocese of Rockville Centre, which covers Nassau and Suffolk Counties, was consumed by his battle against cancer, he did complete negotiations with the teachers of the diocese's two Catholic high schools, ensuring that the teachers' contracts contained a clause saying that the teacher supported the Catholic faith and teachings, Mrs. Novarro said. Bishop McHugh is survived by his mother, Caroline Scavone McHugh, and a sister, Sharon Foster. Mrs. Novarro said that the Vatican had not yet chosen a successor for Bishop McHugh, and that a group of priests in the diocese would choose an administrator in the interim. Bishop McHugh was with Cardinal John J. O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, in the last hours before the cardinal died in May. And Sunday, Archbishop Edward M. Egan of New York said he and Bishop McHugh had been friends since the 1960's. ""During these months of illness, he continued to preach the sanctity of life,"" Archbishop Egan said. ""Only now he added his own example of the beauty of life, even when it is attended by sickness and suffering."" http://www.nytimes.com"
22341,"Robert Fizdale, 75, for 30 Years Half of a Celebrated Piano Duo","Robert Fizdale, a pianist, biographer, gastronome and for more than 30 years a partner in the piano duo known as Gold and Fizdale, died on Wednesday in Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.","Robert Fizdale, a pianist, biographer, gastronome and for more than 30 years a partner in the piano duo known as Gold and Fizdale, died on Wednesday in Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 75. The cause was Alzheimer's disease. Mr. Fizdale and Arthur Gold, who died in 1990, brought a seamless perfection to Mozart's two-piano works. They expressed an inimitable joie de vivre in Brahms's ""Liebeslieder"" waltzes for two pianos and four voices, rediscovered and revived two early two-piano concertos by Mendelssohn and won praise for their rendition of Bartok's redoubtable Concerto for Two Pianos and Percussion. But what they really liked was to persuade living composers to write something new for them. Their New York debut recital at the New School for Social Research in 1944 was an evening of music by John Cage that included two works written for the occasion. Over the next 20 and more years they became as well known in Paris and Rome as in New York. Francis Poulenc wrote a sonata for them. Darius Milhaud, Georges Auric, Henri Sauguet and Germaine Tailleferre also wrote for them. So did Virgil Thomson, Samuel Barber and Ned Rorem in the United States and Luciano Berio in Italy. In 1982 an arthritic finger forced Mr. Fizdale to retire from the concert platform. He and Mr. Gold had already begun a second career as biographers, first in 1980 with a book about Misia Sert, an intimate friend of Diaghilev, and again in 1991 with ""The Divine Sarah: A Life of Sarah Bernhardt."" Both books reflected their deep knowledge of France and the French. Robert Fizdale was born in Chicago on April 12, 1920, the son of Russian immigrants. Music ran in his family; his grandfather, at 13, played the flute in the service of Czar Nicholas II. Young Robert showed a marked talent for performance, both in music and in amateur theatricals. At the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, he studied piano under Louise Robyn, and won a scholarship to the Juilliard School in New York, where he arrived in 1939 and studied under Ernst Hutchinson. It was while he was at Juilliard that he met Mr. Gold, who was also a student, with whom he was to found a piano duo in 1943. Based on congruity of taste, it was a true marriage of musical minds. In their homes in Water Mill, L.I., and Manhattan, Mr. Fizdale and Mr. Gold practiced a truly Russian style of hospitality. As one old friend said, ""With very little money, they showed the rich how to live."" In 1984 they published their ""Gold and Fizdale Cookbook."" As witty as it is practical, it is part manual, part autobiography. Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, among poets, George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, among men of the theater, and Louis Begley, among novelists, were among those who delighted in their food. One of their unfinished projects was a long series of interviews with Balanchine, with whom they shared a lifelong passion for cooking and a love of ballet. The French Government appointed Mr. Fizdale a Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He is survived by a brother, Walter, of Chicago."

1102,"Fausto Vitello, 59, Is Dead; Made Skateboarding Gnarly","Fausto Vitello, an entrepreneur and publisher who helped take the dying pastime of skateboarding out of the suburbs and into the streets, where it became a rude and riotous multibillion-dollar business, died Saturday while riding his bicycle in Woodside, Calif.","Fausto Vitello, an entrepreneur and publisher who helped take the dying pastime of skateboarding out of the suburbs and into the streets, where it became a rude and riotous multibillion-dollar business, died Saturday while riding his bicycle in Woodside, Calif. He was 59 and lived in Hillsborough, Calif. The apparent cause was a heart attack, his family said. Mr. Vitello was revered by skateboarders (and reviled by their parents) as a founder and the president of Thrasher magazine, which for a quarter-century has been the rebellious bible of the skateboarding subculture. He was also a founder of Independent Trucks, a leading manufacturer of skateboard equipment, clothing and accessories. ''He's the godfather of punk-rock skateboarding,'' Michael Brooke, the publisher of Concrete Wave, a skateboarding magazine based in Toronto, said in a telephone interview yesterday. Published monthly, Thrasher has a circulation of about 175,000. Its Web site, thrashermagazine.com, features articles, interviews and, for school-age readers, a selection of downloadable term papers ''to free up more time to skate.'' Skateboarding has been around since the early 1900's, when some thrill-seeking child first nailed a two-by-four to a roller skate. Conditions improved in late 1950's, when the first commercial skateboards were marketed, and again in the early 70's, when urethane wheels and better boards made fancy maneuvers possible. By the mid-70's, skateboarding was hugely popular among suburban boys, who performed in empty swimming pools and in specially built skateboard parks. By the end of the decade, however, many towns, concerned about liability, razed their parks, and the sport went into decline. But it was still possible to skate in the streets, using features of the urban landscape -- curbs, steps, railings, benches -- as launching pads from which to take flight. Mr. Vitello, a devoted skateboarder who had founded Independent Trucks in 1978, capitalized on the fledgling sport of street skating, starting Thrasher with several associates in 1981. With its mantra ''skate and destroy,'' the magazine embodied the punk-rock ethos of the day, exhorting readers to devote their lives to their art. And if the pursuit of art happened to involve some imbibing and inhaling, it implied, that was all right, too. ''Thrasher magazine has had its detractors,'' Mr. Brooke said. ''Fausto and Thrasher had no problem being very -- how can I put this? -- gnarly. There are swear"

He was 70 years old and had been suffering from a heart ailment. Mr. Twomey, former manager of a bookmaker's shop, was a founding member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, which was established after the resumption of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland in 1969. The Provisional, or ''green,'' I.R.A. split at that time from the Marxist Official, or ''red,'' I.R.A. As the Provisionals' chief of staff, he flew to London in 1972 for cease-fire talks with the British Government. But the lull was short-lived. On July 7, 1972, the I.R.A. set off 22 bombs across Belfast, killing nine people. It became known as ''Bloody Friday,'' one of the deadliest episodes in the 20-year campaign by the I.R.A. to oust Britain from the north. Mr. Twomey was arrested in the Irish Republic in 1973 but escaped by helicopter from Mountjoy Prison in Dublin. He was arrested again in December 1977 and was given a five-year prison term. After his release in January 1982 he remained active in the republican movement and made political appearances in the United States, apparently avoiding a ban on entry to the United States by using an anglicized version of his first name, calling himself James Twomey. Gerry Adams, president of the I.R.A.'s legal political arm, Sinn Fein, paid tribute Tuesday to Mr. Twomey's ''lifelong commitment to the cause of Irish freedom.''"

41358,"JOSE DE CREEFT, 97, SCULPTOR, IS DEAD","Jose de Creeft, a sculptor, teacher and leading exponent of the direct method of sculpture, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan.","Jose de Creeft, a sculptor, teacher and leading exponent of the direct method of sculpture, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 97 years old and also had a home and studio in Hoosick Falls, N.Y. Mr. de Creeft, who was born in Spain, lived and worked in France for many years before coming to the United States in 1929. He became an American citizen in 1940. In his career in this country, Mr. de Creeft had more than 37 oneman exhibits of his sculpture, and his works are to be found in many museums. One of his better-known works in New York is his large group sculpture in bronze in Central Park titled ''Alice in Wonderland.'' In 1973, Mr. de Creeft was one of three American sculptors selected for the first permanent collection of contemporary American sculpture in Europe, in the Vatican Museum of Modern Art in Rome. Began Teaching in 1932 For more than 60 years, Mr. de Creeft advocated that sculptors work in their ultimate medium, instead of modeling a work in clay and having it cast or copied. In 1932, he began teaching, first at the New School for Social Research and then at the Art Students League. He taught at the league until four years ago. Mr. de Creeft was born in Guadalajara, Spain, on Nov. 27, 1884, and began sculpturing at the age of 11 when he was pressed into work making small Nativity figures to help support his impoverished family. With virtually no formal schooling, he gained valuable training in the artistic foundries and workshops of Barcelona and Madrid. In 1905 he moved to Paris and, following the advice of Auguste Rodin, began his first formal art training at the Academie Julien. The next year he received the first of many awards when a sculpture he did in clay, titled ''Torso,'' won the top prize in the academy's sculpture contest. Over the years, Mr. de Creeft perfected his technique in a wide variety of materials, including marble, wood and terra cotta. Perhaps more than any other artist, he is given credit for reviving in America an appreciation of the direct sculpture method. Work Widely Exhibited In 1960, when he was 75, Mr. de Creeft had his first retrospective exhibit, at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The exhibit later traveled to 13 museums, universities and galleries throughout the United States. In 1970, Mr. de Creeft began an association with the Kennedy Galleries in New York. Over the decade, the gallery held several oneman shows of the sculptor's work, culminating with a final one in 1979. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the National Academy of Design, the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the Sculptors Guild. Among his most recent honors were the Comendador de la Orden de Isabel la Catolica from Spain in 1973 and the Florence Eickeneyer Award from Columbia University in 1975. Mr. de Creeft, who was married three times, is survived by his wife, Lorrie Goulet de Creeft, who sculptures under her maiden name and teaches at the Art Students League; two sons, Christian Durupt of France, and William de Creeft of Homer, Alaska; two daughters, Nina de Creeft Ward of Cedar Falls, Iowa, and Donna Maria de Creeft Perkins of New York City, and seven grandchildren. Funeral services and burial are scheduled to be held in Hoosick Falls next Sunday. A memorial service at the Art Students League is being planned."

The services were held at the Pilgrim Baptist church, where Mr. Bell had attended services since he was a child. ''He was not the most flamboyant tailback at U.S.C., but he was the most sincere,'' said Mr. Garrett, who won the Heisman Trophy as a U.S.C. tailback in 1965.

Vincent J. Termine, a Roman Catholic priest who helped revive a dying parish in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, in the 1960s and '70s, then angered members of his predominantly white flock when he let black youths from another neighborhood participate in organized basketball at the church, died on Dec. 26 in Johns Island, S.C., where he had lived since 2009. He was 93. His death was confirmed by his brother, John. Father Termine's parish, Most Precious Blood, was in serious disrepair and its elementary school had just lost its teaching order of nuns when he was transferred there in 1967. Over the next decade he led a drive to raise more than a million dollars to rebuild the church. He also recruited a new teaching order of nuns for the school. The racial tensions flared in the midst of those efforts, in the mid-1970s, after Gerard Papa, a community-minded Brooklyn lawyer, organized a basketball league, known as the Flames, to bring together Italian-American boys from the suburban-style homes of south Brooklyn and blacks and Hispanics from the projects. Father Termine (pronounced TER-mine) agreed to let them use his church as their home base so that they would qualify to compete in Catholic Youth Organization tournaments. (Lacking a basketball court, the church offered its bingo hall for use as one.) The decision angered many parishioners. At the Flames' first practice session, bat-wielding white toughs menaced the black players whom Father Termine had welcomed to his church, on Bay 47th Street. By his account, Father Termine resolved the dispute by going to a Brooklyn social club, where he knew he could find the father of one of the bat-wielding toughs -- ''a local, ah, man of respect,'' as he described him to Robert Lipsyte, then a columnist for The New York Times, in 1994. ''He stormed into the back room,'' Mr. Lipsyte wrote, relating Father Termine's account. ''Cards and chips flew as he roared -- ('I can be dramatic when necessary') -- about Jesus and justice.'' Father Termine said the neighborhood man gave him his personal pledge of safe-conduct for the Flames. There were no further incidents. The Flames were one of the few racially integrated basketball squads in the city while they played in C.Y.O. games under the banner of Most Precious Blood Church from the mid-'70s until the late '90s. In 1997, two years after Father Termine retired, C.Y.O. officials barred them from competition after the new pastor at Precious Blood declined to continue sponsoring them, saying he had a new ''vision'' for his church's sports program. Mr. Papa contested the decision in a civil suit, but was unsuccessful. Vincent Joseph Termine was born in Brooklyn on March 4, 1920, one of five children of Charles Termine, a bus dispatcher, and his wife, Mary. He lived and worked in Brooklyn almost all his life. After graduating magna cum laude from St. John's University and receiving his religious training at Immaculate Conception Seminary in Huntington, on Long Island, Mr. Termine was ordained in 1944 and began the first of many pastoral assignments in Brooklyn. He served as assistant pastor at the Church of St. Michael-St. Edward in Fort Greene, as chaplain at the old Raymond Street Jail, and at the Cumberland Hospital. He was assigned to St. Rocco's Church in Park Slope, Saint Mark Church in Sheepshead Bay, the tuberculosis hospital in Manhattan Beach; St. Blaise Church in Crown Heights (now the Church of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Blaise), and, as Catholic chaplain, to the city Sanitation Department's Brooklyn operations. The refurbished Most Precious Blood Church reopened in 1976, and weekly attendance began to grow. Father Termine remained a resident of Brooklyn -- he had a home in Coney Island -- until he moved to South Carolina to be closer to family members. In addition to his brother John, a physician and medical researcher, he is survived by another brother, Charles Termine, a surgeon. Father Termine was something of throwback to another era. He ''seems to have come from old black-and-white movies,'' Mr. Lipsyte wrote in his 1994 column, ''a burly 74-year-old with Bible stories and wicked winks and knobby hands that have snatched away dice in back alleys and paddled whole classrooms and hacked through teenage rumbles. ''He started clubs for kids, and when they didn't show up he stomped into pool rooms and candy stores and dragged them to the church,'' Mr. Lipsyte wrote. ''He bought Ping-Pong tables with his own money. He gave confession in parked cars, bars and once in the freezer of a butcher shop. His mother had advised him to 'Nag, nag, nag,' because sooner or later the kids would remember the message, and that someone cared enough to keep delivering it to them. Father Termine still thinks it is good advice.''"

You are everyone's equal, and everyone is equal to you.'' Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, who was known as Jean, was born on July 17, 1917, to Ambrose J. Finnegan and Geraldine C. Blewitt of Scranton. In 1941 she married Joseph Robinette Biden, who died in 2002. Vice President Biden, the first of their four children, was born in 1942. While Mr. Biden has described his boyhood in postwar Scranton as idyllic, in fact his father suffered a number of business reversals, and for several years when Joe Jr. was young, the Bidens were forced to move in with his mother's parents. Besides the vice president, Mrs. Biden is survived by her daughter, Valerie Biden Owens of Kennett Square, Pa.; her two younger sons, James, of Merion Station, Pa., and Francis, of Florida; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
7400,"Donald Posner, 73, Art Historian and Baroque Scholar","Donald Posner, a leading scholar of Baroque art and 17th- and 18th-century painting in Italy and France, died on Aug. 13 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.","Donald Posner, a leading scholar of Baroque art and 17th- and 18th-century painting in Italy and France, died on Aug. 13 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 73 and lived in Manhattan. The cause was esophageal cancer, said his companion, Joan Leibovitz. At his death, Mr. Posner was Ailsa Mellon Bruce Professor of Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where he had served on the faculty since obtaining his Ph.D. there in 1962. He was deputy director of the institute from 1983 to 2002. His doctoral dissertation, on the 16th-century Italian painter Annibale Carracci and his workshop in Rome, was later expanded into a landmark book, ''Annibale Carracci: A Study in the Reform of Italian Painting Around 1590,'' published in 1971. His book on the French 18th-century painter Antoine Watteau, published in 1984, is also regarded as a classic in the field. His 1971 article for Art Quarterly, ''Caravaggio's Homo-Erotic Early Works,'' is considered an authoritative as well as tendentious text for the documentation of the painter. Born in the Bronx on Aug. 30, 1931, Donald Posner was the first in his family to attend college. He earned a B.A. from Queens College, leaving to serve as a radar specialist with the Air Force in the Korean war before returning to graduate in 1956. He earned a master's degree from Harvard in 1957, then went to the institute to pursue doctoral studies in Baroque art with the legendary Walter Friedlaender. Friedlaender, a pioneer in the re-evaluation of Baroque art, was one of the prominent refugees from Nazi Germany and Austria who brought new vigor to the field of art history in America. At the institute, Mr. Posner soon emerged as Friedlaender's heir apparent in the Baroque field. Mr. Posner's collaboration with Julius Held, another distinguished Baroque scholar who was part of the German exodus, on the book ''17th and 18th Century Art: Baroque Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'' (1972), was widely admired for its broad erudition and illuminating descriptions of styles and individual works. A connoisseur and formalist who spurned postmodern concepts like deconstructionism, Mr. Posner preferred to trust the evidence of what he saw, even if it might seem to contradict a textual document, said Mariet Westermann, director of the institute in a letter notifying colleagues of his death. Besides Ms. Leibovitz, Mr. Posner is survived by his daughter, Anne Posner of Chicago, and a sister, Phyllis Levine of Queens."
3530,"John A. McCone, Head of C.I.A. In Cuban Missile Crisis, Dies at 89","John A. McCone, a West Coast businessman who became chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and later the Director of Central Intelligence, died Thursday at his home in Pebble Beach, Calif.","John A. McCone, a West Coast businessman who became chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and later the Director of Central Intelligence, died Thursday at his home in Pebble Beach, Calif. He was 89 years old. He died of cardiac arrest, said his secretary, Chris Balog. Mr. McCone headed the Atomic Energy Commission from 1958 to 1960 and the Central Intelligence Agency from 1961 to 1965, holding two of the most sensitive high positions in Washington. He was widely credited with being the first Government official to foresee that the Soviet Union would place offensive weapons on Cuba, a move that set off the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. As chairman of the atomic energy panel a few years earlier, he sought to reach agreement with the Soviet Union to stop testing of nuclear weapons. 'Sharp, Tough and Demanding' William H. Webster, the current Director of Central Intelligence, said yesterday that Mr. McCone had made ""an enormous contribution"" to United States security. ""He guided the intelligence community during a particularly trying time,"" Mr. Webster said. ""Mr. McCone was sharp, tough and demanding -- qualities that made him a highly effective and widely respected leader. His long and distinguished career in Government was marked by excellence, integrity and selfless devotion to duty."" John Alex McCone was born in San Francisco on Jan. 4, 1902. He received an engineering degree from the University of California at Berkeley. He worked as a riveter and boilermaker and rose to superintendent of a Los Angeles iron company that merged with the Consolidated Steel Corporation in 1929. By 1933 Mr. McCone was executive vice president of Consolidated. In 1937 he left the steel business to form an engineering concern, Bechtel-McCone, with Stephen Bechtel. The company, which disbanded after World War II, designed and built refineries, power plants and other projects across the United States and in South America and the Middle East. It expanded into shipbuilding and aircraft production in the war. After the war ended, he moved into overseas shipping as president of the Joshua Hendy Corporation. Millionaire With Wide Interests He was a millionaire with varied business interests when President Harry S. Truman appointed him to the Air Policy Commission in 1947. The following year he was named a special deputy to James V. Forrestal, the Secretary of Defense. In 1950 he was made Under Secretary of the Air Force. In that post he urged President Truman to start a program of building guided missiles and put the program under a single director with full authority. That was not done, and later, critics of the missile program suggested that the ""missile gap"" between the United States and the Soviet Union in the late 1950's and early 1960's might not have developed if Mr. McCone's recommendation had been followed. He returned to private business in 1951 but continued to serve Washington on special missions. In mid-1958 President Dwight D. Eisenhower chose him to succeed Lewis Strauss as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. Sought a Nuclear Test Ban In his two years overseeing all the nation's atomic energy programs, the United States started its ""Atoms for Peace"" initiative, an effort to direct nuclear power to peaceful purposes, and he sought to reach agreement with the Soviet Union on banning nuclear weapons tests. Mr. McCone issued a stern warning shortly after he took over that the United States would continue nuclear testing unless the Soviets agreed to a one-year test ban. Although achieving a test ban proved elusive, Mr. McCone was able to sign an agreement with the Soviets in 1959 for a cooperative program of nuclear research. He had earlier reached agreement with Euratom, the six-nation European atomic-energy community, on a joint nuclear power and research development program. Mr. McCone returned again to private life when President Eisenhower left office. But in the fall of 1961, several months after the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by American-back opponents of Fidel Castro, President John F. Kennedy called upon Mr. McCone to serve as the sixth Director of Central Intelligence. He replaced Allen W. Dulles. Although a Republican, Mr. McCone had unrestricted access to the Democratic President. Unlike Mr. Dulles, Mr. McCone emphasized the intelligence collecting and analytical aspects of the C.I.A. rather than its clandestine and covert activities. As John Ranelagh remarked in his 1987 book on the C.I.A., ""Agency: The Rise and Decline of the C.I.A.,"" Mr. McCone brought to his new job ""the skills of a manager, a keen intelligence and a strong personal self-confidence. Restored C.I.A.'s Credibility These qualities were demonstrated in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. The C.I.A. had been in disfavor at the White House since the failed invasion of Cuba in April 1961. By being first with a warning that the Soviet Union was planning to put offensive missiles in Cuba, Mr. McCone re-established the C.I.A.'s credibility, particularly with President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Mr. McCone served through the Kennedy Administration and, after the assassination of the President in November 1963, he continued under President Lyndon B. Johnson. But the rapport he had enjoyed under President Eisenhower and then with President Kennedy was missing with the new President. In his book, Mr. Ranelagh observed that President Johnson operated differently from his predecessor. While Mr, Kennedy started his day with a C.I.A. intelligence summary from Mr. McCone and appreciated when the C.I.A. director injected bits of humor, Mr. Johnson wanted an intelligence rundown at the end of the day and did not relish any asides. By the spring of 1965, Mr. Ranelagh wrote, Mr. McCone had concluded that the President did not depend heavily on intelligence provided by the agency, relying instead on his National Security Council advisers. So Mr. McCone again returned to private life. People in and out of Government have generally credited Mr. McCone with buliding an effective, well-managed agency and, in retrospect, have ranked him as one of the strongest C.I.A. directors. Views on Vietnam War On the Vietnam war, as on most other issues facing the country, Mr. McCone held strong views and expressed them forcefully. His executive assistant at the C.I.A., Walter Elder, recalled yesterday that when Mr. McCone left the Johnson Administration in 1965, he wrote the President to warn that heavy bombing would eventually turn public opinion against the United States. Although he personally thought that an all-out war would not be a good idea, he argued that because of the instability of the South Vietnamese government, such an effort might be necessary. Back in private life, Mr. McCone resumed his business activities, becoming chairman of the Hendy International Company and serving as a director of several companies, including International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. In 1973 he was called before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to testify in an inquiry into whether I.T.T. and other multinational companies had tried to bring about the downfall of the Marxist Government of Chile under Salvador Allende Gossens. Testifying about $1 million that was offered by I.T.T. to the United States for use in Chile, Mr. McCone insisted that the money was to build housing and to assist agriculture, not to bribe members of the Chilean Congress who would help bring down Mr. Allende. In 1987 Mr. McCone was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ronald Reagan. Mr. McCone's first wife, the former Rosemary Cooper, whom he married in 1938, died in 1961. He married Theiline Pigott in 1962; she died last April. He is survived by a sister, Mary Louise Shelby of El Toro, Calif., and by three stepdaughters, Ann Wyckoff, Theiline Scheumann and Mary Ellen Hughes, and two stepsons, Charles and James Pigott, all of Seattle. A private funeral service is planned."

Vaughan, who rose from the syndication sales department to lead Doubleday & Company, working with writers as diverse as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, William F. Buckley Jr., Bruce Catton and Fannie Flagg, died on Monday at his home in Tenafly, N.J.","Samuel S. Vaughan, who rose from the syndication sales department to lead Doubleday & Company, working with writers as diverse as President Dwight D. Eisenhower, William F. Buckley Jr., Bruce Catton and Fannie Flagg, died on Monday at his home in Tenafly, N.J. He was 83. The cause was complications of a stroke, his wife, Jo, said. Mr. Vaughan spent more than 30 years at Doubleday, first in sales and advertising, later in editing and acquisitions and finally in management, becoming president, publisher and editor in chief. He left the company in 1986, around the time it was sold to the German conglomerate Bertelsmann AG and ceased to be a family-owned business. He was later an editor and executive at Random House, now also part of Bertelsmann. Mr. Vaughan was known at Doubleday for a decorous manner and democratic instincts. He worked with President Eisenhower on two White House memoirs, ''Mandate for Change'' and ''White House Years: Waging Peace, 1956-1961,'' and a more personal reminiscence, ''At Ease: Stories I Tell to Friends.'' He also edited three Civil War books in the 1960s by the historian Bruce Catton: ''The Coming Fury,'' ''Terrible Swift Sword'' and ''Never Call Retreat.'' And it was Mr. Vaughan who persuaded Mr. Buckley, a friend, to try his hand at fiction, a suggestion that produced the Blackford Oakes series of spy novels. ''He had an ability to see to the heart of a book, recognize what it was really about and unearth it from under all the baggage,'' said Kate Medina, an executive vice president at Random House, whose first job in publishing, as Mr. Vaughan's Dictaphone secretary, entailed typing his letters to President Eisenhower. Mr. Vaughan edited Wallace Stegner's novel ''Crossing to Safety,'' as well as the popular novels ''Wheels'' and ''The Moneychangers'' by the British-Canadian writer Arthur Hailey. He also edited ''Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe,'' a 1987 book by Ms. Flagg that centered on the tales of an older Southern woman named Ninny Threadgoode. It was made into the popular 1991 movie ''Fried Green Tomatoes,'' with Jessica Tandy as Ninny. Authors knew Mr. Vaughan as a reader of writers; that is, he knew what each needed from him. One of them, the radio personality Jonathan Schwartz, said, ''I did a lot of writing in the California desert, and so unsure of myself was I that I'd pick up the phone at any time, without considering that it might be midnight in New York, and I'd say, 'Can I read you something? It might take a little while.' '' Mr. Schwartz, whose story collection ''Almost Home'' and novel ''Distant Stations'' were published by Mr. Vaughan at Doubleday, added: ''He always said yes. And then he would edit me over the phone, and I'd go back and apply his suggestions, and I'd see how right he was.'' Samuel Snell Vaughan was born in Philadelphia on Aug. 3, 1928. His father, Joseph, was a phone company lineman; his mother, Anna, was a secretary. He went to public schools and served in the Marines after World War II before graduating from Penn State, then known as Pennsylvania State College. He had developed his interest in publishing there, working on a humor magazine called Froth and a literary magazine called Inkling. Mr. Vaughan wrote several children's books, including ''Who Ever Heard of Kangaroo Eggs?'' (1957), ''New Shoes'' (1961) and ''The Two-Thirty Bird'' (1965). He wrote articles about the publishing business and for a decade or more taught a class at Columbia. In addition to his wife, the former Josephine LoBiondo, whom he married in 1949, Mr. Vaughan is survived by two sons, Jeffrey and David; two daughters, Leslie and Dana; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. ''He was like one of those gentleman professors,'' Ms. Flagg said of Mr. Vaughan in an interview on Tuesday. ''If it hadn't been for Sam, I don't think I would have a career. Nobody wanted to publish 'Fried Green Tomatoes,' and a lot of people turned it down. They didn't think a book about an old lady in a nursing home would be of interest to anyone, but obviously Sam did. I sent him a little bit, and when he called, he said, 'Ms. Flagg, this is Sam Vaughan, and I would be delighted to publish your book.' ''"
29667,"Mary Hudson, 86, Entrepreneur Who Built Hudson Oil Empire","Mary Hudson, who built an oil empire that made her one of America's richest entrepreneurs, died on Thursday at her home.","PRAIRIE VILLAGE, Kan., Sept. 4 Mary Hudson, who built an oil empire that made her one of America's richest entrepreneurs, died on Thursday at her home. She was 86 and lived in Prairie Village, a suburb of Kansas City. The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Joyce Driver Sharp of Prairie Village, who said she became ill in July, but was given a diagnosis of cancer only two weeks ago. In 1933, after her husband was killed in a truck accident, Ms. Hudson borrowed $200 from her father to open her first Hudson Oil station in Kansas City. It was the first of more than 300 gas stations and convenience stores that became a $325 million business. Much of her business fell apart in the 1980's after a string of court judgments entered against her company for overcharging customers at the pumps and for underpaying some employees. She pleaded no contest to conspiracy to commit felony theft in connection with the overcharges and was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. She rebounded in the final years of her career, however, to oversee a smaller, rejuvenated operation. Ms. Hudson started Hudson Oil Company at age 21, while caring for a 6-month-old daughter, and built it into a chain of stations with a reputation for low prices and no-frills service. The stations were among the first in the country to feature self-service. By the early 1980's, her private-brand refining and retail marketing companies operated more than 300 stations and convenience stores in 35 states. Hudson Oil also ran an oil refinery in Cushing, Okla. Her business interests soured in the early 1980's, when the United States petroleum industry crashed. At a time when the industry was sitting on huge reserves of oil selling for $43 a barrel, Middle East producers began flooding the market, and prices plunged to $10 a barrel. Hudson closed its Cushing refinery. ""We were losing $500,000 a month,"" Ms. Hudson recalled in a 1993 interview. ""We had no other choice."" In 1984, the company defaulted on a $20 million line of credit at United Missouri Bank and banks in Chicago and Oklahoma City. Hudson Oil and eight affiliated companies filed for reorganization in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Kansas City, Kan. Meanwhile, a corporate reorganization dragged on for six years as, piece by piece, the company's properties were sold to pay creditors. Mary Hudson lost control of the company. In 1993, at age 80, she oversaw an operation that included cattle ranches, farms, several Handy Stop convenience stores and a petroleum consulting firm in Russia. Recently, she had been selling those properties, while continuing to operate farms in Nevada. She was particularly proud of her membership in the Twenty-Five Year Club, an organization of top oil company executives. She was the only female member. ""They treat me just as nice as if I was one of them -- I am one of them -- and if you checked it out, I'm probably worth more than a lot of them,"" she said of her fellow club members in a 1995 interview. http://www.nytimes.com"
27982,"Augusto Pablo, 46, Musician; Helped Shape Reggae's Sound","Augustus Pablo, a widely influential reggae producer, died on Tuesday at University Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica.","Augustus Pablo, a widely influential reggae producer, died on Tuesday at University Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. He was 46 and lived in the hills outside Kingston. The cause was myasthenia gravis, a nerve disorder, said his brother, Garth Swaby. Mr. Pablo, whose original name was Horace Swaby, was known for what he called the ""Far East sound"": haunting, minor-key tunes with sparse lines for melodica (a harmonica with a keyboard) floating above deep bass lines and echoing keyboards. He was an architect of dub reggae, music in which deep bass lines and dizzying echo effects envelop a few shards of melody. Born in Kingston in 1953, he became a Rastafarian while still a teen-ager; he also taught himself to play piano. Bob Marley brought him into the studio to play keyboards on early Wailers recordings, and he began working regularly as a session musician in the late 1960's. He joined the house band at Randy's Studio, a leading Kingston studio. A friend introduced him to the melodica, and he took it into the studio when he had his first recording sessions as a leader in 1969 with the producer Herman Chin-Loy. His first single, ""Iggy Iggy,"" was credited to Augustus Pablo, a name Mr. Chin-Loy used for instrumentals. When Mr. Adams moved to the United States in 1971, he left the Pablo name to Mr. Swaby. With his next single, ""East of the River Nile,"" Mr. Swaby as Augustus Pablo inaugurated the Far East sound, and he followed it with his first major Jamaican hit, ""Java,"" in 1972. While making solo recordings, often reworkings of past and present hits, he was also in demand as a studio musician, and he worked for a dozen leading Jamaican producers in the early 70's. In 1972 he started running his own labels, including Hot Stuff, Rockers International, Yard and Message. Mr. Pablo produced recordings for singers, notably Junior Delgado, Jacob Miller and Hugh Mundell, and he released instrumentals under his own name. Those instrumentals are cornerstones of modern dub reggae, particularly those he recorded in the mid-70's, including the albums ""King Tubby Meets Rockers Uptown"" (a 1976 album of Pablo instrumentals remixed by the engineer and producer King Tubby) and ""East of the River Nile"" from 1978. Mr. Pablo rarely toured; his milieu was the recording studio. He had hits in Jamaica as Junior Delgado's producer in the mid-80's, and he continued releasing his own instrumental recordings well into 90's, adding digital technology to his older style. In addition to his brother, he is survived by his companion, Karen Scott; a son, Addis; a daughter, Isis; a sister, Claudia Swaby McBean, and his mother, Buelah Swaby. http://www.nytimes.com"
453,"Hector Babenco, 'Spider Woman' Director, Dies at 70","Hector Babenco, the Argentine-born Brazilian director whose low-budget 1985 film, ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' became an unlikely hit that challenged conventions of masculinity and stunned the Hollywood establishment, died on Wednesday in So Paulo.","Hector Babenco, the Argentine-born Brazilian director whose low-budget 1985 film, ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' became an unlikely hit that challenged conventions of masculinity and stunned the Hollywood establishment, died on Wednesday in So Paulo. He was 70. His death was confirmed by Denise Winther, an employee of his film company, who told The Associated Press that he had a heart attack. With ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' an adaptation of Manuel Puig's 1976 novel of the same name, Mr. Babenco established himself as a filmmaker unafraid to push the boundaries of what Hollywood's old guard deemed appropriate or bankable. The setting for the film, which cost $1.8 million, was an Argentine jail cell shared by two men. Molina, played by William Hurt, is a gay man jailed for soliciting minors; Valentin, played by Raul Julia, is a political prisoner. The film, set during Argentina's so-called dirty war of the 1970s, traces the evolution of a relationship between cellmates who at first seem ideologically incompatible. ''These two people, in their confined environment, simply have to talk all the time,'' Mr. Babenco said in an interview with The New York Times in 1984. ''My task was to make it fresh and open, dynamic.'' He was successful. The film, made in an era when gay characters were rare onscreen, earned critical accolades for the actors, who agreed to forgo their salaries in exchange for a share of the film's profits. Mr. Hurt won the Oscar for best actor, and Mr. Babenco was nominated for best director. ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' was later a Tony Award-winning Broadway musical, with music by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Terrence McNally. Mr. Babenco went on to direct the film adaptation of ''Ironweed,'' William Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel set during the Depression. The movie, starring Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, was released in 1987. Though those films established Mr. Babenco in Hollywood, he did not stray far from his roots. Many of his later films, like ''Foolish Heart'' (1998) and ''Carandiru'' (2003), hinted at his own passions or had personal meaning to him. ''Pixote'' (1981), his best-known film before ''Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' depicted the grim lives of boys growing up on the streets of So Paulo and was told through the eyes of a boy who encounters rape, blackmail and murder. Hector Babenco was born on Feb. 7, 1946, in Mar del Plata, Argentina. He grew up a timid boy who loved the movies, watching up to 10 a week. He told The Times in 1981 that he left home shortly after he turned 18 when his father, with whom he had a tumultuous relationship, expressed hostility to his interest in the arts. Moving to Spain, he found work as a film extra, married, had a daughter and divorced. Mr. Babenco sensed that there would be more opportunity for filmmaking in South America, so in the early 1970s he settled in Brazil, where he became a citizen. His survivors include his wife, the Brazilian actress Barbara Paz, and a daughter, Janka. The first of his films to attract wide notice was ''Pixote,'' which was rooted in true stories and featured a young cast plucked from the streets. (Fernando Ramos, who played the title role, was fatally shot by the police in 1996.) ''A lot of the details are tough to take,'' Vincent Canby of The Times wrote in his review, ''but it is neither exploitative nor pretentious. Mr. Babenco shows us rock-bottom, and because he is an artist, he makes us believe it as well all of the possibilities that have been lost.'' The film was nominated for a Golden Globe and received awards from critics associations in New York and Los Angeles. Mr. Babenco said in an interview with The Times that he hoped ''Pixote'' could bring back innocence to young people hardened by street life. But, he said, he also wanted to show viewers ''how you destroy the innocence of a 10-year-old child.'' Mr. Babenco took a break from filming for much of the 1990s to undergo treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He had received chemotherapy as far back as 1986, when he was working on ''Ironweed.'' His first major project after resurfacing in 2002 was a movie based on ''Carandiru,'' a best-selling Brazilian novel about the filthy conditions at the largest prison in Latin America. The book was written by Dr. Druzio Varella, who had helped treat Mr. Babenco's cancer. ''He was my guide in the jungle,'' Mr. Babenco said in 2002 of Dr. Druzio's work to treat his illness. ''So I am trying to pay him back by making a movie even more beautiful than his book.''"
19494,"Steve Kordek, a Pinball Innovator, Dies at 100","Steve Kordek, who revolutionized the game of pinball in the 1940s by designing what became the standard two-flipper machine found in bars and penny arcades around the world, died on Sunday at a hospice in Park Ridge, Ill.","Steve Kordek, who revolutionized the game of pinball in the 1940s by designing what became the standard two-flipper machine found in bars and penny arcades around the world, died on Sunday at a hospice in Park Ridge, Ill. He was 100. His daughter Catherine Petrash confirmed his death. Mr. Kordek actually revised a revision of what until the 1930s had been called the pin game. In that version a player would pull a plunger to release the ball, then shake the table in an often frustrating attempt to redirect the ball toward a scoring target -- a cup or a hole. In 1947, two designers at the D. Gottlieb & Company pinball factory in Chicago, Harry Mabs and Wayne Neyens, transformed that rudimentary game into one called Humpty Dumpty, adding six electromechanical flippers, three on each side from the top to the bottom of the field. It was an instant hit -- until, at a trade show in Chicago 1948, Mr. Kordek introduced Triple Action, a game that featured just two flippers, both controlled by buttons at the bottom of the table. Mr. Kordek was a designer for Genco, one of more than two dozen pinball manufacturers in Chicago at the time. Not only was Mr. Kordek's two-flipper game less expensive to produce; it also gave players greater control. For someone concentrating on keeping a chrome-plated ball from dropping into the ''drain,'' two flippers, one for each hand, were better than six. ''It really was revolutionary, and pretty much everyone else followed suit,'' David Silverman, executive director of the National Pinball Museum in Baltimore, said in an interview. ''And it's stayed the standard for 60 years.'' Roger Sharpe, author of ''Pinball!'' (1977), a history of the industry, agreed. ''But not only did Steve choose to put two flippers down at the bottom of the playfield,'' Mr. Sharpe said, ''even more importantly he provided direct-current power to those flippers, meaning that a ball skillfully flipped from the bottom of the playfield could actually get to the top, and anywhere in between, with some semblance of accuracy.'' Previous games had mostly used less powerful alternating current. Mr. Kordek's career spanned more than six decades and the industry's evolution from battery power to computers. While the two-flipper standard is perhaps his most significant contribution, he would go on to lead design teams that created more than 100 games -- at Genco and later for Bally Manufacturing and Williams Manufacturing -- many of which were hits. Among them are Space Mission, which was inspired by the Apollo and Soyuz satellite missions; Grand Prix, with a car-racing theme; Contact, in which humans and space aliens meet; and Pokerino, based on poker. The last game to which Mr. Kordek contributed was Vacation America, a computerized game released in 2003 that was inspired by the National Lampoon ''Vacation'' movies. ''Steve's impact would be comparable to D. W. Griffith moving from silent films through talkies and color and CinemaScope and 3-D with computer-generated graphics,'' Mr. Sharpe said. ''He moved through each era seamlessly.'' Steven Francis Kordek was born in Chicago on Dec. 26, 1911, the oldest of 10 children of Anna and Frank Kordek. His father worked in the steel mills. Steven Kordek worked in the Civilian Conservation Corps and for the United States Forest Service during the Depression. On a visit to his hometown in 1937, he was walking down a street without an umbrella when a torrential rain forced him to step into the lobby of a building he was passing. It was the Genco company. A receptionist asked if he was looking for a job. ''I had never seen a pin game before in my life,'' Mr. Kordek told The Chicago Tribune in 2009. For 45 cents an hour, he was soon doing soldering on the company's production line. He studied at the Coyne Electric School at night and began working his way up through the Genco engineering department. Mr. Kordek married Harriet Pieniazek in 1941; she died in 2003. Besides his daughter Catherine, he is survived by another daughter, Donna Kordek-Logazino; two sons, Frank and Richard; a sister, Florence Wozny; two brothers, Joseph and Frank; six grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. Several pinball machines line the walls of Mr. Kordek's house, his daughter Catherine said. ''It's always been the activity center for all our children and their friends.'' Mr. Kordek never got tired of the clang, clack and buzz of pinball. ''I had more fun in this business than anyone could believe,'' he told The Tribune."

He was 76. Mr. Einstein died of cancer and had Parkinson's disease, according to his son Gilles. Mr. Einstein and his twin brother, Ted, were born on Aug. 22, 1923, in Frankfurt, Germany, the children of Julius Einstein, a carpet merchant, and his wife, Rita. As refugees from the Nazi regime, they settled in France with their parents before World War II. After the Nazis invaded France, the family became separated and the boys, by then teen-agers, worked on farms in the south of France. Ted Einstein came to the United States in 1947 at the age of 24 and established a carpet business; he was joined by Ernst in 1955. Later that year, the Einstein brothers, along with Albert and Walter Moomjy, also brothers, formed a company that became known as Einstein Moomjy, the Carpet Department Store. Today, the chain has four stores in New Jersey and one in Manhattan. Mr. Einstein is survived by his wife, the former Charlene Ollier, two daughters, Rita Davis of Bryn Mawr, Pa., and Jessica Kaufman of Easton, Conn.; two sons, Gilles, of Greenville, S.C., and Jean Einstein of Westwood, N.J.; and 10 grandchildren. http://www.nytimes.com"

He was 95. Mr. Steiner was born in Baltimore and was raised in Cincinnati. He obtained a bachelor's degree in economics at Harvard. After a brief stint in the office of budget at the State Department, Mr. Steiner returned to Cincinnati in the early 1940's to work in a business with his brothers. In 1946, Mr. Steiner, with his brothers, Philip and Albert, and a nephew, Robert, founded Kenner Products in Cincinnati as a soap, flavoring and extract business. The founders' research into bubbles led to their first toy, the Bubble Matic, a gun that shoots streams of soap bubbles. The toy led to the development of the Bubble Rocket, which sold over a million units in the company's second year. ""Homegrown talent and homegrown ideas accounted for much of the company's success,"" a nephew, Corky Steiner, said. Joseph Steiner took charge of the company's sales and marketing. He had traveled extensively throughout the country, promoting and selling Kenner toys. He also made trips to Europe, where he sought to license European products as well as to license Kenner's products to European toy manufacturers. During a trip to England, Mr. Steiner met Denys Fischer, who invented a toy that used circular templates and color pens to create intricate designs. Mr. Steiner talked his brothers and nephew into licensing the Spirograph and the company introduced it in 1967. The toy became one of the best sellers in Kenner's history. Throughout the 1960's, Kenner created toy versions of adult activities like the Easy-Bake Oven and the Close'n Play phonograph. The company was acquired by General Mills in 1967. Mr. Steiner and his two brothers retired in 1971 by agreement with General Mills. Robert Steiner remained with the company as president, retiring a year later. Kenner was a division of General Mills until it was spun off in 1985. Mr. Steiner is survived by a son, John Albert Steiner of Boulder, Colo.; two grandchildren, Elizabeth and Michael; and three nephews, Corky Steiner of Cincinnati, Robert L. Steiner of Washington, and Rick Steiner of Cincinnati."

Beard, former president and chief executive officer of Braniff International Airways, died of a heart ailment Sunday at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.","Charles E. Beard, former president and chief executive officer of Braniff International Airways, died of a heart ailment Sunday at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. He was 81 years old and lived in Dallas. Mr. Beard, who joined Braniff as a general traffic manager in Oklahoma City in 1935, was head of the airline from 1954 to 1965, directing its growth from a small regional airline based in Dallas to one of the nation's 10 largest carriers. After 1965, when Mr. Beard retired, Braniff continued to expand, but as a result of debt, declining passenger loads and rising fuel costs in the late 1970's, it suspended operations last May and filed for protection under Federal bankruptcy laws. Landmarks in Career Mr. Beard rose quickly through the ranks at Braniff. He became a vice president in 1937, a member of the board of directors in 1943 and executive vice president in 1947. In that post, he was credited with much of the airline's aggressive expansion, including its first flights to Latin America in late 1940's. After the death of Thomas E. Braniff, the company's founder, in a private plane crash, Mr. Beard was named president in January 1954. He was succeeded in February 1965 by Harding L. Lawrence, who was then executive vice president of Continental Air Lines. Mr. Beard was a member of the Air Transport Association's national advertising committee and a member of the air transport committee of the United States Council of the International Chamber of Commerce. He was also a national director of the National Conference of Christians and Jews and a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Educated in Illinois and Ohio Charles Edmund Beard was born in Toledo, Ohio. He attended Lake Forest Academy and Lake Forest College in Illinois and then, after serving in the Navy during World War I, was graduated from the University of Toledo, with a degree in journalism. His association with the airline business began in 1929, when he was named secretary and manager of the newly organized Chicago Air Traffic Association, where he was in charge of the world's first consolidated air ticket office. He joined Northwest Airlines in St. Paul in 1933, and moved to Braniff two years later. Mr. Beard is survived by his wife, Doris Stewart Beard; a son, the Rev. Robert D.

He was 83. He became Archbishop of Barcelona in December 1971 and was elevated to Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in February 1973. In the waning years of Franco's right-wing dictatorship, Cardinal Jubany rarely took part in political acts at a time when it was still common for military, civilian and religious leaders to appear together in solidarity with Franco. In a noted case after Franco's death in 1975, Cardinal Jubany did not seek to excommunicate a priest who joined the Communist Party and won election as mayor of an industrial suburb of Barcelona. He simply asked the priest to give up his post as spiritual leader of his parish. Born Aug. 12, 1913, to a working-class family in the town of Santa Coloma de Farnes, Mr. Jubany moved to Barcelona at age 13 and undertook religious studies. He earned a doctorate in canon law from Gregorian University in Rome. He worked as a young priest in Barcelona, becoming an auxiliary bishop in Barcelona in 1956 and then Bishop of Gerona in 1964.

He was 52 and lived in Chicago. His family said he died of a form of lymphoma that resulted from his exposure to the chemical defoliant Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Mr. Mier's wife, Joan Fitzgerald, said her husband had applied for disability connected with his exposure and had received a letter granting his claim two days before he died. Mr. Mier was the architect and chief proponent of Chicago's highly regarded 1984 development plan, which he created as the city's director of economic development. Known as Chicago Works Together, the plan became a national model for other large cities struggling to retain their industrial and economic base while making neighborhoods easier to live in. Some of his major accomplishments included a new $175 million public library, an export program for small businesses and a community-based general delivery system. Over all, he led efforts to keep factories open and to help neighborhoods control their own economic development. At the University of Chicago, he founded the Center for Urban Economic Development in 1978. During its 17 years, the center has helped communities help themselves with technical assistance and research. Mr. Mier also served as a consultant to cities here and abroad. In the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, he was asked by the American Planning Association to conduct seminars for planning directors in Southern California. Born in St. Louis, he graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a degree in civil engineering in 1965. He received a doctorate in city and regional planning at Cornell University in 1974. He served as a Navy lieutenant in Vietnam, but later resigned his commission because of opposition to the war.

Mann, a career diplomat and an architect of a switch to an American policy in Latin America in the 1960's that emphasized free enterprise, died last Saturday at his home in Austin, Tex.","WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 Thomas C. Mann, a career diplomat and an architect of a switch to an American policy in Latin America in the 1960's that emphasized free enterprise, died last Saturday at his home in Austin, Tex. He was 87. Mr. Mann's appointment by President Johnson to a high State Department post shortly after the death of President Kennedy was seen as a signal to Kennedy loyalists that the new Administration was going to switch to policies in Latin America that focused on the interests of American and local businesses. Former policies had emphasized the promotion of democracy. On Dec. 14, 1963, just three weeks after Kennedy's assassination, Johnson named Mr. Mann as Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Johnson's first major appointment. Four days later Johnson named Mr. Mann to the additional post of special assistant to the President. The historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a Kennedy adherent, praised Mr. Mann for one aspect of his Latin American policy, his opposition to the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, recalling that ""he thought it was nonsense."" But Mr. Schlesinger faulted him for the way he carried out Johnson's policies in Latin America. Under Johnson and Mr. Mann, Mr. Schlesinger wrote in ""Robert Kennedy and His Times,"" many of the political and social components of the Alliance for Progress, a program aimed at helping Latin American countries attain democracy and improve living conditions, were removed. Much of what remained, he wrote, was converted ""into an instrumentality for North American corporations."" Robert M. Sayre, who served on the National Security Council and was Ambassador to Uruguay, Panama and Brazil, defended his friend and colleague against some of Mr. Schlesinger's statements. ""I don't think he was Tex-Mex,"" Mr. Sayre said, explaining that the term was once used in the Government to describe those who had a low opinion of Latin American capabilities. He pointed to Mr. Mann's bilingual upbringing along the United States-Mexican border at Laredo and his experience as Ambassador to Mexico and El Salvador as evidence of his affection for the area. Prof. Walter LaFeber, a Cornell University historian, wrote that Mr. Mann's career ""is a case study of how the United States moved from Good Neighbor to the overt use of military power in the hemisphere."" ""Mann was by no means primarily responsible for the devolution,"" Mr. LaFeber wrote, but said it illustrated the way a Washington policy shift originated and developed. Mr. Mann played important foreign policy roles involving many countries. In 1964 he arranged help for Eduardo Frei Montalva, a moderate, in defeating Salvador Allende Gossens, a Socialist, to become President of Chile. Mr. Allende won the next election, in 1970, and died in a Washington-backed coup that overthrew his Government in 1973. Also in 1964, Professor LaFeber wrote, Mr. Mann supported military officers after they overthrew the President of Brazil, Joao Goulart, whom he viewed as ""an inept President, easily influenced by leftist advisers and cronies."" In 1965, Johnson, at Mr. Mann's urging, sent 22,800 troops to the Dominican Republic to put down what Washington regarded as a Communist threat. That action led to opposition in Congress and Mr. Mann's replacement in the inter-American post in 1966. By then, Mr. LaFeber wrote, ""Thomas Mann's policies were the future of U.S. policies in Latin America."" Mr. Mann once said in an interview that he had learned Spanish before English. In high school he stood out as a scholar and quarterback, taking Laredo to an undefeated season in 1927. Mr. Mann's son, the Rev. Clifton A. Mann, said his father graduated from Baylor University in 1934 with a bachelor's and a law degree and practiced law in Texas until the United States entered World War II. ""After Pearl Harbor he went to take his physical and flunked it because of his eyes, and was despondent,"" Father Mann said. At that point Mr. Mann saw an advertisement recruiting Spanish-speaking lawyers and wound up working for the Office of Economic Warfare, posted in Uruguay. Professor LaFeber said one of Mr. Mann's jobs had been to monitor Nazi shipping in the South Atlantic. At the close of the war, Mr. Mann transferred to the Foreign Service, where he spent the rest of his government career, retiring in 1966. He was president of the Automobile Manufacturers Association from 1967 to 1971. Mr. Mann's wife of 64 years, Nancy, died in 1997. He is survived by his son, Father Mann, an Episcopal priest in Lubbock, Tex.; six granddaughters, and three great-granddaughters. ""My dad was Lyndon Johnson's first appointment, and that caused him a lot of pain,"" Father Mann said.

He was 88. Mr. Adams, who in addition to his years of stand-up comedy also wrote joke books and made films, had a syndicated joke column in The New York Post, ""Strictly for Laughs,"" for at least 20 years, said Marcee Layne, his longtime personal assistant. His second wife, Cindy Heller, whom he married in 1952, became that newspaper's celebrity gossip columnist, Cindy Adams. Mr. Adams once said, ""One condition of the marriage was that I get custody of all her material."" One of Mr. Adams's best-known jokes came from the 80th birthday party that Ms. Adams threw for him in 1991 at the New York Helmsley Hotel. The guest list included Leona Helmsley, who was later convicted of tax evasion; Bess Myerson, the New York City cultural affairs commissioner, who was once engulfed in an influence-peddling scandal; and Imelda Marcos, who sang ""Happy Birthday"" to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams remarked then, in a line that was widely reported, ""If you're indicted, you're invited."" The son of a Brooklyn tailor, Mr. Adams was born Joe Abromowitz on Jan. 6, 1911, changing his name in 1930. He attended City College, but he frequently cut class to make vaudeville appearances. Some three months shy of graduation in 1931, he left permanently. Twenty years later, he was given an honorary ""Doctor of Comedy"" degree by the college. As a budding comedian, he first supported himself by selling hats at Namm's department store. While performing in the Catskills, he also took dishwashing and bookkeeping jobs. His first real break came in 1941, when he performed at Leon & Eddie's nightclub on 52nd Street. He began taking movie roles in 1945 and appeared in films including ""Ringside"" and ""Singing in the Dark,"" in which he essentially played himself -- a nightclub comedian.

11048,"Mary Rodgers, 83, Author and Composer","Mary Rodgers, who wrote songs and children's books and, by virtue of genetics and serendipity as well as talent, lived at the red-hot center of American musical theater, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan.","Mary Rodgers, who wrote songs and children's books and, by virtue of genetics and serendipity as well as talent, lived at the red-hot center of American musical theater, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83. The cause was heart failure, her son Alexander Guettel said. Ms. Rodgers, the daughter of the composer Richard Rodgers, is probably best known for writing the music for ''Once Upon a Mattress,'' the fairy-tale farce about a love-hungry princess that made Carol Burnett a star in 1959; and for writing ''Freaky Friday,'' a novel for young people about a teenage girl who switches bodies with her mother. Well reviewed when it was published in 1972, ''Freaky Friday'' has had several lives on the screen, including a 1976 film version starring Barbara Harris and a teenage Jodie Foster -- Ms. Rodgers wrote the screenplay -- and a 2003 movie starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. In perhaps any other family Ms. Rodgers would have been the star. But along with a series of men in her life, she belonged to the Windsors of the musical theater. With Lorenz Hart or Oscar Hammerstein II as lyricist, her father created a cache of Broadway's signature shows, among them ''Pal Joey,'' ''Oklahoma!,'' ''The King and I,'' ''Carousel'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' Her son Adam Guettel is the Tony Award-winning composer and lyricist of musicals like ''Floyd Collins'' and ''The Light in the Piazza.'' Together with her great friend Stephen Sondheim, they describe a straight line through nearly the entire history of American songwriting for the stage. Ms. Rodgers was born in Manhattan on Jan. 11, 1931. Much of her family life was a secret until 2001, when a television documentary and a biography of her father revealed the dark side of the man who wrote the music for ''You'll Never Walk Alone,'' ''My Favorite Things,'' ''June Is Bustin' Out All Over'' and many more of the sunniest songs ever written for the stage. An alcoholic and a serial philanderer tormented by phobias, Richard Rodgers was portrayed as a genius who put everything into his work with little left over for his wife, the former Dorothy Feiner, and his children. ''There is a home movie of Daddy with me when I was 10 months old or so out in Hollywood,'' Ms. Rodgers said in an interview with Frank Rich of The New York Times in 2001. ''There's a really handsome, loving, funny guy lying in a pair of swimming trunks on the grass playing with this baby, with a kind of good-natured, silly joy that I had never seen in my life because I was too young to remember that. And I looked at it and thought, God, where did that man go and why did I never see him? That charming-looking handsome kid turned into a wizened, sad, deer-in-the-headlights person.'' Ms. Rodgers grew up playing piano -- ''moderately well,'' she said. She graduated from the Brearley School and went to Wellesley College, where she studied music, though not composition. Years later, she recalled that at Wellesley they didn't even teach composition. ''They obviously didn't think women should or could write music,'' she told The Juilliard Journal in 2012. She was chairwoman of the Juilliard School board from 1994 to 2001. She left Wellesley before graduating to marry, but while at school she wrote her first songs. A dozen were published in 1952 under the title ''Some of My Best Friends Are Children.'' Ms. Rodgers befriended Mr. Sondheim when they were teenagers -- they both spent a summer at the Westport Country Playhouse in Connecticut -- and she told his biographer Meryle Secrest that she had spent some time in love with him. The character of Mary in Mr. Sondheim's musical ''Merrily We Roll Along'' is sometimes presumed to have been drawn from their friendship, though Ms. Rodgers and her namesake in the show were not terribly alike. Still, Mr. Sondheim has said that the only autobiographical song he ever wrote was ''Opening Doors'' from ''Merrily''; it depicts young people trying to get established in show business and publishing and is based, he said, on himself, Ms. Rodgers and the director Hal Prince, among others. In 1957, Ms. Rodgers went with Mr. Sondheim to Washington, where ''West Side Story,'' for which he had written the lyrics, was opening. At a dinner she met the show's composer, Leonard Bernstein, who hired her to help write and produce the television shows of Bernstein's New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts, a job she held for more than a decade. Besides ''Once Upon a Mattress,'' which was directed on Broadway by George Abbott, Ms. Rodgers wrote the music for several other shows, including ''Hot Spot'' (1963), a short-lived Broadway political satire that starred Judy Holliday as a Peace Corps volunteer in a mythical country; and a popular Off Broadway revue, ''The Mad Show'' (1966), a collection of skits adapted from Mad magazine. She wrote a musical for television, ''Feathertop,'' based loosely on a Nathaniel Hawthorne short story, and scores for productions by the Bil Baird marionettes. A revival of ''Once Upon a Mattress'' with Sarah Jessica Parker was nominated for a Tony in 1997. Ms. Rodgers's children's books included ''A Billion for Boris,'' about a boy whose television set broadcasts tomorrow's shows today (he uses this to his advantage by betting on racehorses); ''The Rotten Book,'' about a child who has a fine imagination for what constitutes rotten behavior; and ''Summer Switch,'' a sequel to ''Freaky Friday'' involving a father and son. Ms. Rodgers's first marriage, to Julian Beaty Jr., a lawyer known as Jerry, ended in divorce. Her second, to Henry Guettel (rhymes with ''metal''), a former executive director of the Theater Development Fund, ended with his death last fall. In addition to her sons Alexander, who is known as Alec, and Adam, she is survived by another son, Richard Rodgers Beaty, known as Tod; two daughters, Constance Peck Beaty, known as Kim, and Nina Beaty; a sister, Linda Rodgers Emory; five grandchildren; and two step-grandchildren. ''The Light in the Piazza,'' Adam Guettel's 2005 musical, for which he won a Tony for best score, was based on a 1950s novel by Elizabeth Spencer about an American woman traveling in Italy with her mentally disabled daughter, who falls in love with an Italian man. Years ago, Ms. Rodgers had suggested the story to her father as ripe for musicalizing, but he decided against it. Decades later she passed the idea on to her son. Why, she was asked in 2003, did she not adapt the work herself? ''I had a pleasant talent but not an incredible talent,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times Magazine. ''I was not my father or my son. And you have to abandon all kinds of things.''"

Scott, who was part of the team at Columbia Records that introduced the long-playing vinyl record in 1948 before going on to produce albums with the New York Philharmonic, Glenn Gould, Isaac Stern and many other giants of classical music, died on Sept. 22 in Reading, Pa.","Howard H. Scott, who was part of the team at Columbia Records that introduced the long-playing vinyl record in 1948 before going on to produce albums with the New York Philharmonic, Glenn Gould, Isaac Stern and many other giants of classical music, died on Sept. 22 in Reading, Pa. He was 92. The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Andrea K. Scott. In 1946, Mr. Scott was 26 and just discharged from the Army when he got a job at Columbia Masterworks, the label's classical division. He was soon assigned to Columbia's top-secret project: developing a long-playing record to replace the 78 r.p.m. disc, which could hold only about four minutes of music on each brittle shellac side. The project had begun in 1940 and was nearing completion. But its engineers needed someone with musical training -- particularly the ability to read orchestral scores -- to help transfer recordings from 78s to the new discs, which played at 331/3 r.p.m., could hold about 22 minutes a side and were made of more durable vinyl. Howard Hillison Scott fit the bill. Born in Bridgeport, Conn., on May 31, 1920, he graduated from the Eastman School of Music in 1941 and had just begun graduate piano studies at Juilliard when he was drafted the next year. Back in civilian life in July 1946, he was hired by Columbia as a trainee. In the days before magnetic tape came into wide use, the process of transferring music to the new discs (soon to be known as LPs) was complex. Long pieces of music, split among multiple records, needed to be stitched together on the new discs without interruption. To do that, Mr. Scott and his colleagues turned to Columbia's original recordings on large lacquer discs, which were recorded at 33 1/3 and sometimes had multiple or incomplete takes, said Marc C. Kirkeby, a music archivist who has worked closely with the lacquers. They lined up overlapping segments of music, and -- with Mr. Scott snapping his finger in coordination -- switched the audio signal from one lacquer to another, seamlessly joining the segments on the resulting LP. As the industry began to use magnetic tape, beginning in the late 1940s, such work was no longer necessary. As a staff producer at Columbia, Mr. Scott worked on hundreds of recordings by most of the major orchestras of the United States, including those of Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Cincinnati in addition to the New York Philharmonic. He had a particularly close association with Gould, beginning with his historic recording of Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations in 1955. Mr. Scott left Columbia in 1961 and worked at MGM Records, RCA Red Seal, the publisher G. Schirmer and the Rochester Philharmonic, where he was executive manager in the 1970s. He won a 1966 Grammy Award as the producer of the classical album of the year: Charles Ives's Symphony No. 1, performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Morton Gould conducting, on RCA Red Seal. From 1986 until his retirement in 1993, Mr. Scott worked for Sony, Columbia's corporate successor, as a producer, once again transferring old albums to a new format: the CD. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Scott is survived by a son, Jon; two sisters, Carol Ruth Shepherd and Elaine Silver; and two granddaughters. In a 1998 interview with The New York Times, on the 50th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, Mr. Scott remarked about the durability of the format, and took note of a small renaissance taking root at the time.

He was 43 years old and lived in Manhattan. Mr. Smalls studied music at the Henry Street Settlement and was a 1961 graduate of the Juilliard School. In the years that followed, he was a pianist with the New York Jazz Repertory Company and toured with Harry Belafonte and Hugh Masekela, among others. Mr. Smalls came to prominence in January 1975, when ''The Wiz'' - a musical version of L. Frank Baum's ''Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' with a black cast -opened at the Majestic Theater. The show was a popular success and, in 1978, was made into a film starring Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. ''The music in 'The Wiz' probably reaches deeper into black consciousness than has been generally recognized,'' Bryant Rollins wrote in The New York Times in December 1975. ''The score by Charlie Smalls intersperses songs of fantasy and humor with songs of protest. Innovation in black music follows a tradition of protest against oppression.'' Mr. Smalls was performing and working on a new musical at the time of his death, according to his lawyer, Michael Remer. Mr. Smalls is survived by a son, Michael, of Manhattan."

He was 63 and lived in Lymm, Cheshire. The cause was respiratory failure brought on by pneumonia, said Wes Adams, his editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Mr. Westall published his first novel, ""The Machine-Gunners,"" in 1975. The book, based on his childhood experiences, is the story of five British teen-agers who find and hide a machine gun during World War II. Although some critics attacked the book as unsuitable for children because of its harsh depiction of life during the blitz and its characters' penchant for swearing, it won the Carnegie Medal, Britain's most prestigious children's-book award. A string of books for young readers followed, marked by a realistic approach to violence, sexuality and family conflict. They included ""The Wind Eye"" (1976), ""The Watch House"" (1977), ""The Devil on the Road"" (1978) and ""Fathom Five"" (1979), a sequel to ""The Machine-Gunners."" ""Scarecrows"" (1980), about a young boy's turmoil over his mother's remarriage, also won the Carnegie Medal. Taught Art for 25 Years Mr. Westall was born in Tynemouth, Northumberland, and received a bachelor's degree in fine art from Durham University in 1953. From 1953 to 1955 he served in the Royal Signals, a branch of the British Army. After earning a doctorate in fine arts from the Slade School at the University of London in 1957, he spent the next 25 years as an art teacher, art-department head and careers counselor at Sir John Deane's College, a secondary school in Northwich. He also wrote for Cheshire Life and The Cheshire Chronicle, and in 1970 and 1980 he was an art critic for The Guardian. In 1985, Mr. Westall left teaching to become an antiques dealer, an occupation he gave up after a few years to write full time. Throughout his career, he returned often to his experiences in wartime Britain, most recently in ""Blitzcat"" (1989) and ""The Kingdom by the Sea"" (1990). But he also devoted many works to the supernatural, including the novels ""Stormsearch"" (1990) and ""Yaxley's Cat"" (1991). He wrote one book for adults, ""Antique Dust"" (1989), a collection of ghost stories, and edited a book of photographs, ""Children of the Blitz: Memories of Wartime Childhood"" (1985). ""Demons and Shadows,"" the first volume of a two-volume collection of the best of Mr. Westall's ghost stories, will be published in October by Farrar, Straus & Giroux."

Mr. Cotsidas, a Greek immigrant, started Table Talk in 1924, with Theodore Tonna and Wilfred A. Casavant. Initially, the company sold pastries to restaurants and hotels, but it expanded into the retail trade during the 1930's. Table Talk introduced its junior pies, which were 4 inches in diameter, in the 1950's. The company grew from a local bakery based in Worcester, Mass., to an East Coast producer and distributor of more than a million cherry, blueberry, apple and other kinds of pies each week. At its peak, Table Talk employed 400 bakers out of 800 employees, and was responsible for transforming most of the annual blueberry crop of Prince Edward Island, Canada -- four million pounds -- into pies. Mr. Cotsidas retired in 1968. Table Talk was purchased in 1965 by Beech-Nut and was sold several times before it closed in 1984. Table Talk was revived two years later by Christos Cocaine, who left the company in 1979.

He was 91. His death was announced by Leo Abse & Cohen, the Welsh law firm he founded. The cause was not announced. Mr. Abse was a Labor Party member of Parliament from 1958 to 1987. He sponsored legislation in 1967 that decriminalized private sexual acts between adult men in England and Wales. He also was involved in passing the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act of 1984, which updated divorce laws, and the Children's Act of 1975, which changed laws on adoption and caring for foster children. Noted for his dandyish apparel, Mr. Abse also won attention by writing books that tried to apply psychoanalysis to Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. ''Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love,'' published in 2000, set forth his views on Mr. Clinton's fling with Monica Lewinsky and dealt with Mr. Blair's political alliance with Gordon Brown, his successor as prime minister. Mr. Abse also wrote ''Margaret, Daughter of Beatrice,'' in 1989, ''Wotan, My Enemy: Can Britain Live With the Germans in the European Union?'' in 1995 and ''The Man Behind the Smile: Tony Blair and the Politics of Perversion,'' in 1997. In an interview this year with the magazine Intelligent Life, Mr. Abse said: ''I had two great advantages: I was born a Jew in Wales in the benign climate of Welsh nonconformity; we believed we had a covenant with God and God would look after us. ''Being in a minority within a minority, I had the benefit of being an outsider without feeling inferior. And I never went to university, which meant I wasn't groomed to conform.'' His wife of 40 years, Marjorie, died in 1996. Four years later, Mr. Abse married Ania Czeputkowska, a former shipyard worker from Gdansk, Poland, who was 51 years younger. She survives, as do a son, a daughter and his brother, the poet Dannie Abse."

He was 75. A sultanate spokesman, Abraham Idjirani, said the cause was kidney failure. Mr. Kiram was buried on Monday in an ancestral graveyard on Jolo Island in the Sulu Archipelago. Though he claimed the title of sultan of Sulu, several other descendants of the original sultan, who lived in the 15th century, make the same claim. Before Spanish colonizers arrived in the 16th century, the sultanate of Sulu ruled over vast stretches of territory, including parts of what is now the southern Philippines and Borneo. Mr. Kiram, who was born on Nov. 9, 1939, in Maimbung, the Philippines, issued a directive for the descendants of the original sultan to unite in the peaceful pursuit of the sultanate's historical claim to the part of Borneo that borders the southern Philippines, Mr. Idjirani said in a text message. Mr. Kiram's younger brother, Phugdal Kiram, was named the new sultan, he said. With the support of Mr. Kiram, the previous sultan, Jamalul Kiram III, ordered several hundred fighters to invade the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo in 2013 to reclaim the area for the sultanate and for the Philippines. The attack left more than 60 people dead, set off the most serious security crisis in Malaysia in more than a decade and strained the country's relationship with the Philippines. The sultanate's claim to parts of Borneo is based on past control over the area, and the Philippine government has said repeatedly that it continues to study the issue and has not given up on the claim. The Kirams say Sabah was leased to Malaysia. Malaysian officials contend that, in exchange for lease payments to the Kirams, the sultanate ceded the territory to their country. Over the years, the once powerful sultanate of Sulu has lost influence to other groups, becoming essentially a symbolic organization, said Richard Javad Heydarian, a political science professor at De La Salle University in Manila. ''As the botched Sabah operation showed, their political influence is very limited,'' he said. The Philippine government signed a landmark peace agreement in 2012 with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the largest Muslim separatist group in the country. The smaller Moro National Liberation Front, which is allied with some of the descendants of the sultan of Sulu, was largely left out of the peace talks. Other factions on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao have replaced the political power of the sultanate, Mr. Heydarian said. ''Mindanao has gradually moved to a postsultanate era, which is dominated by rebels, warlords and modern warfare,'' he said."

Debus, a pioneer of modern rocketry who played a pivotal role in projects ranging from the creation of Germany's V-2 rocket in World War II to the arrival of Americans on the moon, died of a heart attack yesterday in Cocoa, Fla.","Dr. Kurt H. Debus, a pioneer of modern rocketry who played a pivotal role in projects ranging from the creation of Germany's V-2 rocket in World War II to the arrival of Americans on the moon, died of a heart attack yesterday in Cocoa, Fla. He was 74 years old. Dr. Wernher von Braun, the father of modern rocketry, once said, ''We develop the rockets, and it's up to Debus to see they do what they're supposed to do.'' In the first two decades of the space age, probably no man, at least in the West, launched so many large missiles as Dr. Debus. Kurt Heinrich Debus was born in Frankfurt on Nov. 29, 1908. He went to college at Technical University in Darmstadt, where he became a member of a dueling fraternity and received a facial wound that showed as a deep scar in adulthood. He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1939. After teaching electrical theory at the university, Dr. Debus helped perform research on the V-1 and V-2 rockets at Peenem""unde in World War II. Part of von Braun's Team Dr. Debus was part of the German team led by Dr. von Braun. Starting in 1943, he was chief engineer in the V-2 program, in charge of test-firing over the Baltic. One day a V-2, fully armed with an explosive warhead, roared off course and came directly at him. Dr. Debus saw a foxhole nearby and dived in just as the missile exploded about 25 feet away. After the surrender of Nazi Germany, Dr. von Braun and his fellow scientists, including Dr. Debus, came to the United States to aid the fledgling space program. In the 1950's he worked on the Redstone Ballistic program, helping to develop the Army's first missiles with nuclear warheads and a variety of other launch vehicles. In 1952 Dr. Debus became director of operations at what was to become the Kennedy Space Center. There he directed the launch of the first American earth satellite, the first probe of the sun, and the first flight of primates. There he also oversaw the flight that made Alan B. Shepard Jr. the first American in space. Supervisor of Moon Landing Later, as astronauts orbited the moon, he said that mission was ''an old target of dreams of mankind.'' ''To go to the moon is symbolic of man's leaving earth, the opening of a vast new frontier,'' he added. He was director of the Kennedy Space Center when the first man set foot on the moon. His last official act was to break ground for the 18,000-foot landing strip at the Kennedy Space Center for the return of space shuttles from orbit. After retiring from space program in 1974 because of ill health, he lived on a beachfront in Florida within sight of the launchings at nearby Cape Canaveral. He also became involved with a West German rocket company, Otrag, which worked on low-cost rockets to launch satellites. Dr. Debus is survived by his wife, Irmgard, two daughters and two granddaughters."

He was 76 and lived at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif. The cause was complications of advanced diabetes, said his daughter Modupe Olantunji Anuku. Mr. Olatunji's 1959 album, ""Drums of Passion,"" was the first album of African drumming recorded in stereo in an American studio, and it introduced a generation to the power and intricacy of African music. While field recordings of African drumming had been available, ""Drums of Passion"" reached a mass public with its vivid sound and exotic song titles like ""Primitive Fire."" Mr. Olatunji was born and reared in Ajido, a fishing and trading village pervaded by Yoruba culture, and he made it his lifework to bring village memories to audiences everywhere. His band of drummers, singers and dancers evoked both the village's music and its masquerades, with outsize figures dancing in elaborate raffia costumes. His credo was: ""Rhythm is the soul of life. The whole universe revolves in rhythm. Everything and every human action revolves in rhythm."" In 1950 Mr. Olatunji received a scholarship to attend Morehouse College in Atlanta. He was planning to become a diplomat. He studied public administration at New York University, where he formed an African-style ensemble that eventually turned into his full-time occupation. The group performed at concerts and at civil rights rallies led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. After the group appeared with an orchestra at Radio City Music Hall, Mr. Olatunji was signed to Columbia Records. Mr. Olatunji secured foundation grants to tour schools. Among the students who were impressed by his performances -- dressed in African robes and playing hand-hewn goat-hide drums -- was Mickey Hart, who would go on to join the Grateful Dead and later recharge Mr. Olatunji's career. ""Drums of Passion"" made Mr. Olatunji the most visible African musician in the United States. Bob Dylan cited him alongside King and Willie Mays in ""I Shall Be Free"" in 1963. ""Drums of Passion"" was hugely influential among musicians, helping to spark a wave of African-jazz fusions in the early 1960's. ""Jin-Go-Lo-Ba,"" from ""Drums of Passion,"" was remade as ""Jingo"" to become the first single by Santana in 1969. Mr. Olatunji mixed African music and jazz on his albums for Columbia in the 1960's. He was a featured performer at the African Pavilion of the 1964 New York World's Fair. With support from John Coltrane, he established the Olatunji Center for African Culture in Harlem, which offered music and dance lessons to children until 1988. After his Columbia contract ended in 1965, Mr. Olatunji continued to perform, record and teach. Mr. Hart invited him to open for the Grateful Dead's New Year's Eve show in Oakland, Calif., in 1985, introducing his music to a new audience. Mr. Hart also persuaded his label, Rykodisc, to rerelease two independently recorded 1980's albums by Mr. Olatunji: ""Drums of Passion: The Beat"" (1986), which included guest appearances by the guitarist Carlos Santana, and ""Drums of Passion: The Invocation"" (1988), featuring Yoruba chants. Mr. Olatunji recorded and toured during the 1990's as a member of Mr. Hart's world-beat supergroup, Planet Drum, and made an instructional videotape, ""African Drumming,"" released in 1996. He moved to Washington and then to Big Sur, where he became an artist in residence at Esalen. Mr. Olatunji also continued to lead his own group, Drums of Passion, which included students and family members: his daughter Modupe and his seven grandchildren. He is also survived by his wife, Amy Bush Olatunji, from whom he is separated; two sons, Omotola Olatunji, of Brooklyn, and Niyi Esubiyi, of Belle Meade, N.J.; another daughter, Folasade Olatunji Olusekun of Boston; and a brother, Dr. Akinsola Akiwowo, of Alexandria, Va. Mr. Olatunji's most recent album, ""Love Drum Talk"" (Chesky) was released in 1997 and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Columbia reissued an expanded version of the original ""Drums of Passion"" last year, and Mr. Olatunji completed a new album earlier this year."
11411,"Lou Maletta, 74, Pioneer of Gay-Oriented TV Programming","Lou Maletta, who founded the Gay Cable Network in 1982, when the gay rights movement was not receiving broad media attention, died on Nov. 2 in Kingston, N.Y.","Lou Maletta, who founded the Gay Cable Network in 1982, when the gay rights movement was not receiving broad media attention, died on Nov. 2 in Kingston, N.Y. He was 74. The cause was liver cancer, said Luke Valenti, his companion of 37 years. The network had its roots as a weekly program called ''Men & Film'' on Channel 35 on Manhattan Cable Television. Mr. Maletta showed gay pornographic movies that he had edited to make less explicit, and the programming grew to become a forum for the range of issues facing gay people. There had been gay-oriented television shows before the Gay Cable Network was started. But Mr. Maletta's enterprise was considered the first to produce weekly news, entertainment, political commentary, cultural and health-related programs, and it distributed them to public-access channels in 20 cities (at first on videotapes he mailed). ''It was critical to the L.G.B.T. rights movement,'' said Kenneth Sherrill, a political science professor at Hunter College who has written extensively on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. ''Mainstream television wasn't rushing to cover the movement, and public access cable provided entree for social and political groups that were traditionally excluded. Lou Maletta's programming allowed voices of the gay community to speak for themselves.'' Among those voices was Andy Humm, who is now the co-host, with Ann Northrop, of ''Gay U.S.A.,'' a weekly one-hour cable news program produced by Manhattan Neighborhood Network and distributed nationally. The show originated on the Gay Cable Network, which Mr. Maletta closed when he retired in 2001. ''Lou had this grand vision of a 24-hour gay cable network,'' Mr. Humm said. ''That didn't happen for him.'' Still, the continuation of ''Gay U.S.A.'' and the introduction in 2005 of Logo, a primarily gay-oriented 24-hour cable channel that is part of MTV Networks, have in part fulfilled his dream. ''Lou laid the groundwork,'' Mr. Humm said. ''He developed news programming, entertainment, sports. He had a guy come on every week and talk about the gay bowling league.'' Mr. Maletta's network began in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, and he enlisted officials from New York City's health department and Gay Men's Health Crisis, a nonprofit AIDS advocacy group, to provide segments. From 1984 to 2000, he provided coverage of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, interviewing political leaders from the floor and gay rights demonstrators in the streets. Those were among the dozens of local and national protests the network covered. In 1988, Mr. Maletta traveled with a team of volunteer correspondents to the Republican convention in New Orleans, by way of Mississippi. ''He was this tremendous character, generally wearing spandex, a black leather jacket, the Gay Network T-shirt and a cowboy hat,'' Mr. Humm recalled. ''Not unusual in New York, but try going to a Hardee's in Mississippi on the way to a convention. I didn't think we were going to get out alive.'' People just stared, Mr. Humm said. Louis Phillip Maletta Jr. was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 14, 1936, the only child of Louis and Mary Maletta. After serving in the Army, he became a freelance photographer and a travel agent, booking gay cruises. He was outside the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in summer 1969 when a police raid helped ignite the gay liberation movement, said Mr. Valenti, his companion. In addition to Mr. Valenti, Mr. Maletta is survived by a daughter from a marriage that ended in divorce. What motivated him to take his programming beyond its sexually explicit origins, Mr. Maletta told Gay City News in 2009, was watching a 30-year-old friend ''turning into someone who looked 90 six months after being diagnosed'' with what at one time was called gay-related immune deficiency. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

She was 91.","Edna Flannery Kelly, the first woman to represent Brooklyn in Congress and an expert in foreign affairs and social policy, died on Sunday at the home of her daughter in Alexandria, Va. She was 91. A lifelong New Yorker, she had moved to Alexandria in 1982 following a stroke. Mrs. Kelly, who had cancer, experienced another stroke shortly before her death, her daughter, Maura Patricia Kelly, said. For many of her 19 years as a Democrat in the House of Representatives, from 1949 to 1968, Mrs. Kelly was the sole woman in the New York delegation. When she left office, a departure brought about by shifting demographics in the borough, she was the third-ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mrs. Kelly joined Congress after winning a special election in 1949 to fill an unexpired term in the 10th Congressional District and she was re-elected nine times in landslide victories, later representing the 12th District. But after district lines were redrawn in 1968, she decided to challenge a strong incumbent, Emanuel Celler, in a different district and lost that race. Her reconfigured district sent Shirley Chisholm to Congress as Brooklyn's first black Representative. Edna Flannery was born in East Hampton on Long Island. Following her graduation from Hunter College in 1928, she married Edward L. Kelly, a lawyer active in Democratic politics who was a justice in the city court system. Mrs. Kelly herself had no political agenda initially, but her husband was killed in a car accident in 1942 and she later said she became active to carry on in his tradition. Her first job was to breathe life into the moribund women's auxiliary of Brooklyn's Madison Democratic Club, a hub of party activity. She later joined the county executive committee and took on the chore of research director for the Democrats in the State Legislature. In that position, she built the network that later assured her nomination for the vacant seat in 1949. She quickly became an expert on the Soviet bloc, led fact-finding missions throughout the world and, as head of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Europe, championed NATO and a strong Europe as a bulwark against international Communism. She also helped to write foreign-policy legislation that, among other things, created the Peace Corps. Serving during the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, she sponsored measures to settle displaced people after World War II and refugees from Russia and Eastern Europe. She helped create the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. She advocated women's and social issues, drawing attention to inequities in pay, credit and tax policy, including what she considered inadequate deductions for child care. She helped increase the deductions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Mrs. Kelly was used to easy re-election in one of the city's most densely populated districts, encompassing all or part of Flatbush, Crown Heights, Kensington, Borough Park and Bedford-Stuyvesant. During her tenure, the district's ethnic composition changed markedly, leading state legislators to reapportion the borough to acknowledge Bedford-Stuyvesant's growing black constituency. Unwilling to run against Ms. Chisholm, who soon became a leading candidate for that Congressional seat, Mrs. Kelly took on Representative Celler, the dean of the state's Congressional delegation. The race in the reconfigured 10th district pitted two party regulars against each other, and Mrs. Kelly, her power base gone, lost to Mr. Celler in the primary. Besides her daughter, Mrs. Kelly is survived by a son, William E. 2d, of Spring Lake, N.J.; a sister, Katherine Duryea of Amityville, N.Y.; eight grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren."

He was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan. Mr. Roth was chairman of the board of Emery Roth & Sons, which was founded by his father. He joined the firm in 1928 after his gradation from M.I.T. His son, Richard, is president. He guided the firm to a position of leadership in the design of more than 150 high-rise buildings and luxury hotels around the country. Most of them are in Manhattan, including the General Motors headquarters building on Fifth Avenue at 59th Street, the Park Lane Hotel on Central Park South and the Palace Hotel, a multi-use structure that incorporates a luxury hotel, apartments, stores, office space and the landmark Villard Houses on Madison Avenue, behind St. Patrick's Cathedral. Curtain Walls His firm also designed the Madison Hotel in Washington and the 350-room Sheraton Airport Hotel in Philadelphia. Mr. Roth is credited with making many contributions to contemporary design and construction, among them significant advances in the design of curtain walls, which are basically self-supporting enclosures. He was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1968 for his contribution to the ''science of construction.'' In 1967, Mr. Roth was among a group of architects that opposed plans to build an office building atop the waiting room of Grand Central Station. ''I feel the same way about Grand Central that I feel about the Plaza Hotel or the Custom House down at the Battery,'' he said. ''They've got to be saved.'' Father Founded Firm His father, Emery Roth, a Hungarian immigrant with no formal architectural training, founded the firm in 1903. He, too, added richly to Manhattan's skyline, filling it with apartment buildings, including the Belleclaire on Broadway at 77th Street, the San Remo on Central Park West and The Normandy at 140 Riverside Drive, at 86th Street. But while his father, who died in 1947, believed in masonry buildings, Richard Roth changed the image of the firm to one of high-rise glass and steel towers. In 1971, after two fires in New York City high-rise office buildings, Mr. Roth helped advise the city on new safety measures that were enacted and incorporated in the New York City Building Code. He served on the board of directors of the Federation of the Handicapped, helping it design a new building devoted to the training of the handicapped for jobs. He was born in Manhattan in 1904 and served in the Navy during World War II. He commanded the 35th Construction Battalion of Seabees and was awarded the Bronze Star for meritorioius service. He is survived by his brother, Julian, of Manhattan; two sons, Richard Jr., of Manhattan, and Emery, of Washington Depot, Conn.; four grandchildren, and a great-grandchild. Funeral services will be private, with a memorial service to be announced at a later date."
39667,"WILLIAM POLLOCK, UNIONIST, IS DEAD","William Pollock, general president of the Textile Workers Union of America from 1956 until 1972, died Wednesday at his home in Ocean City, N.J.","William Pollock, general president of the Textile Workers Union of America from 1956 until 1972, died Wednesday at his home in Ocean City, N.J. He was 82 years old. In 1976, four years after he retired as his union's president, the textile union merged with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America to form the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. It was a goal that Mr. Pollock had long sought to attain. Mr. Pollock was born in Philadelphia of Scottish parents who came to the United States in 1876. He was one of nine children, all of whom were later active in trade unionism. He left high school in 1914 to work as an office boy and later found work as a shipfitter. When the postwar depression hit, he went into the textile trade. He immediately joined Local 25, United Textile Workers, forerunner of the T.W.U.A., and became skilled as a negotiator and union official. In 1931, he became business agent of Local 25 and, in 1937, when the United Textile Workers voted to affiliate with the Congress of Industrial Organizations he joined the staff of the textile workers' organizing committee. He helped set up the Textile Joint Board in Philadelphia and was its first manager. When other unions in the industry decided to band together and form the Textile Workers Union of America, Mr. Pollock, at its first constitutional convention, was elected general secretary-treasurer, He was re-elected to that post until 1953, when he was elected executive vice president. When Emil Rieve, the union's first general president, did not seek re-election in 1956 because of ill health, Mr. Pollock was elected unanimously to the post. He was re-elected to seven more two-year terms. Mr. Pollock was a member of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council from 1967 until his retirement. He is survived by his wife, Anna; two sons, William Jr. and Kenneth, both of Philadelphia, and five grandchildren."
28406,"Eddie Shipstad, 91, Skater and Founder of Touring Ice Show","Eddie Shipstad, a onetime Minnesota rink rat who learned early that a little fancy skating would attract a crowd on the ponds of St. Paul, then made a fortune proving that a lot of fancy skating would draw throngs across the country, died on Aug. 20 at his home in Los Angeles.","Eddie Shipstad, a onetime Minnesota rink rat who learned early that a little fancy skating would attract a crowd on the ponds of St. Paul, then made a fortune proving that a lot of fancy skating would draw throngs across the country, died on Aug. 20 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 91 and a founder of the Shipstad and Johnson Ice Follies, the first of the traveling extravaganzas on ice. There were ice shows before Eddie Shipstad came along with his comic skating partner, Oscar Johnson, and his top-hatted little brother, Roy Shipstad, but until the three put their show on the road in 1936, ice shows tended to be small one-shot amateur charity productions, entertainment between periods at hockey games or occasional nightclub engagements. Considering how popular traveling ice shows became, it was a wonder nobody had thought of them before. Somebody undoubtedly had. The logic was compelling. Like circuses, an ice show that would quickly run out of potential customers in a given city could find an endless supply of fresh audiences simply by moving from city to city. But unlike circuses, which had catered to loyal audiences since the 19th century, ice shows were new, and when they came of age in the Depression, entrepreneurs were reluctant to find out if a traveling ice show was worth the risk. After all, who knew if ice shows would attract enough paying customers to justify the transportation and other costs? Well, Eddie Shipstad knew, and so did his friend, Oscar Johnson. Since they were children, the two had been giving impromptu performances on frozen Minnesota rivers and ponds, sometimes attracting so many fans that the police were concerned that the audience would plunge through the ice. The son of Swedish immigrants, Mr. Shipstad, whose father worked at a foundry in a job that barely brought in enough to feed his 10 children, began dreaming early on about the possibilities of earning a living from skating. Aware that he was not good enough for a professional hockey career, he concentrated on his athletic stunts and fancy skating skills, teaming up with Mr. Johnson to work out elaborate comic skits. Along with Mr. Shipstad's brother, Roy, the young men haunted local rinks, sweeping the ice in exchange for skating time. By the late 1920's, the pair had attracted such local renown that they were hired to perform at St. Paul hockey games, which led to a five-year stint at Madison Square Garden, where they entertained fans at Ranger games by, among other comic turns, using a simple blanket to transform themselves into a skating horse, with Mr. Shipstad gamely bringing up the rear. In the wake of their success in New York, the Shipstad brothers and Mr. Johnson recruited other skaters in 1935 to put on a show at the St. Paul Auditorium that became the model for the Follies the next year. After what turned out to be a 16-month engagement at the Sherman Hotel in Chicago (after the performance, the ice would be covered with a plywood dance floor), they had enough money to mount a show and take it on the road. At a time when arena managers were desperate for attractions, their timing proved perfect, but not right away. Their first stop, in Tulsa, Okla., coincided with a local polio epidemic and drew such a small audience that after counting the meager house, Mr. Johnson delivered a famous reassurance to the nervous troupe. ""Don't worry,"" he said, ""We've got them outnumbered."" Within a few weeks, however, the Follies were packing them in at every stop, delighting audiences with a fast-paced show featuring elaborate costumes, daring stunts, elegant ice dances, Roy Shipstad as a top-hatted soloist and a show-stopping number in which Mr. Johnson and Mr. Shipstad performed a raucous skid-row routine as Spike McDuff (Mr. Johnson) and Gashouse Annie (Mr. Shipstad). The success led to a movie, ""The Ice Follies of 1939,"" starring Joan Crawford, James Stewart and Lew Ayres, along with the Shipstads, Mr. Johnson and other Follies skaters. The movie was a flop, but the real Follies continued to be such a sensational success that when the partners declined to form a second company, arena managers spurred the creation of copycat rival, the Icecapades, in 1940. The partners stopped performing in the 1940's and sold the Follies for $3.5 million in 1954. It was eventually absorbed by Disney on Ice. Mr. Johnson died in the 1960's, and Roy Shipstad died in 1975. Mr. Shipstad is survived by three sons, Eddie, of Grand Rapids, Mich., Bob, of Orcas Island, Wash., and Don, of Los Angeles; a brother, George, of Los Angeles, nine grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren."

Ballet Star","Katharine Sergava, a dancer and actress who portrayed Laurey in Agnes de Mille's dream ballet in the original Broadway production of ''Oklahoma!,'' died on Nov. 26 at her home in Manhattan.","Katharine Sergava, a dancer and actress who portrayed Laurey in Agnes de Mille's dream ballet in the original Broadway production of ''Oklahoma!,'' died on Nov. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 or 96. Her death was reported yesterday by a longtime friend, Ann Berlin. An erroneous report of Ms. Sergava's death appeared in The New York Times on Dec. 4, 2003. Ms. Sergava was born in Tiflis (now Tblisi) in Georgia on July 30, 1909 or 1910 (she gave both dates). She fled Russia with her family during the Revolution and settled for a time in London. She studied drama and ballet in London and Paris and later emigrated to the United States. In New York, she danced with the Mordkin Ballet, Ballet Theater, now known as American Ballet Theater, and the Original Ballet Russe, as Col. W. de Basil's Ballet Russe then called itself. She danced the part of Laurey from the opening of ''Oklahoma!'' in 1943 until 1947. She was then cast in ''Look Ma, I'm Dancing,'' choreographed by Jerome Robbins. In 1956, she took over Lotte Lenya's role in ''The Threepenny Opera.'' She also appeared in a variety of plays, including ''Dial M for Murder'' and Jean Cocteau's ''The Typewriter,'' and she toured in Shaw's ''Misalliance.'' She taught drama at HB Studios in New York for more than 30 years. Her husband, Bernard Sznycer, died in 1970. She leaves no immediate survivors."
38530,"Canaan Banana, 67, Zimbabwe Ex-President","The Rev. Canaan Banana, Zimbabwe's first post-independence president, who was convicted and jailed for sodomy, died Monday after a long illness, state television reported.","HARARE, Zimbabwe, Nov. 10 The Rev. Canaan Banana, Zimbabwe's first post-independence president, who was convicted and jailed for sodomy, died Monday after a long illness, state television reported. He was 67. Mr. Banana's presidency was largely ceremonial, and Robert Mugabe, prime minister since independence in 1980, took over the presidency in 1987. In May 2000, the Zimbabwe Supreme Court upheld Mr. Banana's conviction for sodomy and jailed him for a year. During the trial, a former aide testified that in the 1980's, Mr. Banana drank, danced and played cards with him before drugging and raping him. Mr. Banana insisted throughout the case that he was not a homosexual and said the accusations against him were part of a vendetta. His conviction damaged his image as a broker for unity in 1987 between Zimbabwe's two main political parties, bringing to an end an army crackdown on Mr. Mugabe's opponents, which rights groups say left 20,000 civilians dead. Although he stayed out of the limelight after leaving prison, Mr. Banana addressed public debates, where he criticized the political crisis in Zimbabwe that has developed since 1999 with the emergence of the Movement for Democratic Change, an opposition coalition that poses the biggest challenge to Mr. Mugabe's 23-year rule."
35072,"James Reston, for Many Years a Nonpareil Among American Journalists, Dies at 86","James Reston, former columnist, Washington correspondent and executive editor of The New York Times, died on Wednesday night at his home here.","WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 James Reston, former columnist, Washington correspondent and executive editor of The New York Times, died on Wednesday night at his home here. He was 86. The cause was cancer, said his son Thomas. First as a reporter and then, beginning in 1953, as a columnist, Mr. Reston was perhaps the most influential journalist of his generation. In Washington, where he was based, and also in other capitals around the world, he had unrivaled access to the high and the mighty. Yet he retained a wry, self-deprecating personality, free of bombast, and always sought to reduce political complexity to plain language. ""What I try to do,"" he said, ""is write a letter to a friend who doesn't have time to find out all the goofy things that go on in Washington."" Interested in China and the Soviet Union as well as the United States, a student of diplomacy as well as domestic politics, he won two Pulitzer Prizes and dozens of other awards. Mr. Reston was forgiving of the frailties of soldiers, statesmen and party hacks -- too forgiving, some of his critics later said, because he was too close to them. But his stern moral standards, rooted in the Victorian values of his youth, never wavered. He remained an idealist in a world of cynics. From his strong-minded mother he inherited a Presbyterian conscience and an abiding sense of duty and responsibility. Work hard, he was taught. Work for large goals that transcend self-interest. A talent scout of prodigious capacity, Mr. Reston hired and trained many of The Times's best-known journalists, and served as mentor to many more. To each of them, he passed along a lifetime's lessons about craft and country. Mr. Reston's 50-year association with The Times began when he joined its London bureau on Sept. 1, 1939, the day Hitler's armies marched into Poland, igniting World War II. It was a fitting day on which to start his career at the paper, much of which would be spent recording and reflecting upon the aftermath of that fateful day. His nationally syndicated column appeared regularly until 1987, when he became senior columnist. He retired from The Times in 1989, without ceremony, on his 80th birthday. In an interview marking the occasion, he said the two greatest political triumphs in his lifetime had been the common defense system developed by the West after World War II and the improvement in the lot of black people in America since 1960. Mr. Reston, who was born in Scotland, described the men who met in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft the Constitution as the great heroes in his adopted country's history. The document that they produced, he said, made possible ""the triumph of the moderates"" over the next two centuries. A moderate himself, hostile to both fascism and communism, he described journalism's role in their eclipse as ""one of the great pleasures of my life."" Asked whom he had most admired, he cited Franklin D. Roosevelt as the finest President he had known and Dean Acheson, Secretary of State in the Truman Administration, as ""the key man"" who ""came to the fork in the road"" and concluded that containing the Soviet Union would require a new alliance. But he chose Jean Monnet, the French visionary who conceived the European Community, as the greatest man he had ever known as well as the person who had most deeply influenced his own thinking. Monnet proved, Mr. Reston often said, that ""if you don't demand credit for things, you can push them through."" First and Foremost, A Dogged Reporter Mr. Reston thought of himself primarily as a reporter, and he often beat his competitors to be the first to write about major news events. His coverage of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington in 1944, which laid the groundwork for the United Nations, was one of the era's most important exclusives and won him his first Pulitzer, in 1945. Those articles disclosed the substance of secret documents that were then being circulated among delegations from the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China on the structure of the proposed international organization. Mr. Reston won his second Pulitzer in 1957 for distinguished reporting from Washington. The articles cited were written in June 1956 and analyzed the effects of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's illness on the functioning of the executive branch. He was also responsible for The Times's publication in 1955 of the documents of the 1945 Yalta Conference. And in 1954 he disclosed that J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had directed the making of the first atomic bomb, had subsequently been denied access to secret documents by the Atomic Energy Commission because of suspicion that he was passing information to the Soviet Union, a charge of which Oppenheimer was later cleared. One exclusive dispatch came by accident. In 1971, as one of the first American reporters allowed into China, Mr. Reston developed appendicitis. His report about his surgery and postoperative acupuncture treatment, filed from his bed in the Anti-Imperialist Hospital in the capital, ran on the front page under the headline ""Now, About My Operation in Peking."" 'My Own Opinions Aren't That Good' From the 1950's on, Mr. Reston interviewed most of the world's leaders, often producing major news accounts that were scrutinized at the State Department for their every nuance. The interviews often bore the special Reston stamp: He sought to reveal not only the policies and the politics of the people he interviewed, but also their vision of life and their view of history. Mr. Reston, who was called Scotty by virtually everyone who knew him, was 5 feet 8 inches tall and had a round and ruddy face, gray-green eyes, an ever-present pipe and an invariably pleasant manner. He was courteous not only to officials but also to the young people who worked for him. ""He believes in hard work, in thrift, honor your parents, woman's place is in the home, play by the rules and live clean,"" his colleague Russell Baker once said. Mr. Reston was credited by competitors with having more high-level news sources in Washington than almost any other reporter, although some critics felt that he was too kind in print to some of them. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith, reviewing Mr. Reston's ""The Artillery of the Press,"" a 1967 collection of his talks before the Council on Foreign Relations, suggested that Mr. Reston had learned to his disadvantage ""to treat all people in the manner of a newspaperman who must one day go back and see them again."" But in a 1980 article in The New Republic, Mr. Reston was quoted as saying: ""If you spend your life as a hatchet man -- and there's something to be said for that -- then eventually you find that everybody's out to lunch when you call. You're left with only your own opinion. I wouldn't like that because my own opinions aren't that good."" Writing his column three times a week, Mr. Reston was a procrastinator, often filing right on deadline. A two-finger typist, he regularly wore out typewriters because he banged so hard on the keys, and his desk was a litter of papers, many of which bore tiny black marks where a stream of smoldering matches had landed in the course of a never-ending pipe-lighting ritual. His columns, laced with quotations from Walter Lippmann, H. G. Wells, Matthew Arnold and Churchill, were a combination of high moral tone, detailed reporting, allusions to sports, impish humor and evocative descriptions of seasonal changes along the Potomac. They seldom offered absolute judgments about people or events; he used the word ""maybe"" more than most pundits. His first column, on Oct. 18, 1953, established the Reston style. ""This town is still full of echoes from the days of America's isolation,"" he wrote of Washington. ""It has changed in policy and personnel, more than any other world capital in the last generation. No nation has taken on so much or moved so far in such a hurry. Yet the habits of the past, like the bent figures of homeless former senators, still haunt the capital."" Press and Politics: 'Like Cats and Dogs' He often returned to certain themes, such as the role of the press. In his column of Oct. 30, 1968, when Spiro T. Agnew, soon to be elected Vice President, was denouncing news organizations, Mr. Reston wrote: ""The candidates and the press are fussing at each other again, and this is the way it should be. They have different jobs, and in many ways they are natural enemies, like cats and dogs. The first job of the candidate is to win, and he usually says what he thinks will help him win. The job of the reporter is to report what happens and decontaminate as much of the political poison as he can. The conflict is obvious."" In addition to his two Pulitzer Prizes, Mr. Reston was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1986 and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Award in 1991. He received the Overseas Press Club award for interpretation of international news three times, the George Polk Memorial Award for national reporting and the French Legion of Honor, and was named Commander, Order of the British Empire. He also received 28 honorary degrees. After retiring, he fulfilled a longtime promise to his wife, Sally, by writing his memoirs. Titled ""Deadline,"" they were published by Random House in 1991. Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Ronald Steel, author of ""Walter Lippmann and the American Century,"" called Mr. Reston ""the quintessential Washington insider."" ""Officials used him to test out new ideas on the public or to drop leaks for which they did not want to be held accountable,"" Mr. Steel wrote. ""Because of his high position at The Times and his personal integrity, he was trusted both by those who provided the news and by those who read it. ""But what he did so well and so usefully for so long could not be done today. Journalism and the political world have changed too much."" Mr. Reston is survived by his wife; his sons, Richard F. Reston of Edgartown, Mass., James B. Reston Jr. of Chevy Chase, Md., and Thomas B. Reston of Washington; his sister, Joanna Richey of Santa Cruz, Calif., and five grandchildren. Funeral services will be held at 10 A.M. on Saturday at Saint Albans Church on the grounds of the Washington National Cathedral. Born in Scotland To Years of Poverty James Barrett Reston began life about as far from the Washington power center as one could get. He was born in Clydebank, Scotland, on Nov. 3, 1909, the son of James, a machinist, and Johanna Irving Reston. The Restons migrated to the United States when he was an infant, but Mrs. Reston became ill, and the family returned to Scotland. There followed years of harsh poverty, of life in a brick tenement where young James and his sister slept crosswise at the foot of their parents' bed. In 1920 the family returned to the United States and settled in Dayton, Ohio. His father worked for the Delco Remy Division of General Motors. When his parents were naturalized, young James automatically became an American citizen. In 1932, he graduated from the University of Illinois with an undistinguished academic record. He had majored in journalism, skipping the course in governmental reporting but getting an A in sportswriting. During his high school years he caddied at the Dayton Country Club golf course. His own game became so good that he twice won the Ohio state public links championship and at Illinois was captain of the Big Ten championship golf team in 1932. His father wanted him to become a golf pro. His mother wanted him to be a preacher, which, he was to say later, is really what he became. In the winters during his school days, he hung around The Dayton Daily News. ""When the phone rang, I'd pick it up and take down the scores,"" he later recalled. ""And from that I just moved into newspapering. I never thought of anything else."" Another link to the world of newspapers was Gov. James M. Cox, the Ohio publisher and 1920 Democratic Presidential candidate, for whom young Reston had caddied. Mr. Cox gave him his first job after college on one of the Cox newspapers in Ohio, The Springfield Daily News, where he earned $10 a week as the sports editor. Later he was hired as traveling secretary and publicity director for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. In 1934 he moved to New York as a sportswriter for the Associated Press Feature Service. The next year he married Sally Jane Fulton, a former college classmate who had been president of her sorority, an A student and a Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year. Named Sara but always called Sally, she was the daughter of a judge from Sycamore, Ill., a small town near Chicago. Mr. Reston once told a University of Illinois graduating class, ""I should say in passing that I myself married a recklessly beautiful girl whom I first saw on Wright Street wearing a scarlet coat."" ""My gal Sal,"" as he called her in the dedication of ""Sketches in the Sand,"" a collection of his columns published in 1967, became his closest confidante, frequent collaborator and steadiest supporter. They had three sons, and Mr. Reston's own happy situation made him a champion of marriage. He was forever asking his young bachelor colleagues when they were going to wed. In 1937 The Associated Press sent Mr. Reston to London on a rather loose dual assignment: in summer covering sports events, in winter the British Foreign Office. In 1939 he joined The Times's London bureau, with a salary of $85 a week. He was so little known on the foreign desk in New York that his first byline in The Times had his name wrong -- John instead of James. Then came the London blitz. The Times's office for much of the war was on the seventh floor of the Reuters Building on Fleet Street, which offered a view of the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. He described this view of the battle in his first book, ""Prelude to Victory."" ""Before we got better sense, we used to put the lights off in the Times office every night and watch this effort,"" he wrote. ""With uncanny regularity, the German bombers would come over just about 10 minutes after blackout and start dropping incendiary bombs all over this section. About an hour before we could see the flames, we would begin to hear the steady throb of scores of engines along the banks of the Thames; these were the pumps, driving the muddy water from the river up through miles of new hose. . . . ""A little later the sky would begin to change in color from midnight blue to a reddish glow, and soon the great dome of the cathedral would stand out in silhouette against the flames of perhaps a dozen raging fires. Night after night we watched this incredible scene, and morning after morning we marveled at the fact that the fires were somehow put out."" In December 1940 he was reassigned to Washington, and in 1942 published ""Prelude to Victory,"" a call to action that was acclaimed here and abroad. Its theme was pure Reston: Unless Americans put aside personal aims and materialistic thinking and made sacrifices in a crusade for their country, the war would not be won. In late 1942, Elmer Davis, head of the Office of War Information, obtained a leave of absence from The Times for Mr. Reston and sent him to London to set up the agency's effort there. John G. Winant, the United States Ambassador to Britain, recommended him to Arthur Hays Sulzberger, then president and publisher of The Times, who was looking for an assistant. It was the beginning of Mr. Reston's close friendship with the Sulzberger family. After the War Years, Washington for Good Mr. Reston returned to Washington and was named national correspondent in 1945. He made his mark with his coverage of Dumbarton Oaks, which illustrated a Reston maxim: Seek out the disgruntled party. His theory was that people who were disenchanted were more likely to talk candidly. In this case, it was the Chinese representatives to the conference who were disenchanted. In his memoirs, Mr. Reston told of having met Chen Yi, one of the Chinese delegates, before the war through Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, wife of The Times's publisher. At Mr. Reston's urging, Chen Yi slipped him the texts of the proposals. Instead of writing one long article, Mr. Reston doled out the information, producing an exclusive a day. The Russians thought Washington had leaked the material; Washington suspected the British, and the F.B.I. started an investigation of Mr. Reston. In 1948 Mr. Reston became diplomatic correspondent for The Times, and in 1953 he became Washington bureau chief, succeeding Arthur Krock. He continued as bureau chief until 1964, when he elected to step down to concentrate on his column. In 1968 he was summoned to New York by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who had become publisher, to succeed Turner Catledge as executive editor, in charge of the entire news operation. The internal politics of the news department had received publicity after an unsuccessful effort by editors in New York to exert more control over the Washington bureau. Mr. Reston's mandate was to re-establish peace. For 13 months he ran the news department while commuting to Washington a few times a week to write his column. It was an almost impossible job. In 1969, knowing that he had to choose between his column and the editor's post, he gladly chose the column. Mr. Reston was eminently a Washington man. He loved and understood the capital. Moreover, he had helped shape the Washington bureau. These were his people, and many of them regarded him as a father figure. The New York office seemed to him a vast, impersonal beehive. During these years the Restons lived in a pleasant red brick house on Woodley Road in leafy northwest Washington and spent weekends at their log cabin in Fiery Run, Va. Mr. Reston often used Fiery Run as the dateline on his Thoreau-like columns about the restorative life in the country. In 1968 the Restons purchased The Vineyard Gazette, a 122-year-old weekly on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where they vacationed in the summer. Their son Richard is now editor and publisher, and his wife, Mary Jo, is publisher and general manager. Two Cuba Episodes And the Pentagon Papers Mr. Reston played a part in the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 and in two other major news events involving The Times in questions of national security. The others were the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. In the spring of 1961, The Times was preparing to publish an article by Tad Szulc reporting that 5,000 or 6,000 Cuban exiles who had been training in the United States and in Central America for nine months were about to launch an invasion of Cuba to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro. The article was planned for page 1 on April 7, under a four-column headline. But Orvil Dryfoos, then the publisher, was troubled by the security implications of the report. On April 6, he and Mr. Catledge, then managing editor, telephoned Mr. Reston, who advised them not to publish the article and cautioned against giving away the proposed timing of the landing as ""imminent."" The article was published on April 7 under a one-column headline and with no mention of the invasion's date. The Bay of Pigs invasion took place 10 days later and ended in debacle. President John F. Kennedy, who took full responsibility, said that if The Times had published more about the operation, it might have saved the Administration from making such a colossal mistake. ""If I had it to do over, I would do exactly what we did at the time,"" Mr. Reston said later. ""It is ridiculous to think that publishing the fact that the invasion was imminent would have avoided this disaster."" In 1962 Mr. Reston was apparently the only reporter who had found out that the Soviet Union, then under the leadership of Nikita S. Khrushchev, had secreted nuclear missiles in Cuba, only 90 miles from Florida. When Kennedy realized that Mr. Reston had the information, he telephoned him directly. Four years later, Mr. Reston recounted the incident to Clifton Daniel, then managing editor of The Times. ""The President told me that he was going on television on Monday evening to report to the American people,"" Mr. Reston recalled. ""He said that if we published the news about the missiles, Khrushchev could actually give him an ultimatum before he went on the air. ""I told the President I would report to my office in New York,"" Mr. Reston continued. ""And if my advice was asked, I would recommend that we not publish. It was not my duty to decide."" Kennedy then called Mr. Dryfoos, the publisher, and asked him not to print Mr. Reston's article. Mr. Dryfoos left the matter up to Mr. Reston and his staff, and the article was withheld. It was a different story, however, in 1971 when The Times obtained and published what became known as the Pentagon Papers, the Government's top-secret documents on the Vietnam War. Seeing this at once as ""the story of the century,"" Mr. Reston was one of the editors who felt that the documents should be published because they were history and therefore no question of national security was involved. One of Mr. Reston's contributions to journalism was the corps of young reporters he discovered and developed. In 1961 he instituted a program of internships for young would-be reporters, modeled on the clerkships at the United States Supreme Court and suggested to him by the late Justice Felix Frankfurter. Each year he would recruit a new college graduate as his clerk and researcher. He paid a price for this program, as time and again the young clerks with lofty journalistic thoughts would mix up his airline reservations or keep the Secretary of State waiting because they had failed to cancel a scheduled appointment. Linda Greenhouse, who went on to report on the Supreme Court for The Times, recalled that on her first day as a clerk, Mr. Reston asked her to get Ted Sorensen on the phone and suggested she try Paul Weiss in New York. After trying every Weiss-comma-Paul in the Manhattan phone book, she reported back to Mr. Reston. ""He didn't groan, tear his hair or -- more important, and the reason for my undying gratitude -- laugh at me,"" Ms. Greenhouse said. ""He gently explained that Paul, Weiss was a New York law firm where Ted Sorensen was working, looked up the number and gave it to me."" It was perhaps this quality, this unfailing kindliness, that constituted his special attractiveness. It enabled him to view the faults and frailties of the world with compassion and to carry on in the belief that the best in mankind would eventually win out over the worst. ""Stick with the optimists, Niftie,"" he wrote in a column in February 1980, welcoming his new grandson, Devin Fitzgerald Reston, to the human race. ""It's going to be tough enough even if they're right."""
7760,"Dirk Bogarde, 78, Matinee Idol Turned Serious Actor, Dies","Dirk Bogarde, who transformed himself from Britain's top matinee idol into a serious actor at the age of 40 and became an international star, died yesterday at his home in London.","Dirk Bogarde, who transformed himself from Britain's top matinee idol into a serious actor at the age of 40 and became an international star, died yesterday at his home in London. He was 78. The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported, quoting a nephew, Brock Van den Bogaerde. The actor, who was knighted in 1992, suffered a stroke in 1996 and had been under 24-hour nursing care since last May, the A.P. said. Nicknamed the British Rock Hudson, Sir Dirk was Britain's leading movie star during the 1950's, when he starred in adventure films and lightweight comedies, among them an immensely popular series that included ""Doctor in the House"" (1954), ""Doctor at Sea"" (1956), ""Doctor at Large"" (1957) and ""Doctor in Distress"" (1963). In the 1960's, Sir Dirk gave a series of brilliant performances as intelligent, complex and often morally compromised men in such movies as ""The Servant,"" ""King and Country,"" ""Darling"" and ""Accident."" In 1961, Sir Dirk celebrated his freedom after 14 years as a contract player with the Rank Organization by starring as a repressed homosexual lawyer who defies a gang of blackmailers in Basil Dearden's ""Victim."" Excluding an early bit part, ""Victim"" was his 34th film. Homosexuality was then a taboo subject and a criminal offense, but his performance brought acclaim to the handsome, debonair actor -- who had been known in England as ""the idol of the Odeons,"" the chain of theaters owned by Rank. ""For the first time I was playing my own age,"" he told a reporter in 1965. ""At Rank, the fixed rule was that I had to look pretty. 'Victim' ended all that nonsense."" Two years later Sir Dirk found another role to match his talents -- a sinister valet who corrupts his upper-class master in ""The Servant"" (1963). The second of five movies that Sir Dirk made with the American expatriate director Joseph Losey and the first of two written for him by Harold Pinter, ""The Servant"" was a psychologically complex portrait of malice. His performance as the cunning but outwardly servile servant won Sir Dirk the first of two British Academy Awards. He won again in 1965 as a television reporter who leaves his wife and children for a party girl, Julie Christie, in John Schlesinger's ""Darling."" Before ""Victim,"" Sir Dirk had approached the director David Lean in hope of being considered for one of his films. ""I think Dirk's great,"" Mr. Lean told someone, ""but I want an actor, not a movie star."" ""That hurt a little,"" Sir Dirk said after his success in ""The Servant."" ""So I decided to hell with the glamour-boy bit and got into the field of character acting."" The new career that began at 40 for Sir Dirk led him to work with many of the major European directors. For Luchino Visconti, he played the doomed writer von Aschenbach in the film version of Thomas Mann's novella ""Death in Venice"" (1971); for Alain Resnais, he was a lawyer in ""Providence"" (1977); for Rainer Werner Fassbinder, he was a Russian emigre in ""Despair"" (1978), and for Bertrand Tavernier, he was a dying father in ""Daddy Nostalgia"" (1990), his final film. Sir Dirk did little acting after 1978, but published five novels and chronicled his life in seven well-received memoirs. He was born Derek Niven Van den Bogaerde in London on March 28, 1921. His father, who was half-Dutch, was the first art editor of The Times of London; his mother, an actress before her marriage, was the daughter of an artist and actor, Forrest Niven. The picture that Sir Dirk painted in his first autobiography, ""A Postillion Struck by Lightning"" (1977), was of a cloudless childhood in Sussex and distant, elegant parents who left the rearing of young Dirk and his sister Elizabeth to a beloved nanny. Reticent in print as well as shy in person, Sir Dirk drew a veil over his parents until a much later memoir, ""Cleared for Take Off"" (1995), when he revealed that his mother was an alcoholic ""with a liver like an Aegean sponge"" and his father capable of ruinous cruelty. By his mid-teens, Sir Dirk had decided to be an actor, although he was a talented painter and won a scholarship at 16 to the Royal College of Art. Instead, he put his skill to work painting sets at a theater in suburban London. He was 19 and had graduated to walk-ons and bit roles when World War II intervened. As an officer in Army Intelligence, he spent his days interpreting aerial photographs of bombing raids and his rest periods painting the devastation of Europe. He carried his sketchbook up the beach on D-Day. Discharged as a major in 1946, Sir Dirk was an overnight success when he starred as the troubled son of a working-class family in the play ""Power Without Glory,"" in 1947. After signing with the Rank Organization, Sir Dirk was thrown into three movies a year, often playing a criminal or someone suspected of a crime. He won good reviews as the neurotic pianist who commits suicide in ""Quartet"" (1949). He was to earn even better reviews as a young killer in ""The Blue Lamp"" (1950), directed by Mr. Dearden. In 1953, Sir Dirk made the list of Britain's top 10 box-office stars. His willingness to play a young hoodlum befriended by a psychiatrist (Alexander Knox) in Mr. Losey's film noir ""The Sleeping Tiger"" (1954) gave Mr. Losey afresh start in England after he fled a subpoena from the House Un-American Activities Committee. After Sir Dirk's performance as the bumbling young Simon Sparrow in ""Doctor in the House,"" he was England's top box-office star in 1955, 1957, 1958 and 1959. Throughout his career, Sir Dirk resisted offers from Hollywood. But he did go to Hollywood once, to play the composer Franz Liszt in the mediocre ""Song Without End"" (1960). In 1963, in London, he starred opposite Judy Garland in her last film, the musical ""I Could Go On Singing."" His other American films -- ""The Fixer"" (1968) and ""Justine"" (1969) -- were made abroad. Waylaid by fame and often resenting it, Sir Dirk retreated from the stage, from easy stardom and, finally, from England. In 1969, he bought a house in the south of France and lived there with his manager and companion Anthony Forward. Mr. Forward, who was formerly married to the actress Glynis Johns, shared Sir Dirk's life for 40 years. After Mr. Forward's death, Sir Dirk lived quietly in a small London apartment. Information on survivors was not immediately available. http://www.nytimes.com"

La Guardia, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital.","Morris S. Novik, who directed WNYC, the municipal radio station, during the administration of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital. Mr. Novik, who lived in Chelsea, would have turned 93 on Friday. His sister, Mary Pepperman of Manhattan, said he died from injuries suffered in a fall. It was during Mr. Novik's tenure that the Mayor made two of the most memorable broadcasts in radio history, on July 1 and July 8, 1945, when he read the Sunday comics to the children of the city during a newspaper strike. After his nearly eight years at WNYC, Mr. Novik and his brother Harry bought and operated a number of radio stations, among them WLIB, which they later sold. He became a founder of the La Guardia Memorial Association, which was a force in the creation of the Fiorello H. La Guardia Community College in Queens and the La Guardia High School of Music and Arts in Manhattan. He was a consultant on broadcasting to George Meany, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and his successor, Lane Kirkland. But Mr. Novik's most prominent role was as director of WNYC, a post he held from Feb. 9, 1938, when the Mayor administered the oath for the $7,500-a-year job, until he resigned Dec. 31, 1945, at the end of Mayor La Guardia's three terms. While Mr. Novik was director, the station, founded in 1924, was subjected to charges that it disseminated Communist propaganda and that the Mayor used it for political purposes. The City Council became so embarrassed by WNYC's broadcasts of its proceedings -- so amusing that some listeners hurried to City Hall to actually witness the fun -- that it voted in 1940 to ban the broadcasts. While all this was going on, Mr. Novik busied himself by improving WNYC's programming and reputation. He increased its presentation of classical music, championed the works of American composers and supported civic and educational programs and an emphasis on the American way of life. ""Within the city's confines, more than 7.5 million people live and work and go quietly about their business,"" he said in 1941. ""Our job, the job of a municipal radio station, is to make their lives better and fuller. We feel that one of the ways we can play our part in the community is by bringing home to New Yorkers the wonders of their city and keeping them in touch with the many things that happen in it. Doing that makes for greater interest and understanding and for a pride in this great democracy in which we all live."" On public affairs programs like ""The Schools Speak,"" gifted students engaged in extemporaneous discussions on significant topics. On ""America in Story,"" short stories offered a literary tour of America. Dramatic sketches from history and literature were presented in cooperation with the New York Principals Association. In 1945, the station received a Peabody Award for public service. It had won other honors from the National Association of Composers and Authors and the Institute for Radio Education. Mr. Novik, who was born in Nevel in northwestern Russia, came to the United States at 13 as the eldest of the five children of Samuel and Rose Novik. The Noviks settled in what is now the East Village. With only an elementary school education, Mr. Novik went to work for various socialist and labor organizations. By his early 20's, he had become the entertainment director of Unity House, a vacation resort in the Poconos that was operated by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. By the mid-1920's, he was the chairman of the Young People's Socialist League, sometimes referred to as the Yipsels, which proselytized for socialism and the Socialist Party among public school students. When Mayor La Guardia appointed him director of WNYC, he was a secretary to the New York County Committee of the American Labor Party. Mr. Novik's wife of 62 years, the former Manya Davidson, died in 1993."

7363,"Bud Shrake, 77, Sportswriter and Author","Bud Shrake, a Texas sportswriter and novelist who collaborated with the legendary golf teacher Harvey Penick on the best-selling sports title of all time, died on Friday in Austin, Tex.","Bud Shrake, a Texas sportswriter and novelist who collaborated with the legendary golf teacher Harvey Penick on the best-selling sports title of all time, died on Friday in Austin, Tex. He was 77. The cause was lung cancer, his son Ben told The Associated Press. Mr. Shrake, who began working for Sports Illustrated in the mid-1960s and, with writers like Dan Jenkins and Frank Deford, contributed the wild, rambling accounts that helped the magazine redefine sports journalism, wrote more than 10 novels, most set in Texas. He also wrote as-told-to autobiographies of the singer Willie Nelson and the University of Oklahoma football coach Barry Switzer. His work with Penick, who died in 1995, earned the kind of payoff that struggling writers can only dream of. Penick, the golf pro at the Austin Country Club for 50 years, kept a red notebook in which he jotted his thoughts on golf and stories about the famous players he coached. By chance he mentioned the notebook to Mr. Shrake, who immediately contacted his agent. A deal was struck with Simon & Schuster, which published ''Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings from a Lifetime of Golf'' in 1992. The book stayed on the best-seller lists for more than a year, selling 1.3 million copies and moving ahead of John Feinstein's ''Season on the Brink'' to become the best-selling hardcover sports book in history. Edwin Shrake Jr. was born in Fort Worth and attended Paschal High School, where he worked on the school paper with Mr. Jenkins, the future author of ''Semi-Tough.'' He started out in journalism as a police reporter at The Fort Worth Press while attending Texas Christian University, where he earned a degree in English and philosophy in 1954. After working as a sports reporter for The Dallas Times-Herald and The Dallas Morning News, he joined the staff of Sports Illustrated, for which he wrote until 1979. In 1962 Mr. Shrake published his first novel, ''Blood Reckoning,'' about the Comanche's final battle against the United States Army, a subject to which he returned in ''The Borderland: A Novel of Texas'' (2000). ''Blessed McGill'' (1968), set during Reconstruction, is often cited as a classic of Texas fiction, as is ''Strange Peaches'' (1972), an acidic portrait of Dallas at the time of the Kennedy assassination. In the early 1980s Mr. Shrake tried his luck in Hollywood. With the novelist Thomas McGuane, he wrote the screenplay for the 1980 Steve McQueen western ''Tom Horn.'' He also wrote the screenplay for ''Songwriter,'' a 1984 musical road film with Mr. Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. His two marriages ended in divorce. In recent years, he had been the companion of Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas. In addition to Ben, he is survived by another son, Alan; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren."
6858,"Irene Worth, Versatile Award-Winning Actress on Stage and Screen, Dies at 85","Irene Worth, a consummate actress of the English stage celebrated for her performances in the widest diversity of classical and contemporary roles from Shakespeare to Samuel Beckett and including Chekhov, Ibsen, Shaw and Edward Albee, died on Sunday in New York.","Irene Worth, a consummate actress of the English stage celebrated for her performances in the widest diversity of classical and contemporary roles from Shakespeare to Samuel Beckett and including Chekhov, Ibsen, Shaw and Edward Albee, died on Sunday in New York. She was 85, according to ""Who's Who in the Theater,"" but her sister, Carol Johnson of Santa Monica, Calif., said she was 86. Ms. Worth suffered a stroke at a post office near her apartment on the West Side of Manhattan and was rushed to a hospital, said Ms. Johnson, who was called by the hospital and flew to New York. Ms. Worth (whose first name was pronounced eye-REENY) won three Tony awards for her roles on Broadway, as best actress as Miss Alice in Mr. Albee's ""Tiny Alice"" in 1965 and as Alexandra del Lago in a revival of Tennessee Williams's ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" in 1976 and as best featured actress as Grandma Kurnitz in Neil Simon's ""Lost in Yonkers"" in 1991. Fiercely independent and articulate, Ms. Worth created a career that was daring as well as highly individual, and it was filled with memorable moments. She earned the highest praise as Celia in the premiere of ""The Cocktail Party"" by T. S. Eliot, as Arkadina in ""The Seagull,"" as Hedda Gabler and as Goneril to Paul Scofield's King Lear in Peter Brook's production, repeating her role in the Brook film. At other points in her career, she played Rosalind, Portia, Desdemona, Lady Macbeth, Volumnia and many others. With equal agility, she played heroines and villainesses -- and women with various shadings in between. In her virtuosity she became a complete actress, an artist in tune with her time -- and with other times as well. She was as much at home in gowns (and crowns) as she was in contemporary clothes. Was there any great role that she missed? At one time, she and Joseph Papp spoke about the possibility of her playing King Lear. She was, he said, one of the few American actors with the depth and power for that role. In the end, however, she restricted herself to playing female roles, seeking out the most complex characters in dramatic literature. With a boldness unmatched by many of her acting contemporaries, she continually challenged herself in plays by modern writers like Beckett, Mr. Albee, Williams and David Hare. She had a long artistic relationship with Mr. Brook, starring opposite John Gielgud in Mr. Brook's production of Seneca's ""Oedipus"" and traveling with the director and his ensemble to Iran with ""Orghast."" As Mr. Brook said, ""Having mastered with dazzling authority all the facets of her art, she joined us with the total commitment she always brought to her work."" Also active in the commercial theater, she starred in Lillian Hellman's ""Toys in the Attic,"" Mr. Simon's ""Lost in Yonkers"" and Noel Coward's ""Suite in Three Keys."" She combined an eloquent voice, which could rise from a purr to a cry of passion, with a striking physical presence. On stage and off, she had an elegance that made her a natural for playing queens, which she frequently did. Her beauty was untarnished (and unvarnished), even late in her life, and she also retained her sense of style and on occasion was featured in fashion articles. Highly literate, she was a self-educated theatrical scholar. She often appeared in literary evenings, drawn from the work of writers like Turgenev, Edith Wharton, Virginia Woolf, Edith Sitwell and George Sand, and she frequently created and performed evenings of poetry. In fact, she did so many solo performances that it was suggested that she preferred to act alone on stage, but that was not so, as Gielgud, Guinness and so many other actors could testify. Last year she and Mr. Scofield appeared in London in Carol Rocamora's play ""I Take Your Hand in Mine,"" based on the love letters of Chekhov and his wife, Olga Knipper. Her career, which spanned almost 60 years, was filled with honors (Tonys, Obies, Evening Standard awards as well as an honorary commander of the British Empire) and love letters from admiring critics and fellow actors. As Gielgud wrote forthrightly in one of his books, ""She is a great artist as well as one of my most devoted friends."" In the great artistic tradition, Ms. Worth invented herself. Born Harriet Abrams in Lincoln, Neb., she moved to California at an early age. Her sister said her name was changed at the suggestion of a Hollywood producer. After graduating from the University of California at Los Angeles, she was briefly a schoolteacher and then came to New York. In 1942 she auditioned for Elisabeth Bergner and toured with her in ""Escape Me Never."" The next year she made her Broadway debut with Ms. Bergner in the thriller ""The Two Mrs. Carrolls."" At Ms. Bergner's suggestion she then went to London where she studied with Elsie Fogerty, who taught her to speak ""stage English,"" as if to-the-manner -- and manor -- born. She was soon acting on the London stage in ""The Play's the Thing"" by Ferenc Molnar and then acted so frequently with the Old Vic and the Royal Shakespeare Company (and later the National Theater) that theatergoers assumed she was English rather than American. In 1950 she returned to Broadway with Alec Guinness in ""The Cocktail Party."" In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said that as ""the other woman,"" she gave ""a remarkably skillful, passionate and perceptive performance."" This was her breakthrough performance. Looking back on it, she said, ""The role of Celia was just right for me at the time -- vulnerable, idealistic, dedicated, easily disillusioned."" In 1953 she was a founding member of the Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Ontario, appearing opposite Guinness as Helena in ""All's Well That Ends Well."" In his review, Mr. Atkinson said that Ms. Worth ""gives another superb performance that overflows with loveliness, devotion, ceremony and modest guile."" From then on, she split her career between London and New York, while also performing in Canada and, later, making her adventurous journeys with Mr. Brook. In 1957 she joined the Phoenix Theater in New York, playing the title role in Schiller's ""Mary Stuart"" opposite Eva Le Gallienne as Queen Elizabeth. Throughout her career she and Gielgud remained colleagues and close friends. In 1964 they starred in ""Tiny Alice,"" Ms. Worth as the mysterious benefactor Miss Alice, Gielgud as the innocent lay brother Julian. In a highly dramatic seduction scene, Ms. Worth was supposed to open her beautiful Mainbocher gown and, seemingly naked, embrace Gielgud. By his own admission, he was embarrassed. In a moment of panic, she said to him, ""Oh, John, just imagine you and I suddenly got married."" Once when he was asked about the scene, Gielgud said, ""I say to myself, thank God, it's just dear old Irene."" It was with Mr. Brook as director that she and Gielgud triumphed in Seneca's ""Oedipus"" in London in 1968. Gielgud was Oedipus and Ms. Worth was Jocasta, who ends the play impaled on a golden spike. This was, in Ms. Worth's"
57951,"Laurence A. Tisch, Investor Known for Saving CBS Inc. From Takeover, Dies at 80","Laurence A. Tisch, the self-made New York billionaire who was hailed as a white knight for saving CBS Inc. from a hostile takeover and then reviled for diminishing what was once the nation's premier broadcasting network, died early yesterday at Tisch Hospital of the New York University Medical Center.","Laurence A. Tisch, the self-made New York billionaire who was hailed as a white knight for saving CBS Inc. from a hostile takeover and then reviled for diminishing what was once the nation's premier broadcasting network, died early yesterday at Tisch Hospital of the New York University Medical Center. He was 80. The cause was complications from gastric cancer, said his wife, Wilma, who is known as Billie. For much of his career, Mr. Tisch was known as a brilliant, contrarian investor who bought failing companies when their share prices were at low ebb and then turned them into profitable enterprises with much higher stock valuations. He and his brother, Preston Robert -- they were better known as Larry and Bob -- built up and controlled the Loews Corporation, a conglomerate of hotels, insurance, cigarette manufacturing, movie theaters, oil tankers and watchmaking that also was a vehicle for other investments. ""Larry is a brilliant financial analyst who doesn't let himself get misled by current fads, or, indeed by the crisis of the moment,"" said Martin Lipton, a corporate lawyer in a 1986 article on Mr. Tisch in The New York Times Magazine. ""Instead, he focuses on long-term outlooks and long-term values."" At that point, Mr. Tisch had a sterling reputation not only for his Midas touch, but also as a man who disdained the glitz and arrogance that so many other magnates embraced in the 1980's. He spent his leisure time with his family, in frequent discussions of Jewish traditions with Talmudic scholars, on the boards of leading cultural institutions in New York City and as a philanthropist. He was known as a political centrist who was the host of breakfasts for such opposites as Representative Charles B. Rangel, a liberal Democrat from Harlem, and the Rev. Pat Robertson, a television evangelist and conservative Republican from Virginia. ""Larry Tisch made an enormous contribution to the city, and he will be sorely missed. He represented what is best about New York, and his generosity will leave a legacy that we will all try to build on,"" said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in a statement. His credentials made Mr. Tisch the consensus candidate in 1986 to rescue CBS from an assortment of corporate raiders and from conservative politicians, led by Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, who accused the network of a liberal bias. Through Loews, Mr. Tisch bought a strong minority stake in CBS and was invited to join its board. Shortly, he was elevated to acting chairman and chief executive. ""My only desire is to keep CBS as a first-class, independent network,"" he told The Times Magazine. ""It's very important for the country."" But Mr. Tisch was soon blamed for selling off some of CBS's most valuable assets, failing to develop top-rated programs, dismissing too many employees and leaving the company far behind its main competitors in terms of audience and advertising revenues. Mr. Tisch defended his 10-year leadership of CBS by noting that its sale in 1995 to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation brought a windfall of profits to shareholders, including Loews, his family-controlled company, which ended up $1 billion richer. But a legion of critics faulted Mr. Tisch's performance. ""Is that the legacy he wants to leave, that he made a lot of money?"" Gerard R. Roche, an executive recruiter who often placed managers at the company, asked at the time. ""CBS is a disaster."" Media spokesmen were even more scathing. ""He took an institution that was important in this country, and he strangled it,"" said Alex S. Jones, host of ""On the Media,"" a public radio program, in a 1995 interview in The Times. In the years after the sale of CBS, Mr. Tisch became increasingly involved in philanthropic efforts, especially on behalf of his alma mater, New York University. He also served as chairman of the university's board of trustees from 1978 to 1998 and helped raise almost $2 billion for the university, including more than $40 million from his own family's donations. But his sure financial instincts seemed to have abandoned him. Between 1996 and 2000, he lost about $2 billion of Loews' capital by betting heavily against the rising stock market. Laurence Alan Tisch was born on March 5, 1923, in Brooklyn. His father, Al Tisch, a former All-American basketball player at the City University of New York, owned a garment factory and two summer camps that his wife, Sadye, helped him run. Laurence graduated cum laude from New York University at 18, and a year later earned a master's degree in industrial management from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After World War II service in the Office of Strategic Services, the intelligence agency that was the precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency, he enrolled at Harvard Law School, but dropped out after a year. Brothers in Business In 1946, Mr. Tisch's parents entrusted him with $125,000 to invest. He used the money to buy a lackluster New Jersey resort hotel that he found listed in the Business Opportunities section of The Times. His brother, Bob, joined him as a full partner in 1948, and over the next dozen years, the brothers acquired a dozen hotels in New York, New Jersey and Florida. There was a natural division of labor between the two siblings: Larry plotted overall financial strategy while Bob concentrated on management. In 1960, the brothers gained control of Loews, one of the larger movie-house chains in the country. What attracted Mr. Tisch to the company were its underlying real estate assets -- a business concept that many investors tended to overlook at the time. In 1961, the Tisch brothers knocked down the old Loews Lexington Theater and used the site to build the 800-room Summit Hotel. Several other unprofitable New York movie theaters in the Loews chain gave way to modern apartment buildings and a number of hotels, including the 50-story, 2,000-room Americana, which became the city's largest hotel when it opened in 1962. Mr. Tisch was just getting started. In 1968, he bought Lorillard, then the fifth-largest cigarette company in the United States. He shed its nontobacco interests to increase profit margins. In 1974, he acquired a controlling stake in the CAN Financial Corporation, a nearly bankrupt Chicago-based insurance company. Within a few years he transformed it into a company with $16.5 billion in assets and an A-plus credit rating. By 1980, Loews vaulted to more than $3 billion in annual revenues -- in contrast to $100 million a decade earlier -- from its 14 hotels, 67 movie theaters, insurance operations, shipping, Bulova watches, and popular cigarette brands including Kent, Newport and True. Typical of Mr. Tisch's financial strategy was a decision to buy five supertankers for $25 million in the early 1980's when the oil market was depressed. The investment had no risk because even if oil prices did not rise, the scrap value of each tanker was worth $5 million. Mr. Tisch did occasionally stumble. In 1971, Loews invested $40 million in the Franklin National Bank, which was sold to Michele Sindona, an Italian financier. The bank failed, and Mr. Sindona was convicted of looting its assets. Loews was sued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for breach of fiduciary duty and misuse of inside information. The company agreed to pay$1.2 million in an out-of-court settlement. Even as his fortune and reputation rose, Mr. Tisch's style of living remained little changed. He and his wife, the former Billie Stein, whom he married in 1948, lived in an unpretentious Fifth Avenue apartment. They spent weekends in a home in Rye, N.Y., close to properties owned by their four sons, Andrew, Dan, James and Tom. At one point, all but Tom worked with their father in his Fifth Avenue office, with ""spare furnishings and beige industrial carpeting reminiscent of a Howard Johnson's motor inn,"" according to a 1986 article in The Times Magazine. Surrounded by his sons, Mr. Tisch often invited a rabbi to his headquarters to discuss Bible passages and Talmudic interpretations. For relaxation at night, he played bridge, and on weekends, he played tennis with close friends and fellow investors. Fighting Off Takeover Bid This orderly, well-rounded and lucrative existence made a great change of direction because Mr. Tisch became drawn into a battle for control of CBS. In 1985, Ted Turner, the cable television entrepreneur, tried unsuccessfully to acquire CBS with a package of high-risk securities. Marvin Davis, a wealthy oilman and former owner of the 20th Century Fox film company, and Ivan F. Boesky, the stock speculator who later was convicted on insider-trading charges, also made takeover bids for the broadcast network. Meanwhile, Senator Helms was urging a politically conservative investment group to buy CBS and become ""Dan Rather's boss"" to end what the senator perceived as a liberal tone to the network's newscasts. To discourage a hostile takeover, CBS invited Mr. Tisch to play the role of a white knight and invest in the company. By mid-1986, Mr. Tisch, using Loews as his investment vehicle, acquired almost 25 percent of CBS for $750 million. ""We invited Mr. Tisch and Loews to take on a substantial share of the company because we felt having that kind of long-haul commitment from a person like him was in the interest of our shareholders and the country,"" William Lilley III, a CBS senior vice president, told Newsday at the time. Mr. Tisch joined the CBS board and soon locked horns with Thomas H. Wyman, the chairman and chief executive, over the latter's attempt to sell the network to the Coca-Cola Company without even informing the board of those negotiations. At a board meeting, Mr. Tisch argued that such a transaction would be a betrayal of shareholders because CBS stock was so undervalued, and he then challenged Mr. Wyman's authority to offer the company to potential suitors. Mr. Wyman resigned the next day. Mr. Tisch became acting chief executive, while William S. Paley, the legendary founder of CBS, came out of retirement to take up the post of acting chairman. Soon afterward, Van Gordon Sauter, the president of CBS News, also stepped down after being accused by Mr. Tisch of favoring audience ratings over quality in the news division. ""Whether the news loses money or makes money is secondary to what we put on the air,"" Mr. Tisch told The Times in 1986. And in a 1986 interview in The Wall Street Journal, he promised that the news division would ""get total support from me in every way -- financially, morally."" But within months, Mr. Tisch presided over the ouster of 230 out of 1,200 news employees and a $30 million reduction in the news division's budget -- ""the biggest single staff and budget cut in network news history,"" according to Business Week. Mr. Tisch then sold CBS's book publishing units to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1986 for $500 million and CBS's magazines to Diamandis Communications for $650 million the next year. Also in 1987, he sold CBS Records -- the second-largest record company in the world at the time -- to the Sony Corporation of Japan for $2 billion. But Mr. Tisch was soon criticized within the industry and on Wall Street for not using this cash pile of more than $3 billion to diversify CBS. At CBS affiliate stations, some executives openly called for Mr. Tisch to relinquish his post of chief executive to someone with more experience in broadcasting. ""I heard your concerns and disappointments loud and clear,"" Mr. Tisch told representatives of affiliate stations at a 1988 meeting, Forbes magazine reported. ""I share your dissatisfactions."" After many years as the predominant network, CBS became mired in third place behind NBC and ABC in audience ratings and advertising revenues, and even trailed Rupert Murdoch's upstart Fox network in the 18-to-49 age group that is crucial to advertisers. While CBS briefly climbed back to the top ranking in 1993, it eventually fell again. After a decade at the helm, Mr. Tisch decided the time had come to sell CBS, the last remaining independent network. Selling the Network In 1995, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation agreed to pay $5.4 billion for CBS. Mr. Tisch pointed out that under his leadership, CBS stock had climbed at an annual rate of almost 15 percent. But critics asserted that the CBS share prices might have risen far more if the company had been managed for growth. As evidence, they pointed to the almost simultaneous sale of Capital Cities/ABC to the Walt Disney Company for $19 billion -- 3.5 times the price for CBS. A decade before, ABC's market value was $3.5 billion, compared with $2.8 billion for CBS. Even close friends of Mr. Tisch publicly faulted him for not understanding the broadcast business. John H. Gutfreund, the former chairman of Salomon Inc., contrasted him with Mr. Paley, the founder of CBS. ""Bill had a vision for the industry,"" Mr. Gutfreund told The Times in 1995. ""For Larry, it is a business."" In the years after he left CBS, Mr. Tisch appeared in the business press mainly because of his bearish positions on a stock market that rose throughout the 1990's. Betting steadily against the market, Mr. Tisch recorded some $2 billion in trading losses for Loews. Increasingly, he devoted himself to civic affairs and philanthropy. Over the years, he was a trustee of the Whitney Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Public Library. He was also president of the United Jewish Appeal of New York and a director of the Legal Aid Society. He became a prolific fund-raiser for N.Y.U., helping to provide it with endowment and buildings. In addition to his wife, four sons and brother, Mr. Tisch is survived by fifteen grandchildren. Despite being a billionaire, Mr. Tisch continued his restrained style of living. ""Your standard of living doesn't change after the first million,"" he once said. ""I don't want to become possessed by my possessions."""
17256,"Amir Pnueli, 68, Pioneer of Temporal Logic","Amir Pnueli, who turned a philosopher's explorations of time, logic and free will into a critical technique for verifying the reliability of computers, died on Nov. 2 in Manhattan.","Amir Pnueli, who turned a philosopher's explorations of time, logic and free will into a critical technique for verifying the reliability of computers, died on Nov. 2 in Manhattan. He was 68. The cause of death was a brain hemorrhage, according to New York University, where Dr. Pnueli (pronounced p'new-EL-ee) was a professor of computer science. In their first few decades, computers were essentially glorified calculators. Numbers were fed in, and after some calculating the answers came out. By the 1970s, programmers knew how to verify that the programs were performing such calculations correctly. But as computers became more powerful and software more sophisticated -- juggling multiple tasks and responding to changing data -- verification grew harder. Programmers had to take into account the behavior of the system over time as it responded to new data or instructions while calculating. In researching the problem, Dr. Pnueli, then at Tel Aviv University, came across the work of the philosopher Arthur Prior, who had developed ''tense logic'' to evaluate statements whose truthfulness changes over time. Take the statement ''I am tired,'' for example. While its meaning does not change, it is sometimes true and sometimes less so, and a person acts differently depending on the extent of tiredness -- going to bed versus going on a hike. In much the same way, a computer's actions must often adjust to circumstances. If the hard disk is busy reading data for another process, then a command to write data to the hard disk must wait. ''What Pnueli realized is this logic is actually a perfect fit for computer science,'' said Moshe Y. Vardi, a professor of computational engineering at Rice University. Dr. Pnueli's findings on using Prior's concepts (now more commonly known as temporal logic) in computer systems appeared in a landmark 1977 paper, ''The Temporal Logic of Programs.'' In 1996, Dr. Pnueli received the A. M. Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery, an honor often called computer science's equivalent of the Nobel Prize. The award citation said his 1977 paper ''triggered a fundamental paradigm shift in reasoning about the dynamic behavior of systems.'' Chip makers now use software employing temporal logic to verify that the millions of transistors are calculating as designed, and programmers use temporal logic to minimize the number of bugs in their software. ''All these things are the result of Amir Pnueli's work over 30 years ago,'' Dr. Vardi said. Amir Pnueli was born on April 22, 1941, at Nahalal, in what is now Israel. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and a doctorate in applied mathematics from the Weizmann Institute of Science, writing a thesis on the calculation of ocean tides. He switched to computer science as a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford and then moved to positions at the Watson Research Center of I.B.M. in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and at Weizmann. He founded the computer science department at Tel Aviv University in 1973 and served as its first chairman. In 1981 he returned to Weizmann as a professor of computer science. He joined the computer science department at N.Y.U. in 1999. Dr. Pnueli also founded two software companies, Mini-Systems in 1971 and AdCad in 1984. His awards include the Israel Prize, the highest honor given by the State of Israel, and membership as a foreign associate in the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Pnueli is survived by his wife, Ariela; two daughters, Shira Pnueli-Levi of Nes Ziona, Israel, and Noga Pnueli of Brooklyn; a son, Ishay, of Hod Hasharon, Israel; and four grandchildren."

BLANDING, VASSAR'S 6TH CHIEF","Sarah Gibson Blanding, the first female president of Vassar College, died yesterday at a retirement home in Newtown, Pa., where she had lived since 1980.","Sarah Gibson Blanding, the first female president of Vassar College, died yesterday at a retirement home in Newtown, Pa., where she had lived since 1980. She was 86 years old. Miss Blanding, the sixth president of Vassar, led the college from 1946 to 1964. She made major changes in the school's curriculum, emphasizing independent work, and oversaw significant growth in the investment portfolio of the college, which was founded in 1861 in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She also pioneered basic research into the psychological changes of students during their college years. While she was fundamentally concerned with the education of women and their role in society, in 1961 she accurately forecast the gradual disappearance of women's colleges in this country. Vassar began admitting men in 1969. Miss Blanding was a vigorous and vocal exponent for women. ''I have never been conscious of obstacles raised because I am a woman,'' she said in one of her first interviews as president. ''I have no patience with women who are always talking about 'a man's world,' because they are the ones who make it so.'' Born on a Farm Miss Blanding was born in 1898 on a small farm near Lexington, Ky., to an internal revenue officer and his wife. She attended the New Haven (Conn.) Normal School of Gymnastics and upon graduating agreed to teach at the University of Kentucky, on the condition that she could attend classes in the mornings and leave teaching to the afternoons. After she graduated in 1923, she remained at the university as acting dean of women. At 24, she was the youngest person in the country to hold such a post. She earned a master's degree at Columbia University in 1926 and studied at the London School of Economics, under Harold Laski, who later became Deputy Prime Minister to Winston Churchill. In 1928, she returned to the University of Kentucky, serving as dean of women and teaching political science. In 1941, she became dean of the New York State College of Home Economics at Cornell University, where she remained until Vassar asked her to assume its presidency. At her retirement in 1964, the Vassar faculty presented her with a tractor, evoking both the practical effects of her tenure and her Kentucky childhood. Miss Blanding is survived by ''a few distant relatives in Kentucky,'' according to a Vassar spokesman, Dixie Sheridan. Miss Blanding asked that there be no funeral or memorial service."
20445,Olivier Is Dead After 6-Decade Acting Career,"Laurence Olivier, hailed as one of the greatest classical stage actors of his time, died yesterday at his home near London.","Laurence Olivier, hailed as one of the greatest classical stage actors of his time, died yesterday at his home near London. He was 82 years old. Lord Olivier died ''peacefully in his sleep,'' surrounded by friends and relatives, in Steyning, West Sussex, said his agent, Laurence Evans. He was hospitalized several times in the last year after a kidney operation. His last professional appearance was a cameo role in the 1988 movie ''War Requiem,'' based on the oratorio by Benjamin Britten. Virtuosity and Daring Lord Olivier was a performer of astonishing virtuosity and daring. If that were not enough to fill a career, he was also a movie star of the first magnitude, a film director whose Shakespearean adaptations are unmatched on the screen, a stage director with a breadth of accomplishment in contemporary as well as classic plays and the founder and first artistic director of the National Theater of Britain. Knighted in 1947, raised to life peerage in 1970, he was, in art as well as title, a princely lord of his profession. Although his achievements and influences were many and varied, he was primarily an actor, and in a six-decade career onstage and in films, his performances - as Henry V, Hamlet, Richard III, Oedipus, Othello, Archie Rice in ''The Entertainer,'' Heathcliff in ''Wuthering Heights'' and Maxim De Winter in ''Rebecca'' - won him artistic immortality. He played kings, villains and, occasionally, clowns, the most challenging roles in the classical repertory, and also some of the most popular romantic figures. And in the last decade of his life, he had still another, profitable career as a character actor in Hollywood movies. Though he retired from the stage in 1974 because of illness, he never stopped working as a serious actor. Paralleling his renewed Hollywood reknown, he acted on television - as Lord Marchmain in ''Brideshead Revisited,'' as the barrister in John Mortimer's ''Voyage Round My Father,'' as the artist Henry Breasley in John Fowles's ''Ebony Tower,'' and, for the second time in his career, as a thunderous ''King Lear.'' Lord Olivier, Sir John Gielgud and the late Sir Ralph Richardson were ranked as the three most eminent knights of the English theater. All were rivals, and Sir Ralph remained one of Lord Olivier's closest friends and a frequent adviser. One could elevate Sir John for his poetic bearing and voice and Sir Ralph for his gift for eccentric characterizations, but neither they nor any of their contemporaries could match Lord Olivier in matters of boldness and bravery. Sir John admired the way Lord Olivier ''dashes with a part'' and ''wrings its neck.'' ''He doesn't act with the sort of caution and fear that some of the rest of us have,'' he said. Throughout his career, Lord Olivier was known for his feats of physical as well as emotional courage. In his film ''Hamlet,'' he leaped from a 15-foot platform to catch the conscience of Claudius. In Strindberg's ''Dance of Death,'' he fell to the floor in a faint with such conviction that audiences thought he had a stroke onstage. He was not often given to public introspection about the art of acting, but in his 1982 autobiography, ''Confessions of an Actor'' (Penguin; Simon & Schuster), he wrote that to be a successful actor one needed ''an equal trinity of contributing qualities: talent, luck and stamina.'' In conversation, he stressed that of the three, stamina, ''actual physical strength,'' was the most important of all. He could have added that it also took determination. Though in hindsight, Lord Olivier was accepted as a natural actor, to a large extent he willed himself to his position of greatness. He learned how to use his voice and body in the interest of his art, perfecting accents, experimenting with makeup and challenging himself in his choice of roles. But in films he came to be regarded as a quintessential romantic hero - his Heathcliff still makes hearts beat faster - even his looks were, to a certain extent, a tribute to the persuasiveness of his performance. ''He has never been a particularly handsome man,'' Sir Tyrone Guthrie wrote, ''but he has always been able, on the stage, to suggest extreme good looks.'' 'A Tragedian by Art' Not to be underestimated was his gift for comedy, as Sir Toby Belch in ''Twelfth Night'' and also in ''Richard III,'' in which he found the comedy beneath the tragedy. As the critic James Agate wrote, Lord Olivier was ''a comedian by instinct and a tragedian by art.'' And Sir Alec Guinness, known for his own comic talent, said, ''Olivier has made me laugh more as an actor'' - in eccentric comic parts - ''than anyone else.'' In 1945, he combined the sublime and the ridiculous on a single bill: after his famous eye-gouging performance in ''Oedipus'' he offered a cameo as Mr. Puff in Sheridan's ''Critic,'' an evening commonly referred to as ''Oedipuff.'' Although others would credit him for his honesty (Noel Coward emphasized the ''impeccable truth'' of his characterizations), he confessed that for him acting was a form of lying. Other actors spoke of their need to express themselves, but he said he was not conscious of any need other ''than to show off.'' Onstage he could project supreme self-confidence, but in private he was tormented by doubt and guilt, both of which he traced back to his boyhood, which was the beginning of a life lived in the imagination. Laurence Kerr Olivier was born in Dorking, Surrey, on May 22, 1907. His mother, Agnes Crookenden Olivier, died when he was 12 years old. He and his older brother and sister were brought up by their father, Gerard Olivier, an Anglican clergyman, schoolmaster, strict disciplinarian and, in his son's"

Combe, who was responsible for the fame of a medicine chest of brand-name products including Clearasil and Just for Men hair coloring, died on Tuesday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 88. Mr. Combe, who lived in Greenwich, was the chairman and chief executive of Combe Inc., a privately held company he founded in 1948. His first marketing coup was Clearasil, an over-the-counter acne remedy that he and a chemist developed in the early 1950's after market research with teenagers. After it became one of the first advertisers on Dick Clark's television show ""American Bandstand,"" the product was a runaway success. Mr. Combe sold Clearasil to Vick Chemical in 1960, and shortly afterward he acquired a little-known company called Grecian Formula 16, a gradual hair-coloring product for men. Through advertising and marketing, he turned it into an almost iconic brand. Later in the 1960's, he acquired Lanacane, an itch-relieving cream, and through energetic advertising he expanded the market for such products. During the next 30 years, he created or built market niches for products like Odor-Eaters foot care products, Vagisil feminine care products and Just for Men instant hair coloring. ""He was an idea guy -- he just came up with these product categories and made the products a household word,"" said E. Edward Kavanaugh, president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association. Ivan DeBlois Combe was born in Fremont, Iowa, on April 21, 1911. He earned a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University and attended Northwestern Law School. He then became a salesman for Hydrox Ice Cream and Wilbur Shoe Polish before moving to New York to work for the Young & Rubicam advertising agency. Mr. Combe later joined Pharmacraft, a drug manufacturer, but in 1949, at 38 years old, he left his position as vice president for marketing to create his own company. Mr. Combe served as chairman of the Proprietary Association, which was later known as the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association and subsequently the Consumer Healthcare Products Association. He was also chairman of the World Federation of Proprietary Medicine Manufacturers, now called the World Self-Medication Industry. He is survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth; two daughters, Diana Bickford, of Dorset, Vt., and Juliette Larson, of Douglaston, Queens; his son, Christopher Combe, of Greenwich; and seven grandchildren. http://www.nytimes.com"
19534,C. G. Fabricant Dies at 81; Pushed Heart Illness Theory,"Catherine G. Fabricant, an early proponent of the theory that herpes infections can lay the groundwork for a common form of heart disease, died Sept. 13 at a nursing home in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 81.","Catherine G. Fabricant, an early proponent of the theory that herpes infections can lay the groundwork for a common form of heart disease, died Sept. 13 at a nursing home in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 81. The cause of death was kidney failure, her family said. The theory that some strains of herpes, as well as other viruses, play a role in atherosclerosis -- the life-threatening condition in which the arteries clog with plaque, reducing blood flow -- has not been confirmed. But several studies have lent support to it, and it is the focus of many current research projects. ""It is clearly a hot area right now,"" said Dr. Sidney C. Smith, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the chief science officer for the American Heart Association. The notion received a cooler response in the late 1970's, when Mrs. Fabricant, a researcher at Cornell University, began making a case for it along with a few other scientists. Mrs. Fabricant had several strikes against her. She was a woman, still a rarity among researchers at the time; she had never quite finished her doctorate (she put it aside to raise her children); and when she published her first findings, the wisdom taking hold was that atherosclerosis was simply the result of high cholesterol. It probably did not help that she did her work not in the field of human sciences but at Cornell's veterinary school. ""People with little or no knowledge of virology did not want to give up pet theories,"" she said in a Cornell newsletter in 1997. ""Especially not to a veterinary medical researcher, and especially not to a woman."" Although she was not the first researcher to suggest a link between infection and blocked arteries -- the theory was first proposed in the early 20th century -- she was among the first to provide evidence for it in the lab. Mrs. Fabricant's interest began in the late 1960's, associates said, when she discovered that a herpes virus was linked to urinary obstruction in cats. She later determined that the blockage was formed by cholesterol and, aware of cholesterol's role in heart disease, wondered if herpes was playing a role in that disease. Herpes takes many forms, infecting large numbers of people but often causing no discernible health problems. In the 1970's, working with her husband, Dr. Julius Fabricant, a microbiologist and bird disease expert at Cornell, Mrs. Fabricant began using chickens to test her theory. She infected one group with an avian herpes virus, while giving an uninfected group a diet high in cholesterol. Within a year, she reported, she had found clear evidence of a herpes link. The chickens that were infected had a much higher rate of lesions in their heart arteries, and the lesions resembled those seen in human heart disease, she said. Later studies by others found that cytomegalovirus, a herpes-related virus, is found in the fatty plaque of heart disease patients. Other studies have found similar links. Even if herpes is definitively established as a factor in heart disease, experts say, it would not mean that cholesterol levels play no role or that people should stop paying attention to their diets. Among the infected chickens Mrs. Fabricant studied, those given high-cholesterol diets had more blockages. Many experts believe that heart disease results from a complex interplay among infection, inherited traits, diet and other factors. Catherine Grenci Fabricant was born Sept. 24, 1919, in Davoli, Italy. Her family moved soon after to Rochester, where she grew up. In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Barbara L. Fabricant of New Albany, Ind.; a son, Daniel, of Melrose, Mass.; and two sisters, Carmella Arico of Rochester and Sue Ciulla of Phoenix. Mrs. Fabricant retired about 15 years ago, and she never achieved an academic rank higher than acting assistant professor. But many of her peers did not realize this. ""When we went to meetings,"" her husband recalled, ""practically everybody called her 'doctor' because, I guess, they assumed that nobody else could have done that sort of thing."""
54237,"Stewart R. Mott, Longtime Patron of Liberal and Offbeat Causes, Dies at 70","Stewart R. Mott, a philanthropist whose gifts to progressive and sometimes offbeat causes were often upstaged by his eccentricities, like cultivating a large garden atop his Manhattan penthouse, complete with 460 plant species (including 17 types of radishes) and a chicken coop, died on Thursday night.","Stewart R. Mott, a philanthropist whose gifts to progressive and sometimes offbeat causes were often upstaged by his eccentricities, like cultivating a large garden atop his Manhattan penthouse, complete with 460 plant species (including 17 types of radishes) and a chicken coop, died on Thursday night. He was 70 and had homes in North Salem, N.Y., and Bermuda. His death was confirmed on Friday by Conrad Martin, executive director of the Stewart R. Mott Charitable Trust in Washington. He said that Mr. Mott had been ill with cancer for some time and that he died at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mr. Mott's philanthropy went toward causes like birth control, abortion rights, sex research, arms control, feminism, civil liberties, governmental reform, gay rights and research on extrasensory perception. His political giving, often directed against incumbent presidents, was the most visible. In 1968, he heavily bankrolled Senator Eugene J. McCarthy's bid for president. Four years later, he was the biggest contributor to Senator George S. McGovern, the Democratic presidential nominee. When Charles W. Colson, the White House chief counsel to President Richard M. Nixon, included Mr. Mott on Nixon's ''enemies list,'' Mr. Colson noted, ''nothing but big money for radic-lib candidates.'' In 1974, an amended campaign finance law barred the sort of large political gifts in which Mr. Mott specialized, prompting him to join conservatives to fight it as an abridgement of free expression. They argued that limits on contributions given independently of a candidate's organization were unconstitutional. In 1976, the Supreme Court agreed with them, while keeping other parts of the law. Mr. Mott then devised ways to give to candidates under the new rules. Following conservatives' precedents, he formed political action committees and mastered direct mail as methods of collecting small donations in great numbers. Still, his ability to help the independent presidential candidacy of Representative John B. Anderson of Illinois in 1980 was curbed; gone were the days when he could simply write a big check and hand it to a candidate. Some argued that the financing restrictions diminished the chances that candidates could emerge from the grass roots and be propelled to national prominence by well-placed benefactors. Bradley A. Smith, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, wrote in The Yale Law Journal in 1996 that Mr. Anderson's losing independent bid might have fared better had Mr. Mott not been so effectively leashed. Irreverent, good-looking and effusive, Mr. Mott seemed tailor-made for the 1960s and '70s, when he attracted his widest attention, not least for his candid comments about everything from his sex partners (full names provided ) to his father's parental deficiencies (''a zookeeper'') to his blood type (AB positive). He once lived on a Chinese junk in the Hudson River as a self-described beatnik and kept notes to himself on Turkish cigarette boxes, accumulating thousands. He held folk music festivals to promote peace and love. The garden at his Manhattan penthouse (which he sold some years ago) was famous; at one point Mr. Mott taught a course in city gardening at the New School. He told an interviewer that he lay awake wondering how to grow a better radish. Mr. Mott seemed to relish poking his finger in the eye of General Motors, a company that his father, Charles Stewart Mott, helped shape as an early high-ranking executive. In the '60s, the younger Mr. Mott drove a battered red Volkswagen with yellow flower decals when he drove at all. He criticized G.M. at its annual meeting for not speaking out against the Vietnam War. He gave money to a neighborhood group opposing a new G.M. plant because it would involve razing 1,500 homes. Mr. Mott broke into politics in 1968, hoping to encourage Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York to run for president. In newspaper advertisements, Mr. Mott pledged $50,000 to seed a Rockefeller campaign if others would contribute double that amount. But Mr. Rockefeller rejected his efforts, and later Mr. Mott turned to Mr. McCarthy. (Mr. Rockefeller eventually did run, unsuccessfully, for the 1968 Republican nomination.) In 1972, Mr. Mott ran what some regarded as a scurrilous ad campaign against Senator Edmund S. Muskie, a rival of Mr. McGovern's in his own Democratic Party. This led to Mr. Mott's being called before the Senate Watergate Committee, which was investigating political dirty tricks. It found that he had done nothing wrong. Mr. Mott also took an interest in military oversight, financing the Project on Military Procurement, a watchdog group, and the Center for Defense Information, among other research projects. In 1979, a report by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, said these activities added up to an ''anti-defense lobby.'' In 1974, Mr. Mott started the Fund for Constitutional Government to expose corruption in the federal government. The same year, he bought an early 19th-century house in Washington to house his various activities. At a 1982 soiree, he brought in an elephant and two donkeys, apparently to demonstrate political balance. Mr. Mott paid most of the early legal fees for a 1976 suit that ultimately caused former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew to repay money ($147,599 plus interest) that he had been accused of improperly receiving when he was governor of Maryland. Mr. Agnew, who had resigned the vice presidency after pleading no contest to a tax evasion charge, did not admit guilt. Mr. Mott officially told the election commission that his job was ''maverick.'' He listed himself as ''philanthropist'' in the Manhattan phone book. (Space limitations precluded his preferred ''avant-garde philanthropist.'') Stewart Rawlings Mott was born on Dec. 4, 1937, in Flint, Mich. He was the son of Charles Stewart Mott and the former Ruth Rawlings, Mr. Mott's fourth wife. They also had two daughters. (The elder Mr. Mott also had a son and two daughters with his first wife, the former Ethel Culbert Harding.) Charles Mott took over one of the family's businesses, manufacturing wheels and axles, and in 1906 moved the company from Utica, N.Y., to Flint, Mich., to take advantage of the auto industry's rapid growth. By 1913, he had sold the company to General Motors for G.M. stock, becoming G.M.'s largest individual shareholder. He established the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, a major philanthropy, in 1926 and died in 1973 at the age of 97. Stewart, the second child of his father's second wave of children, was born when his father was 62. The age gap, when combined with the father's standoffish manner, created a chasm. The father signed notes to his son, ''Very truly yours, C. S. Mott,'' and hired a coach to teach him to ride a bike. Stewart was overweight as a child and nearly drowned at 9 when he ventured out onto thin ice. After running away at 11, he struck a bargain with his father to come home and stay half the summer if he could work the other half at family enterprises. His experiences included a Flint department store, a pecan-and-goose farm in New Mexico and a refrigerator plant in France. He attended Michigan public and private schools until he was 13, then entered Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts, from which he graduated. He studied engineering for three years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then hitchhiked around the world for a year, spending just $1,500. He finished his education at Columbia, earningtwo bachelor's degrees, one in business administration and one in comparative literature, and a Phi Beta Kappa key. After his Chinese junk kept sinking, he abandoned it for terrestrial accommodations. He wrote a thesis on Sophocles for a never-completed Columbia master's degree in Greek drama. While pursuing his education, Mr. Mott worked as an apprentice in various family enterprises. In the academic year 1963-64, he taught English at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti. His philanthropy began when he returned to Flint and started a branch of Planned Parenthood. He then traveled the nation on behalf of Planned Parenthood. Newly enthusiastic about philanthropy, he asked to join his father's foundation, which served mainly Flint. His father said no, so Stewart used trust fund money to start his own charity. He moved to New York in 1966 and did not speak to his father for a year. He said in an interview in 1971 with The New Yorker: ''Right now, my philanthropy is hearty, robust, full-bodied, but it still needs a few years of aging before it will develop fully its eventual clarity, delicacy, elegancy, fruitiness and fragrance.'' In fact, it became more low-key, even as Mr. Mott pursued the same range of causes. On its Web site, the Stewart R. Mott Charitable Trust said it looks for projects ''seeking tangible change.'' For years, Mr. Mott was a bachelor well publicized for his eligibility. When The Washington Post reported that he had slept with 40 women over an eight-month period, he issued a correction, saying the number was actually 20. In 1979, he married Kappy Wells, a sculptor. They divorced in 1999. He is survived by a son, Sam, of Santa Fe, N.M., and a sister, Maryanne Mott, of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Montana. In 1969, Mr. Mott gave a huge party at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan to celebrate his father's 94th birthday. Earlier that day, the older man had accepted a ride in his son's Volkswagen. He said it was bumpy."

Saad Haddad, a former Lebanese Army officer who for years ran his own militia force in southern Lebanon with Israeli support, died at his home yesterday at the age of 47, Israeli officials in Tel Aviv reported. His family had said he was ill with cancer. The major died in his hometown of Merj 'Uyun with his wife, Theresa, and six daughters at his bedside, the Israeli state radio reported. Church bells rang in mourning in many villages in the area, it said. An adherent of the Greek Catholic rite, Major Haddad broke away from the Lebanese Army in 1976 and operated a loosely-knit militia force of about 1,500 Christian, and some Moslem, soldiers that received arms, money and training from Israel. He was formally dismissed from the Lebanese Army seven years ago but was reinstated earlier this month. The militia has garrisons in Christian and Shiite Moslem villages in parts of southern Lebanon and makes patrols in the area, but it is not impressive militarily, according to Western and Israeli analysts, and it has never became a real force in the region. Many local Shiite militiamen spurned the major's authority. Curbed Palestinian Infiltration Before Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Major Haddad's militia played an important role, in Israeli eyes, in curbing Palestinian guerrilla infiltration into northern Israel. But by early this year, United Nations and Israeli sources reported, the militia's significance for the Israelis lay chiefly in the system of informers that it maintained across southern Lebanon. The network, they said, kept the major and the Israelis well-informed about what was going on in the area, and helped to discourage Palestinians from trying further infiltrations. It was after the civil war fragmented Lebanon in 1975-76 that Major Haddad began operating his militia in an enclave along Lebanon's side of the Israeli-Lebanese border. He gave Israeli troops free use of the area for their artillery and for preparations to strike Palestine Liberation Organization emplacements. In addition, Israeli officials said, the major led raids against Palestinian guerrillas, who would fire rockets and artillery shells over his enclave into northern Israel. Received Training in U.S. A lean man with a wide smile, a broad mustache and a sometimes swaggering manner, Major Haddad kept his militia united, according to his admirers, by the force of his personality and he was warmly regarded by southern Lebanese civilians who shared his deep-seated hostility toward the Palestinian guerrillas. The major began his military career as a professional Lebanese Army officer and received a year's training at the advanced infantry school in Fort Benning, Ga. In 1968 he was wounded in the chest when the Lebanese Army clashed with P.L.O. guerrillas in Lebanon. Four years later he singled himself out, in Israeli eyes, when a contingent of Israeli commandos, pursuing Palestinian guerrillas, crossed into southern Lebanon for several days. One platoon got lost and came to a Lebanese Army post commanded by the wiry captain, as he then was. He reportedly gave the Israeli patrol supplies and told them how to get back to Israel. Israelis Left Him in Control It was four years later that the major finally broke from the Lebanese Army, and when Israeli forces withdrew after their three-month move into Lebanon in 1978, they left him - by then widely known as an opponent of the Palestinian guerrillas - and his men in control of a substantial area. The major expanded his force and came to claim that it was much larger than the 1,500 to 2,000 men it was generally reported to number. Israel helped by advising the militia as well as providing training, money, and equipment, including uniforms and captured Soviet-made artillery and United States-made Sherman tanks. Affer the 1978 Israeli incursion, the militia, with Israeli backing, expanded its area of operation westward from its earlier enclave. After the 1982 invasion, it spread northward and eastward, to the Mediterranean coast. In 1982 some survivors of the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut asserted that the major's forces had taken part. But Major Haddad denied the charges and an Israeli judicial inquiry later determined that his militiamen had not been involved. Israel Sought Role for Militia In early 1983 the Israelis wanted the Haddad militia integrated into the Lebanese Army and to have the major named commander of all Lebanese soldiers patrolling the Israeli border area. The Lebanese Government said it was agreeable to taking the major back into its army, along with his men, but that it would not let him be the ranking commander in the south. It was thought in Beirut that he would always be under Israeli influence. In May 1983 the major told an interviewer that he wanted recognition as the top commander of Lebanese security forces in south Lebanon ''because the people want it.'' ''I want to follow the will of the people because my country is still in danger,'' he said. ''When the future of my country will be assured, we will be willing to pass the command to others.'' Denounced by Arabs An agreement worked out between Israel and the Lebanese Government in that month provided that the major was to get the title of deputy Lebanese commander in the area. The major was dissatisfied, and the agreement was not implemented, Israeli sources said, because of Arab pressure. Over the years, some Arabs denounced the major as a renegade. But he contended that he had been a patriot who, with Israel's help, had saved southern Lebanon from foreign domination when Syria extended its power elsewhere in his country. He stepped down from command of his militia temporarily in October, saying he needed rest. He named Sharbal Barakat, a Maronite Christian, as his temporary replacement. After being treated in an Israeli hospital in Haifa, he was flown back to Merj 'Uyun this month and was treated there by Lebanese and Israeli doctors."

He was 76. He had been having treatment for heart and respiratory problems, said a friend, Michael Gaiman. Mr. Creach may have been best known for his years with the San Francisco-based rock group Jefferson Airplane, which later became Jefferson Starship. He toured with Jefferson Starship for the last two years, and although hobbled by arthritis he was still able to bring audiences to their feet with soulful riffs on his electric violin. John Creach was born in Beaver Falls, Pa., on May 28, 1917. When he was 18, he moved with his family to Chicago where he received some classical training and was briefly affiliated with the Illinois Symphony Orchestra. On Tour With a Group In the 1930's, he formed the Chocolate Music Bars, a group that played jazz, blues and popular music throughout the United States and Canada. Mr. Creach settled in Los Angeles in the late 1940's, and performed in cocktail lounges all over California for the next 20 years with the Johnny Creach Trio. A friend, Joey Covington, introduced Mr. Creach to members of Jefferson Airplane in 1970. Mr. Covington later joined the band as its drummer. Nicknamed Papa by the band, Mr. Creach performed and recorded with Jefferson Airplane until its breakup in 1972. He also performed with Airplane members in the group Hot Tuna from 1971 to 1973. 'Things We'll Remember' Paul Kantner, a founding member of Jefferson Airplane, said Mr. Creach was a strong influence on the group, both musically and personally. ""Papa John taught us all things we'll remember well into the next century,"" he said today. In 1992, Mr. Creach recorded ""Papa Blues,"" his first CD and his first all-blues set, with the Bernie Pearl Blues Band. The album received widespread acclaim. Last year, the Memphis-based Blues Foundation presented him with its W. C. Handy Award as an outstanding blues musician. He is survived by his wife, Sylvia, two brothers and a sister."

Tierney, a retired judge in the New York City and State courts, died on Tuesday at the New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center in New Rochelle.","Charles G. Tierney, a retired judge in the New York City and State courts, died on Tuesday at the New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center in New Rochelle. He was 86 and lived in Pelham. Justice Tierney was elected to the City Civil Court in 1961 and to the State Supreme Court in 1974. He retired in 1982 as a justice of the Appellate Term of that court. In an early case challenging the city's landmarks law, he rescinded the landmarking of the five Sailors Snug Harbor buildings on Staten Island, whose owner had sought their demolition and redevelopment. His 1967 opinion embodied the major argument against landmarking, saying it amounted to the government's taking property without just compensation. But the law was eventually upheld when his ruling was appealed and overturned. Congressional Counsel In another case in 1967, he ordered Mayor John V. Lindsay and other city officials to crack down on what the judge called ""the madness and unhealthy situation that is rapidly enveloping"" Greenwich Village. Residents had sued to stop the nuisances created by the crowds drawn to late-night coffee houses and shops. The Mayor objected to the ruling as extraordinary and said the city was already taking action. Before becoming a judge, Mr. Tierney was a lawyer with a general civil practice. From 1951-57 he was the chief counsel to the Public Works Committee of the House of Representatives and from 1957-61 was the chief attorney of the New York State Insurance Fund. A Democrat, he was a protege of United States Representative Charles Buckley, the party's chairman in the Bronx. Justice Tierney was born in Manhattan. He was educated at Manhattan College and Fordham Law School. In World War II, he served as a lieutenant in the Navy in the Atlantic and Pacific. His first wife, Catherine, died in 1968. He is survived by his second wife, the former Dorothy Walker; two daughters, Clare Carr and Ann Barrett, both of Hazlet, N.J.; two stepdaughters, Angela Robertson and Joyce Turvin; three stepsons, Warren, George and Paul McGoldrick, and seven grandchildren."
27413,,"Qiao Guanhua, a former Chinese Foreign Minister who fell into disgrace for his purported connections with the radical faction now castigated as the Gang of Four, died of lung cancer today.","PEKING, Sept. 22 Qiao Guanhua, a former Chinese Foreign Minister who fell into disgrace for his purported connections with the radical faction now castigated as the Gang of Four, died of lung cancer today. He was 70 years old. The official New China News Agency, in reporting Mr. Qiao's death, omitted any mention of his previous career and identified him only as an adviser to the Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, a post in which he surfaced last February after more than six years in official obscurity. Mr. Qiao, an urbane German-educated journalist who turned diplomat, was a protege of Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who died in 1976. Mr. Qiao led Peking's first delegation to the United Nations when China was admitted in 1971 and played a role in the normalization of China's relations with the United States. He became Foreign Minister in 1974, but was dismissed in late 1976 following the arrest of Jiang Qing, the widow of chairman Mao Zedong, and the other members of the Gang of Four. One of the charges was that his second wife, Zhang Hanzi, was a close friend of Miss Jiang, who is now in prison. Earned Doctorate in Germany Mr. Qiao, who was respected abroad as a capable and intelligent spokesman for China, was born in Jiangsu province, the birthplace of Mr. Zhou, in 1913. Mr. Qiao studied philosophy at Qinghua University in Peking and then went to Germany to earn a doctorate at the University of T""ubingen. He became fluent in English as well as German. He returned to China shortly before the outbreak of China's war with Japan and joined the propaganda department of the Kuomintang Government before making his reputation as a leftist journalist. By one account, he joined the Communist Party in 1940. Mr. Qiao moved to Hong Kong where he wrote under the pen name of Qiao Mu. When the Japanese captured Hong Kong, Mr. Qiao made his way back into China, living for a while with Communist guerrillas near Canton before arriving in China's wartime capital of Chungking. There he joined the Communist liaison mission, wrote for the Communist press, and joined Zhou Enlai in negotiations with the Nationalist Government. After civil war broke out, Mr. Qiao went back to Hong Kong as bureau chief of the New China News Agency, but returned to Peking when the Communists took power in 1949. Accompanied Zhou Abroad He accompanied Mr. Zhou on subsequent official travels abroad. Mr. Qiao's first wife, Gong Pang, another disciple of Mr. Zhou, headed the Foreign Ministry's Information Department for nearly 10 years. After she died in 1970, Mr. Qiao married Miss Zhang, who had been an English-language interpreter with the first Chinese mission to the United Nations. Mr. Qiao worked closely with Mr. Zhou in developing the first cautious contacts with the United States. He and Henry Kissinger drafted the Shanghai communique during President Richard M. Nixon's visit to China in 1972 that opened the way to the normalization of relations between Washington and Peking. In 1974, Mr. Qiao became China's Foreign Minister. After addressing the United Nations General Assembly in 1976, he returned home only to be replaced by Huang Hua, who stepped down as Foreign Minister nearly a year ago. Mr. Qiao was interrogated about his ties to the radicals led by Miss Jiang. It appeared that he had gotten into trouble because of her close association with his second wife, Miss Zhang, whose father, Zhang Shizhao had been a teacher of the young Mao. Mr. Qiao was also reported to have led criticism in the Foreign Ministry of Deng Xiaoping, now China's top leader, when he was discredited by the radicals in 1976."
8322,"Kenny Baker, the R2-D2 Robot in 'Star Wars,' Dies at 81","Kenny Baker, the British actor who rose to fame by playing the robot R2-D2 in six ''Star Wars'' films, died on Saturday.","Kenny Baker, the British actor who rose to fame by playing the robot R2-D2 in six ''Star Wars'' films, died on Saturday. He was 81. His death was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Lucasfilm, the company that created and produces the enormously popular ''Star Wars'' franchise. Mr. Baker was a little person whose adult height was widely reported to be 3 feet 8 inches. He referred to his short stature as ''my height difficulties'' in an autobiographical sketch on his official website, but it would have been impossible for a taller man to play the role that made him famous. ''They said, 'You've got to do it; we can't find anybody else. You're small enough to get into it and you're strong enough to be able to move it,''' he said of R2-D2's cylindrical metal costume in a video interview in Stockholm that he shared on his website. ''I was a godsend to them, really.'' [Video: Kenny Baker Interview Watch on YouTube.] Mr. Baker was born on Aug. 24, 1934, in Birmingham, England. He began his entertainment career in 1950 as part of a traveling troupe in Britain called Burton Lester's Midgets. He soon left that act and toured the country for many years, performing in theaters, nightclubs and holiday resorts in a variety of roles: a circus clown, a performer in an ice-skating show and, later, as part of a musical comedy and variety act alongside the performer Jack Purvis. (Mr. Purvis also acted in ''Star Wars,'' playing the diminutive, cloaked Jawa who shoots R2-D2, Mr. Baker said.) The traveling act brought Mr. Baker financial security and a measure of fame in Britain, but it was an entertainment ecosystem that was wiped out by the invention of television. Then came R2-D2. That role began with the 1977 release of ''Star Wars,'' but it was a part he almost did not take. ''This film came along and I turned it down,'' Mr. Baker said during the interview in Stockholm. ''I said, 'I don't want to be stuck in a robot, what for, for goodness sake.''' He ultimately relented and agreed to take the job as a favor to George Lucas, he said. The role had no lines -- the character's signature beeps and boops were not voiced by Mr. Baker -- and, seated inside the robot, he never showed his face. But R2-D2 so changed his career that in later years he told an interviewer that if he could go back in time, he would do it again for free. ''Had I known I would have done it for nothing because he was broke at the beginning, he didn't have a penny, George,'' Mr. Baker said. But he might have asked for a share of the film's profits, he said. ''I'd be a millionaire like Alec Guinness was!'' Mr. Lucas said in a statement on Saturday that Mr. Baker was ''an incredible trooper who always worked hard under difficult circumstances.'' He added, ''A talented vaudevillian who could always make everybody laugh, Kenny was truly the heart and soul of R2-D2 and will be missed by all his fans and everyone who knew him.'' Mr. Baker played R2-D2 in six ''Star Wars'' films and also acted in a number of other high-profile movies, including ''Mona Lisa,'' ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' ''Time Bandits'' and ''Amadeus.'' No information about his survivors was immediately available. His niece Abigail Shield first reported his death to The Guardian newspaper."

He was 79. The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Lori Chapman. He had been undergoing dialysis treatment for kidney problems for several years, she said. Mr. Harrison was the son of the English actor Rex Harrison, a star of ''My Fair Lady'' and ''Doctor Dolittle,'' and the first of his father's six wives, Collette Thomas. He initially resisted acting, he said, because he wanted to distance himself from his father's reputation. ''I always regarded it with awe and trepidation,'' he told The Los Angeles Times in 1968. ''Because, I suppose, my father is a famous actor.'' Mr. Harrison focused instead on music and skiing, competing on England's alpine ski teams at the 1952 and 1956 Olympic Games and singing folk and calypso songs in nightclubs around Europe. He often performed at the Blue Angel in London, where he was encouraged by a young Paul McCartney. Mainstream success eluded him, so he moved to the United States in the mid-1960s. His first hit was ''A Young Girl,'' an English version of Charles Aznavour's French ballad; it reached No. 51 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. He recorded albums that included Beatles and Bob Dylan songs and appeared on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and other television shows. He was also cast as Mark Slate, a secret-agent sidekick to April Dancer, played by Stefanie Powers, in ''The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.,'' a spinoff of ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' The show was canceled in 1967, but it raised Mr. Harrison's profile. He went on to perform with the Beach Boys and Sonny and Cher and to appear on shows like ''The Mod Squad'' and ''Mission: Impossible.'' He recorded ''The Windmills of Your Mind,'' composed by Michel Legrand with lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman, in 1968. Heard on the soundtrack of the film ''The Thomas Crown Affair,'' it won the 1968 Oscar for best original song. The song did not initially make an impression on Mr. Harrison. ''I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it,'' he wrote on his Web site. ''I didn't realize until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel Legrand and the Bergmans had written.'' Mr. Harrison missed the chance to perform the song at the Academy Awards ceremony because he was in England filming ''Take a Girl Like You,'' a comedy based on a novel by Kingsley Amis. (Jos Feliciano sang in his place.) He said he never tired of the song, and performed it in his final concert, in Black Dog, England, the Saturday night before he died. Noel John Christopher Harrison was born in London on Jan. 29, 1934. His parents divorced in 1940, and he left school as a teenager to ski in the Swiss Alps. He lived in Los Angeles during the peak of his career, but left in the early 1970s for a farm in Nova Scotia. While there he hosted ''Take Time,'' a music show for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He returned to Los Angeles for the tour of his one-man show, ''Adieu, Jacques ... ,'' about the singer Jacques Brel, before moving back to England. At his death he lived in Ashburton, in southwest England. Mr. Harrison's first two marriages, to the former Sara Tufnell and Margaret Harrison, ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Chapman, he is survived by two daughters, Cathryn Harrison-Laing and Harriet Harrison-Roger; a son, Simon; and a stepdaughter, Zoe Humphreys, from his first marriage. He is also survived by a son, Will, and a daughter, Chloe Harrison-Bayes, from his second marriage; two half-brothers, Carey Harrison and Richard Butler; and four grandchildren."

Fleischmann, the former president and chairman of The New Yorker magazine, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan at the age of 71. The cause was cancer, his family said. For 32 years he served as an officer of The New Yorker. His father, Raoul H. Fleischmann, was the financial backer who co-founded the magazine in 1925 with the editor Harold Ross, and was its first president, chairman and publisher. Mr. Fleischmann joined the company as a director in 1953. He became treasurer of the board in 1955, while still in his early 30's; executive vice president in 1965, and president in 1968. After his father's death in 1969, he succeeded as the chairman. For many years the magazine flourished, both as a literary journal and a business. At its peak, The New Yorker was forced to turn down some advertising for lack of space. In 1975, noting that the last time the magazine had borrowed money was in 1930, Mr. Fleischmann mused that ""banks get very cross at us."" In later years, however, revenues declined. Observed Strict SeparationXx Mr. Fleischmann upheld his father's tradition of strict separation of the magazine's business side from its editorial functions under Mr. Ross and his successor as editor, William Shawn. ""It's unique,"" Mr. Fleischmann said in 1975 of the editorial department's independence. ""I don't think anybody understands it except maybe Shawn and myself."" Control of The New Yorker was sold to Samuel I. Newhouse's Advance Publications in 1985 for $142 million. The next year, Mr. Fleischmann retired, citing ill health. Although he agreed to the sale and received more than $40 million for his stock, Mr. Fleischmann also expressed reluctance. ""The takeover of The New Yorker was hard to bear,"" he said afterward. ""For 60 years there had been a Fleischmann on the premises and in charge, and now there was none."" Mr. Fleischmann was born in Manhattan, descended from an Austrian immigrant family that started the Fleischmann yeast company. He graduated from Yale in 1944. During World War II he served as a captain in the Army, fighting the German counteroffensive in the Battle of the Bulge, and was wounded twice. After the war he went into business, working at Smith Barney & Company and serving as secretary-treasurer of Electronic Control Corporation. His first marriage ended in divorce. Surviving are his second wife, the former Jeanne Cowles; two sons, James R. of Langhorne, Pa., and Stephen F. of Manhattan; a daughter, Ruth Planitzer of Manhattan, and three grandchildren."

He was 78. His wife, Maureen, said the cause was complications of primary progressive aphasia. ''He was all basketball,'' Marv Albert, one of Mr. Andariese's radio and television partners, said in an interview. ''He was in very good shape for a long time, and he was always looking for a game. One of his thrills was on game day at Madison Square Garden -- he'd play on the court with Garden employees.'' Mr. Andariese (pronounced AN-drays) and Mr. Albert established an easygoing camaraderie nearly from the start of their first season together on the radio, when the Knicks won the 1973 N.B.A. championship. Mr. Andariese brought to the job a sophisticated knowledge of New York City basketball, which he had nurtured as a player at Fordham University. But he had not been a major college star and, unlike most N.B.A. analysts, did not play or coach in the league.. ''I wasn't a famous player,'' he told The Daily News in 2005. ''That's why I came to define the analyst as a giving function. If you don't give, you are not doing your job.'' He said that he was driven during games to spread his love of the game and explain how talented N.B.A. players were. ''That's what feeds me to this day, that I realize this gift, and I love to share the understanding of that gift with people,'' he was quoted as saying by the Knicks' team historian, Dennis D'Agostino, in an appreciation of Mr. Andariese's career that was published Tuesday on the website of MSG Network, which televises Knick games. John Kenneth Andariese was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 19, 1938, to Harold Andariese and the former Mary Ellen Burns. He played basketball at Fordham under Johnny Bach, who became an assistant in the 1980s to Chicago Bulls Coach Phil Jackson, the Knicks' current president. Mr. Andariese played on two Fordham teams that went to the N.I.T. He averaged 13.0 points and 8.7 rebounds a game during the 1959-60 season. Mr. Albert jokingly introduced him at dinner events and other appearances as the ''53rd leading rebounder in the history of Fordham.'' After graduation, he served stateside in the Army and played professionally for the Allentown Jets of the Eastern Basketball League. Mr. Andariese was calling college basketball games when he was hired to work with Mr. Albert, starting in the 1972-73 season. Mr. Albert recalled traveling to Los Angeles to call Game 1 of the N.B.A. finals between the Knicks and Lakers: ''The first thing we did was to shoot around at Pauley Pavilion,'' home to the powerhouse U.C.L.A. basketball team that was coached by John Wooden. During the game, Mr. Albert added, ''John had one of his career highlights'' at halftime, when he interviewed the actor Peter Falk. ''After that,'' he added, ''any time we were in L.A. or New York, Falk would come over to us to look at the halftime stat sheet.'' For decades, Mr. Andariese kept his own portable record of the league by meticulously cutting out the box scores of every game and taping them into schoolboy notebooks, some of which he would tote to games as reference. ''I have cases of them,'' Maureen Andariese said. ''I'd get up at 2 a.m., and he'd be cutting out box scores and highlighting articles.'' In addition to calling Knicks games on radio and television, Mr. Andariese worked for ESPN, Turner Sports and NBA TV. He retired from calling Knicks games in 2012, as his health problems began to affect his work. Two years later, he received the Curt Gowdy Media Award from the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In addition to his wife, the former Maureen Hayden, he is survived by three daughters, Amy McLaughlin, Julie Collins and Emily Wright; four grandchildren; and a sister, Janet Cianci. His first marriage ended in divorce. For one of his birthdays, Maureen Andariese said, she built him a regulation N.B.A. court on their property in upstate Montgomery, N.Y. ''It had old-fashioned glass backboards, and he had a ball-retrieving thing that kept the balls from going into the cornfield,'' she said. ''He loved it. His friends would go out and shoot with him.'' Read more obituaries and follow our coverage on Twitter."

9962,"Freya von Moltke, 98; Part of a Core of Nazi Resistance","''He put the question to me explicitly -- 'The time is coming when something must be done,' '' Freya von Moltke said. ''","''He put the question to me explicitly -- 'The time is coming when something must be done,' '' Freya von Moltke said. '' 'I would like to have a hand in it, but I can only do so if you join in too,' and I said, 'Yes, it's worth it.' '' So, with a wife's assent, began a famous challenge to Hitler. At the height of the Nazi victories, Count Helmuth James von Moltke invited about two dozen foes of Nazism, many of them aristocrats like himself, to imagine a new, better postwar Germany. For him, his wife's participation was essential, as she remembered the conversation in ''Courageous Hearts: Women and the Anti-Hitler Plot of 1944,'' a 1997 book by Dorothee von Meding. The dissidents met at the count's ancestral estate, Kreisau, which Bismarck had given his legendary great-great-uncle, Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, for his victories over Austria and France. It was a perilous act of resistance. As many as half of the dissidents were later executed, some for actively plotting to kill Hitler, others for thinking the unthinkable: they had marshaled logical, moral and religious arguments to question the legitimacy of the Third Reich. Their high-minded planning for a future without Nazis angered a regime that expected to endure 1,000 years. Mrs. Moltke, who disdained the title of countess, was the last living active participant in the group. She died of a viral infection on Jan. 1 at her home in Norwich, Vt., her son Helmuth said. She was 98. In his book ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'' (1960), William L. Shirer said the Kreisau circle had provided ''the intellectual, spiritual, ethical, philosophical and, to some extent, political ideas of the resistance to Hitler.'' They initially rejected violence, if only for fear of making Hitler a martyr. But as the killing went on, support for assassinating him grew. Indeed, military conspirators were pushing ahead. At 12:40 p.m. on July 20, 1944, a bomb they had planted in a suitcase beneath a table at which Hitler was sitting at the Wolf's Lair field headquarters exploded. Hitler suffered only minor wounds. Mrs. Moltke said she believed that her husband would have backed that assassination attempt -- had he not already been in jail for warning a friend, Dr. Otto Kiep, who was plotting violence against Hitler, that Dr. Kiep risked imminent arrest. Count Moltke was never released. He was hanged, most likely by piano wire, in January 1945 after Gestapo agents had linked the assassination attempt at Wolf's Lair to the Kreisau circle. In fact, there is strong evidence that Count Moltke was in contact with the July 20 conspirators. Andreas Hermes, one of the few ringleaders who were not executed, told The New York Times in July 1945 that he ''vividly'' recalled Count Moltke's participation. Women who joined their husbands to oppose Hitler treaded the same dangerous ground as the men. Mrs. Moltke could have faced the death penalty simply for serving food and drinks to the conspirators. Her husband relied on her first impressions of people to make life-and-death judgments. She contributed ideas, particularly on legal issues, and her expertise. In an enduring contribution, she gathered up Kreisau circle documents and letters from her husband and hid them in the estate's beehives. In 1990 she published them as ''Letters to Freya.'' The papers have proved valuable to scholars for their gripping portrayal of heroic, almost certainly futile resistance, as well as for their glimpses at daily life in the Third Reich. In her later years, when the German government and others came to recognize her contributions, Mrs. Moltke expressed gratitude on behalf of other resistance widows as well. ''We were all wives of our husbands,'' she said. Mrs. Moltke's son said in an interview that the only surviving wife of a Kreisau circle member is Clarita von Trott, whose husband, Adam, played a central part in the July 20 plot and was executed in 1944. Freya Deichmann, whose father was a banker, was born in Cologne on March 29, 1911. She attended idealistic work camps that brought young people of all classes together to share ideas and dreams. At 18, while on a vacation to Austria's lake district, she met Count Moltke. They married two years later, in 1931. He studied in Germany and Britain to become an international lawyer. In 1939, he was drafted to work in military intelligence. His boss, Adm. Wilhelm Canaris, a covert foe of Hitler, encouraged him to use his legal and political expertise to save Jews and curb German atrocities. On trips abroad, he met with Allied officials to discuss a possible coup. Mrs. Moltke was haunted by the first time she saw Hitler in 1931 or 1932. She had noticed a man in a dark movie theater, she told Ms. von Meding in ''Courageous Hearts.'' ''I thought to myself, what terrifying eyes,'' she said. When the house lights went on, she saw who he was. Mrs. Moltke earned a doctorate in law from Humboldt University in Berlin in 1935. She then took over management of Kreisau, then in eastern Germany and now part of Poland. The Kreisau circle began informally among friends, then became more serious as members assembled in small groups in Berlin to discuss specific subjects, like a new constitution. Larger meetings at Kreisau occurred in the spring and fall of 1942 and the spring of 1943. The circle and the Moltke family benefited from the immense prestige of Count Moltke's military ancestor. Another protection was the fervent pro-Nazi views of the manager of the estate; his local stature helped contain public denunciations of a family that refused to say ''Heil Hitler.'' Mrs. Moltke's letters to Count Moltke in prison concerned farm matters, like the wisdom of keeping a pair of ducks. She told her husband that the Gestapo officer who read all his letters had spoken nicely to her on a visit. ''They're not really so bad,'' she ventured. ''Except when they tear out your fingernails,'' Count Moltke answered (though he was not tortured in that way, he said). After the war, Mrs. Moltke moved to South Africa and did social work, but she grew to hate the country's official system of racial segregation and eventually returned to Germany. She moved to Vermont in 1960 to join the philosopher Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, whose wife had died. They had met in the youth camp movement and, after reuniting, remained companions until his death in 1973. In 1998, she helped turn Kreisau -- Krzyzowa in Polish -- into a center to promote understanding between Germany and Poland. In 2004, a foundation named after her was set up to support it. Besides her son Helmuth, Mrs. Moltke is survived by six grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. Another son, Konrad, died in 2005. The letters Mrs. Moltke hid in the beehives remain poignant. In the last one he wrote before his execution, Count Moltke said he would ''gladly accompany'' his wife ''a bit further on this earth.'' ''But then I would need a new task from God,'' he continued. ''The task for which God made me is done.''"

19613,"Chocolate Armenteros, Influential Trumpeter in Afro-Cuban Tradition, Dies at 87","Chocolate Armenteros, a Cuban trumpeter who was a standard-bearer of the Afro-Cuban musical tradition for almost seven decades, died on Jan. 6 in a nursing home in Mohegan Lake, N.Y.","Chocolate Armenteros, a Cuban trumpeter who was a standard-bearer of the Afro-Cuban musical tradition for almost seven decades, died on Jan. 6 in a nursing home in Mohegan Lake, N.Y. He was 87. The cause was complications of prostate cancer, his son, Alfredo Armenteros Jr., said. As Afro-Cuban dance music progressed from the 1940s onward, modernizing and gaining influence in New York and the rest of the world, Mr. Armenteros could often be found at the center of the changes, playing with innovators and popularizers including Arsenio Rodrguez, Cachao Lopez, Benny Mor and Eddie Palmieri. He was a strong, clear soloist who phrased as a singer does, with an organized narrative sense. ''For me, a solo is like a letter,'' he told the musicologist Isabelle Leymarie. ''In a letter there is the date, the name of the person it's being sent to, the usual greetings, the content and the ending. There has to be a complete structure.'' Alfredo Armenteros was born on April 4, 1928, in Ranchuelo, in the Villa Clara province of central Cuba, where his father, Lazaro Alfredo Armenteros, who had been a trombonist in his youth, owned farmland and a grocery store. He was taught in his early years by Eduardo Eges, a teacher and dance-band leader who was a tenant on his father's land, and who brought him into a children's band at a local school. After moving to Havana in 1949, Mr. Armenteros made his recording debut on the song ''Para Nias y Seoras,'' with the singer Ren Alvarez's Conjunto Los Astros, that May. Speaking of his elegant, aggressive improvising on that record, the bassist Andy Gonzalez told the historian Richard Davies that if music students ''study that solo, they will know what the 'swing' of son is.'' Mr. Armenteros also recorded in 1949 and 1950 with the musician and bandleader Arsenio Rodrguez, a foundational figure of modern Cuban dance music. He performed and toured with the band Sonora Matancera, with the pianist Bebo Valds's group in 1952, and, from 1953 to 1955, with his cousin Benny More, the popular Cuban singer. (It was around this time that he gained his nickname, for his resemblance to the Cuban boxer Kid Chocolate.) In 1957 Mr. Armenteros performed in New York with Machito and His Afro-Cubans, probably the pre-eminent Cuban dance band in the city at the time. A year later, he returned with a group led by the flutist Jos Fajardo to play at a private dance for a campaign event for John F. Kennedy at the Waldorf Astoria. It was a charanga-style band, characterized by the sound of the flute and two violins, and the band's appearance in New York drew the attention of the manager of the Palladium ballroom, who subsequently booked it for a sold-out Thanksgiving dance -- a central event to the growing popularity of the style in New York. By 1960 he had relocated to the city permanently. Through the '60s and '70s, Mr. Armenteros worked with Machito and most of the other major Latin-music bandleaders of the day, including Tito Puente, Tito Rodrguez, Larry Harlow and Mon Rivera. With Mr. Palmieri, the pianist, he was the crucial link to an older Afro-Latin tradition in some groundbreaking works of early-'70s salsa, including Mr. Palmieri's albums ''Superimposition'' and ''Vamonos Pa'l Monte.'' In 1975 he took part in the freewheeling past-meets-present sessions organized by the musicologist Rene Lopez, resulting in the landmark album ''Concepts in Unity,'' under the ensemble name Grupo Folklrico y Experimental Nuevayorkino. He also began making his own albums, including ''En El Rincn'' (1976), ''Chocolate Dice'' (1982) and ''Caliente'' (1998), and he recorded with the bassist Israel Cachao Lpez on both volumes of the ''Master Sessions'' albums, the first of which won a Grammy Award for best tropical Latin album in 1995. Mr. Armenteros lived in East Harlem. In addition to his son, his survivors include his longtime companion, Betty Ramos; two granddaughters; and six daughters in Cuba, although the family has been in contact with only one, Anacatalina Armenteros."

17110,"Walter Kohn, 93, a Nobel-Winning Scientist","Walter Kohn, an Austrian-born American scientist and former refugee who shared a Nobel Prize in Chemistry -- a subject that he had last formally studied in high school -- died on last Tuesday in Santa Barbara, Calif.","Walter Kohn, an Austrian-born American scientist and former refugee who shared a Nobel Prize in Chemistry -- a subject that he had last formally studied in high school -- died on last Tuesday in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 93. The cause was cancer of the jaw, his wife, Mara Vishniac Kohn, said. As a teenager, Dr. Kohn had escaped to England from Nazi-occupied Vienna less than a month before World War II erupted, found himself shipped to Canada as an ''enemy alien'' and later built a long, distinguished academic career in the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1957. He was awarded the chemistry prize by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1998. At the time, he was teaching at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He shared the award with John A. Pople, a British-born mathematician at Northwestern University. Dr. Kohn was credited with a discovery that applied quantum mechanics and advanced mathematics to explain complex chemical reactions. ''Walter Kohn showed that it is not necessary to consider the motion of each individual electron,'' the Swedish Academy said. ''It suffices to know the average number of electrons located at any one point in space.'' His theoretical research into atomic behavior and the formation of chemical bonds enabled scientists to develop new molecules that formed the basis for innovative materials custom designed for medicines and for advances in electronics. The approach became known as the Density-Functional Theory. It is the basis of many aspects of computational chemistry, in which the geometric structure of molecules can be mapped and reactions predicted. Dr. Kohn was born in Vienna on March 9, 1923, the son of Salomon Kohn, who ran a business selling artistic postcards, and the former Gittel Rappaport, whom Dr. Kohn described in an autobiographical sketch for the Nobel committee as ''a highly educated woman with a good knowledge of German, Latin, Polish and French and some acquaintance with Greek, Hebrew and English.'' As middle-class Jews, the family summered on the Baltic Sea until Hitler came to power. Dr. Kohn said his parents ''were a part of the secular artistic and intellectual life of Vienna.'' Dr. Kohn appeared headed to work for the family business when it was confiscated in Germany's annexation of Austria, known as the Anschluss, in 1938. Expelled from public school, he enrolled in a Jewish school and there became enamored of math and physics. As persecution of the Jews escalated, his parents put him on a Kindertransport rescue convoy for refugees bound for England, where his older sister had arrived earlier. The parents were later murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz. In England, by his account, Dr. Kohn assumed he would become a farmer. ''I had seen too many unemployed intellectuals during the 1930s,'' he wrote in the Nobel sketch. Instead, after contracting meningitis and becoming too frail to work on a farm, he enrolled in school and continued his scientific studies. In 1940, on Winston Churchill's orders, he and other male ''enemy aliens,'' the term for those who held German passports, were shipped to detention camps in Canada. There he continued his education, enlisted in the Canadian Army, and then earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Toronto. He earned his doctorate in physics at Harvard University. Dr. Kohn went on to teach, mostly physics, at Harvard, Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the University of California, first at San Diego and then at Santa Barbara, joining its faculty in 1979. He became the founding director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics (now the Kavli Institute) at Santa Barbara and had been professor emeritus there since 1991. He also helped establish a program of Judaic studies at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Kohn's first marriage, to Lois Adams, ended in divorce. Besides his second wife, Mara, the daughter of Roman Vishniac, the photographer and biologist, Dr. Kohn is survived by three daughters from his first marriage, Marilyn Kohn, Ingrid Paymar and Rosalind Dimenstein, and three grandchildren. ''Physics isn't what I do,'' Dr. Kohn once said. ''It is what I am.'' As late as 1998, Dr. Kohn was an in-line skater, boasted of his homemade ratatouille and echoed his father's turn to pacifism after the elder Mr. Kohn had lost a brother during World War I. Decades after enlisting as a Canadian infantryman, Dr. Kohn actively opposed the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union and joined other faculty members in unsuccessfully seeking to terminate the University of California's role as manager of national nuclear weapons laboratories at Los Alamos, N.M., and Livermore, Calif."

She was 105, including the three years that Hollywood publicists subtracted in the 1930's. Her title role in the operetta ""Rose-Marie,"" her first venture into musical theater, was one of the biggest Broadway hits of the 1920's, running for 558 performances. Arthur Hammerstein, the producer, ordered it written especially for her, and long before Jeanette MacDonald's hit version of ""Indian Love Call"" from the 1936 film adaptation, critics universally hailed Miss Ellis's highly trained singing. Her dramatic career lasted until she was 97, although she appeared exclusively in England after the 1930's, partly because of a breach with Hammerstein that kept her permanently off the American musical stage. Her London stage consort, the composer and actorIvor Novello, a leading rival of Noel Coward, called her his inspiration and built several hits around her. She also had a major London success with Jerome Kern's ""Music in the Air."" Miss Ellis's glamorous circle included Fred and Adele Astaire, Harpo Marx and George Gershwin, with whom she fell fruitlessly in love. In her Hollywood career, Fritz Lang and Marlene Dietrich were her great friends. Her personal life was chronicled, husband by husband, in the press. ""We were all mad and in love with life and work, and each other,"" she wrote in her autobiography, ""Those Dancing Years"" (John Murray, 1982). Miss Ellis was born May Belle Elsas on June 15, 1897, at 131 West 95th Street in Manhattan. Her name, considered too German sounding, was changed when she joined the Metropolitan Opera. Her father, who had arrived from Germany with only a few coins in his pocket, eventually became president of Consolidated Paper Mills. Her mother showed promise as a concert pianist before her marriage. Miss Ellis's parents wanted her to be a painter, but after hearing Geraldine Farrar sing, she once said, ""there was nothing in my mind but opera."" At 18, she signed a four-year contract with the Met. She had important roles, including Mityl in the premiere of Albert Wolff's ""Blue Bird."" She sang a minor part with Enrico Caruso in one of his last performances, in Donizetti's ""Elisir d'Amore,"" in Brooklyn in 1920. Against all advice, she left the Met to act in Shakespearean productions on Broadway for the actor and producer David Belasco. That work led to ""Rose-Marie,"" originally about a sweet French-Canadian girl and her love for a fur trapper wrongly accused of murder. (The Canadian mountie, a minor role in the stage version, became the love interest in the movie, in which he was personified by Nelson Eddy.) Miss Ellis left the show after a year to appear in ""The Dybbuk,"" a dramatic production at the Neighborhood Playhouse on the Lower East Side, where she happily traded a weekly paycheck of $500 for one of $10. Arthur Hammerstein was furious and forced her to sign an agreement preventing her from singing for any management but his. She never sang onstage in the United States again. Miss Ellis had already been divorced twice when she began appearing with Basil Sydney, an English matinee idol, in productions that included a long-running modern-dress version of ""The Taming of the Shrew. They married on a whim in 1929. There were professional tensions between the two, some caused by the offers she received to act in plays and films for which her husband was turned down. They appeared together in many plays in London until their marriage collapsed in a highly public divorce. But she was always busy with her own career, including a deal to make three pictures for Paramount. Though her movies, including ""All the King's Horses"" (1934), were considered mediocre at best, her own acting and singing voice drew praise. Graham Greene lamented ""the waste of her sensuous appeal, her Bacchanalian gleam"" in that film. She also appeared successfully in dramas, like the London production of ""Strange Interlude"" in 1931. But her greatest fame was in musicals, and by the late 1930's, she was one of the most popular stars of the West End, appearing in shows created by Novello and in costumes by Cecil Beaton. Some of the shows Novello wrote for her included ""Glamorous Night"" and ""The Dancing Years."" During World War II, Miss Ellis spent three years working as an ambulance driver and a practical nurse. She went on to win excellent reviews for a string of postwar roles, including a leading part in Terence Rattigan's hit drama ""The Browning Version."" She retired from the stage in 1970 but continued to act on television and in radio plays. Her last role, in 1994, was in the Sherlock Holmes television series starring Jeremy Brett. Miss Ellis leaves no immediate survivors. Her last husband was Jock Muir Stewart Robinson, whom she married in 1938 after a hectic courtship. He was an enthusiastic pilot, skier and climber, and although she hated mountain climbing, she willingly accompanied him. He died in a climbing accident in 1950. She never married again."

Nathanson, Author of 'The Dirty Dozen,' Dies at 88","athanson, whose best-selling 1965 novel ''The Dirty Dozen'' became the basis of one of the most enduring, if preposterous, World War II movies to come out of Hollywood, died on Tuesday at his home in Laguna Niguel, Calif.","E. M. Nathanson, whose best-selling 1965 novel ''The Dirty Dozen'' became the basis of one of the most enduring, if preposterous, World War II movies to come out of Hollywood, died on Tuesday at his home in Laguna Niguel, Calif. He was 88. His death was confirmed by his wife, Elizabeth Henderson. A New Yorker who moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1950s, Mr. Nathanson was writing for magazines, often about the military, when a neighbor in Hollywood Hills told him a story that would evolve into his first novel. The neighbor was Russ Meyer, the filmmaker who later became known as King Leer for directing soft-core films featuring big-breasted women. Meyer, who died in 2004, had been a combat photographer and cameraman during World War II, and he recounted an episode at an Army stockade in England in which he shot a company of prisoners who were training, he was told, for a top secret mission behind enemy lines just before D-Day. Mr. Nathanson was intrigued, and he set about doing the research for what he imagined would be a nonfiction book about the company. Unable to confirm that such a company existed, he nonetheless found a trove of information in court-martial transcripts and other documents about the men in Army stockades during the war. From these, he created the characters for a novel that he called ''The Dirty Dozen,'' the title referring to a collective refusal to bathe or shave during training. The company in the novel did bear a resemblance to a group known as the Filthy 13, a band of rambunctious, authority-defying paratroopers who were far better known for drinking than for washing up, who were in and out of the stockade, and who landed behind German lines just before the invasion of Normandy. They were not, however, the murderers, rapists and borderline madmen depicted by Mr. Nathanson, who always contended that his book was based on Meyer's initial tale and his own imagination. ''Powerfully prosaic,'' as Kirkus Reviews called it, ''The Dirty Dozen'' reportedly sold more than two million copies. The movie, directed by Robert Aldrich, came out in 1967 and became a pop culture landmark partly for its virtually all-male cast, a mix of Hollywood stars like Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan; a pop singer, Trini Lopez; an athlete transitioning to show business, Jim Brown; and several actors who were becoming or would become big names -- Donald Sutherland, John Cassavetes, Telly Savalas, George Kennedy and Charles Bronson. The irresistible plot turned the major in charge of the company (Marvin) into a sneerer at fatuous military authority and a harsh disciplinarian who nonetheless stood up for every man in his charge; the criminals, more eccentrics than psychopaths, turn out to be heroes when they blow up their target, a luxurious rest house for German officers. The movie was nominated for four Oscars, and it was listed at No. 65 on a list of the ''100 most thrilling American films'' compiled by the American Film Institute. Erwin Nathanson was born in the Bronx on Feb. 17, 1928. His father, Stanley, was a laborer; his mother, the former Ruth Goldberg, suffered from depression, and when she went into an institution, Erwin, age 2, was placed in a Jewish orphanage in Manhattan. He lived there until he was 7, when he was sent to the Hebrew National Orphan Home in Yonkers, where he lived until he finished high school. He had aspirations to be a journalist, and for a time he worked as a copy boy for Women's Wear Daily and as a stringer for The Washington Post. He moved to Los Angeles in 1956. His other books include ''A Dirty Distant War'' (1987), a sequel of sorts to ''The Dirty Dozen'' set in Asia, in which the same Office of Strategic Services officer who organized the criminal company finds himself in French Indochina fighting with local guerrillas against the Japanese; ''The Latecomers'' (1970), about a psychologically deluded actor with a Christ obsession; ''It Gave Everybody Something to Do'' (with Louise Thoresen), a seeming memoir about a grotesque marriage that ends in murder (1974); ''Knight's Cross'' (with Aaron Bank), about German P.O.W.s who turn traitor (1993); and ''Lovers and Schemers'' (2003), a fictionalized social history of coastal Southern California from the 1960s through the 1990s. Mr. Nathanson's first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Henderson, whom he married in 1985, he is survived by a half brother, Donald Nathanson; a son, Michael; and two daughters, Larisa and Adriana Nathanson. Mr. Nathanson was known as Mick, the M in E.M. In an essay about his time at the orphan home, he explained how that came about: ''I was nicknamed 'Mike' by my father. At the home I was nicknamed 'Mickey.' Once I had a girlfriend, more than 50 years ago, who liked ''Mick'' better, and so did I, so that's who I became.''"

34300,Marcel Ravidat Is Dead at 72; Found Lascaux Cave Paintings,"Marcel Ravidat, who in 1940 discovered the Lascaux cave paintings whose brilliantly colored renderings of prehistoric animals had been sealed from view for 17,000 years, died on Wednesday at his home in the village Montignac in the Dordogne region of southwestern France.","Marcel Ravidat, who in 1940 discovered the Lascaux cave paintings whose brilliantly colored renderings of prehistoric animals had been sealed from view for 17,000 years, died on Wednesday at his home in the village Montignac in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. He was 72. Village officials said the cause of death was a heart attack. Mr. Ravidat, at the time an 18-year-old apprentice garage mechanic, was in the company of three friends when he took a walk in the French woods and made the chance discovery of what has been described as the very cradle of art. By some accounts it occurred when his dog, Robot, chased a rabbit into a hole that led to the cave, by others when he simply discovered the hole himself while he and his friends were searching for a fabled underground passage to a nearby chateau. However the discovery was made, it proved immediately riveting to archeologists and a generation of awed tourists who flocked to the cave until it was closed in 1963 to protect the 600 paintings and 1,500 engravings from further deterioration. Although the area around Montignac is laced with caves whose prehistoric wall paintings had been long known, the paintings in the Lascaux cave have been the only ones found whose original hues have not faded. Unlike the other caves, Lascaux, whose protective layer of chalk had made it water tight, had been so completely sealed for so long that even today no one has discovered the entrance used by the prehistoric draftsmen who transformed its walls into a colorful menagerie. The small hole that Mr. Ravidat and his friends widened to gain access to the cave had been made the previous winter when a tree in the oak woods was uprooted by a storm, tearing away several feet of earth. Guy Davenport, whose short story ""Robot,"" provides a lightly fictionalized account of the discovery, noted yesterday from his home in Lexington, Ky., that a number of versions have appeared over the years. ""The story about the dog has been pretty much debunked,"" he said, recalling that Jacques Marsal, one of Mr. Ravidat's friends present at the discovery, had not mentioned it when the writer interviewed him in 1963. There is even some confusion about the date of the discovery, with some accounts listing it as Sept. 8, a Sunday, and others as Sept. 12, a Thursday, the traditional French school holiday. A composite version suggests that Mr. Ravidat discovered the hole leading to the cave on Sept. 8, but did not explore it until four days later when he returned to the site with his friends. By all accounts it was Mr. Ravidat who first descended into the hole and discovered the vast cave system, but the cave was so dark he did not immediately realize the full implications of what he had found. After borrowing a grease gun from the garage to use as a torch, he returned the next day and beheld the sight that transformed his life. The specter of the charging bulls, leaping stags and galloping horses was so riveting, Mr. Davenport said, that the boys maintained a vigil at the cave, keeping it a secret for a week until they finally told a teacher known for his expertise in prehistoric art. Because of the German occupation, the cave, which was used by French resistance to store weapons during World War II, was not open to the public until 1948. Along with Mr. Marsal, who died in 1989, Mr. Ravidat became an official guardian of the cave and a guide who never lost his initial awe at the sights his eyes had been the first to see for more than 15 millenniums. After the cave was closed in 1963 he became a mechanic at a nearby paper mill. He is survived by a wife and daughter."

She was 91 years old and lived in Toronto. Mrs. Reichmann arrived in Canada in the mid-1950's with her husband, Samuel, and their sons, Albert, Paul and Ralph. The family originated in Hungary, where she was born and where her husband distributed and exported eggs. Concerned about a possible Soviet invasion of Hungary in the 1920's, the strictly Orthodox Jewish family immigrated to Austria. By the time Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, Samuel Reichmann had bought a failing glass factory and made it profitable. Realizing that life in Austria would soon become unsafe, he moved the family to Tangier, Morocco, where he established a major banking house. Family Moves to Canada In the 1950's, the family again moved, this time to Canada. Now joined in business by his sons, Samuel Reichmann founded Olympia & York, for which Mrs. Reichmann served as a director. The business is still family owned and is a major power in North American real estate. The Reichmanns bought eight office skyscrapers in Manhattan, including 2 Broadway, 55 Water Street and 245 Park Avenue, and today Olympia & York ranks as the largest private owner of commercial property in the city. They also own 38 percent of the Campeau Corporation, the troubled Canadian conglomerate that owns Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus and other American retail chains. The Reichmanns are considered to be among the world's 10 wealthiest families, with business assets estimated at more than $7 billion. Samuel Reichmann died in 1975. Mrs. Reichmann is survived by five sons, Albert, Paul and Ralph, all of Toronto; Edward of Jerusalem, and Lewis of Manhattan."

Donald, 67, Klan Foe","Beulah Mae Donald, who won a $7 million judgment against the Ku Klux Klan for the death of her son in a beating, died of natural causes Saturday at a hospital in Mobile, according to the Mobile County Coroner, Leroy Riddick.","MOBILE, Ala., Sept. 19 Beulah Mae Donald, who won a $7 million judgment against the Ku Klux Klan for the death of her son in a beating, died of natural causes Saturday at a hospital in Mobile, according to the Mobile County Coroner, Leroy Riddick. She was 67 years old. ''She'll forever have a place in history as the woman who beat the Klan,'' said Morris Dees, who was the chief attorney for the family. The Donalds are black. Mrs. Donald's son, Michael, was strangled and fatally beaten in Baldwin County and his body found hanging from a tree in a neighborhood in Mobile. Two Ku Klux Klansmen were convicted in the case. On Feb. 12, 1987, a jury awarded the family a $7 million judgment against the Klan. The United Klans of America's national headquarters building in Tuscaloosa, its only asset, was later signed over to the estate of Michael Donald and sold for an undisclosed amount. It had been appraised at $150,000 to $200,000. ''I just think she was a brave and courageous mother whose love for her son insured that he did not die in vain,'' said Mr. Dees, who is director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery. Last December, Mrs. Donald was named one of Ms. Magazine's 1987 Women of the Year. Shortly after receiving the honor, Mrs. Donald said she never sought revenge. 'I Wanted to Know' ''I wanted to know who all really killed my child,'' she said. ''I wasn't even thinking about the money. If I hadn't gotten a cent, it wouldn't have mattered. I wanted to know how and why they did it.'' Her son, who was 19, was kidnapped from a Mobile street in March 1981 and taken to a rural area where he was beaten and choked. His throat was cut and his body was hanged from a tree. Henry Francis Hays has been sentenced to die in Alabama's electric chair for Michael Donald's murder and James L. Knowles is serving a life sentence in a Federal prison. He pleaded guilty to violating Donald's civil rights. Both were members of the Ku Klux Klan. The United States Supreme Court refused to hear Mr. Hays's appeal of his capital murder conviction in February. In the same month a mistrial was declared in the trial of two alleged accomplices, Bennie Jack Hays and Benjamin Franklin Cox, after Bennie Hays collapsed in court. Mrs. Donald's survivors include four daughters: Mary A. Houston of Jackson, Miss.; and Cecelia Perry, Cynthia Mitchell and Betty J. Wyatt, all of Mobile, and two sons, Stanley Donald of Biloxi, Miss., and Leo Donald of Detroit."

31748,"Lydia Csato Gasman, Picasso Scholar, Dies at 84","Lydia Csato Gasman, an art historian known for her groundbreaking scholarship on the work of Picasso, died on Jan. 15 in Charlottesville, Va. She was 84 and lived in Charlottesville.","Lydia Csato Gasman, an art historian known for her groundbreaking scholarship on the work of Picasso, died on Jan. 15 in Charlottesville, Va. She was 84 and lived in Charlottesville. Her death was confirmed by Larry Goedde, chairman of the McIntire Department of Art at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she taught for two decades. Fluent in several languages and equipped with a formidable memory, Dr. Gasman redefined Picasso studies. Most scholars had either analyzed Picasso's art purely in terms of formal innovations and aesthetic progress or offered one-dimensional readings of his work in relation to his life story. Dr. Gasman found a middle way. One of her more sensational achievements was to track down Marie-Therese Walter, the great love of Picasso's life, in the south of France in 1972 and, over a period of several days, to conduct the frankest, most detailed interview about their life together. But Dr. Gasman's most far-reaching accomplishment was to tie the imagery of Picasso's paintings to the life of his mind: his reading (especially the poetry of the Surrealists), his own writings and notebook jottings, his psychic state and his interests in all forms of mysticism, magic and ritual. She introduced her findings in the sprawling four-volume dissertation for her Ph.D., which she earned from Columbia University in 1981. ''Mystery, Magic, and Love in Picasso, 1925-1938: Picasso and the Surrealist Poets'' delved into arcana like Picasso's interest in the Masons and their use of ritual objects; the sexual significance of the beach cabana, a frequent motif in his paintings of the 1930s; and his belief in the magical nature of the art and artifacts of so-called primitive cultures, especially African. It devoted 75 pages alone to the images of severed rams' heads in Picasso's painting and the underlying theme of sacrifice. Although never published, Dr. Gasman's dissertation, photocopies of which were available for purchase, was required reading in some art history departments and was regularly mined by other scholars and writers on Picasso, who all too frequently failed to credit her discoveries. John Richardson, Picasso's principal biographer, has said that Dr. Gasman did ''more to unlock the secrets of the artist's imagination than anyone else.'' Luanne McKinnon, a former graduate student of Dr. Gasman's at the University of Virginia and now director of the University of New Mexico Art Museum, said, ''Lydia's in-depth reading of Picasso is in the air and water of the field, so to speak.'' Lydia Csato was born on May 28, 1925, in Focsani, Romania, to a prosperous, cultured family. She received degrees from the University of Bucharest in 1948 and the Academy of Fine Arts in Bucharest in 1953 and went on to become an award-winning Social Realist painter in Romania before escaping to the West in 1961. She first went to Israel, joining family members who had migrated years earlier, and then to Paris. There, seeing modernist art in depth for the first time, she became enthralled with Picasso's work. In 1963 she married Daniel Gasman, a historian of science, and they soon moved to New York. They divorced in 2000, but remained close. She is survived by her brother, Joash Tsiddon of Tel Aviv, a former member of the Knesset. Dr. Gasman was a strong, charismatic personality whom publishers often found difficult to work with despite their interest in her work. Her last book, ''War and the Cosmos in Picasso's Texts, 1936-1940,'' was published in 2007 by a vanity press. Dr. Gasman, who continued to paint, taught art history at Vassar College from 1968 to 1973 and at the University of Haifa in Israel from 1973 to 1975. From 1981 until her retirement in 2001, she was on the faculty of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where her impassioned lectures often drew standing-room-only audiences. Her classroom attire might include fishnet stockings, turbans and a leopard skin skirt. And, always, she smoked a cigarette. Dr. Gasman contributed to the catalogs of several Picasso exhibitions, including ''Picasso and the War Years: 1937 to 1945,'' at the Guggenheim Museum in 1999. Her essay ''Death Falling From the Sky: Picasso's Wartime Texts'' focuses on the notebooks Picasso kept during his 11-month stay in Royan on the coast of France after Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939. It parses the visceral characterizations of air raids in his notebooks; traces specific word choices -- he referred to bombs as partridges -- back through his life, and through culture in general; and notes his use in collages of newspaper articles about the war. The result is a heightened sense of the connection among Picasso's often feverish writing, the convoluted forms of his paintings and his agitated brushwork. In Royan, Dr. Gasman concluded, ''there are moments when Picasso distinctly conceived writing as a substitute for painting and painting as a form of writing.''"
14595,SENATOR HENRY M. JACKSON IS DEAD AT 71,"Senator Henry M. Jackson, the Washington Democrat who served in Congress for more than half of this century, ran for President twice and was regarded as one of the nation's leading voices on military affairs, died Thursday night in Everett, Wash., after suffering a massive heart attack.","WASHINGTON, Sept. 2 Senator Henry M. Jackson, the Washington Democrat who served in Congress for more than half of this century, ran for President twice and was regarded as one of the nation's leading voices on military affairs, died Thursday night in Everett, Wash., after suffering a massive heart attack. He was 71 years old. Mr. Jackson died hours after he called a news conference in Everett to deplore the downing of a South Korean airliner by a Soviet fighter plane. Senator Jackson's death signaled the end of a political era in his home state of Washington and altered the political landscape of Capitol Hill. It gives Gov. John Spellman, a Republican, an opportunity to make a temporary appointment that will increase the Republicans' majority in the Senate. The death also and removed a staunch advocate of military preparedness nine days after Senator John Tower, a Texas Republican who is another leading supporter of the military, announced that he would not seek re- election next year. Arms, McCarthy, Soviet Jews In nearly 43 years in Congress, Mr. Jackson was involved in the major themes of American political life, from the issues of the early years of the nuclear age to the arcane details of strategic arms treaties, and from the drama of the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954 to efforts in the 1970's to the freedom for Soviet Jews. Senator Jackson died less than an hour after he was taken to Providence Hospital, only a dozen blocks from his home in Everett. The Senator, who had been considered in good health and was known as an energetic man, had just returned from a two-week trip to China and talks with Chinese leaders. Shortly before President Reagan left California this morning to return to Washington, he said he and Mrs. Reagan were ''deeply saddened'' to hear of Senator Jackson's death. ''He was a friend, colleague, a true patriot, and a devoted servant of the people,'' Mr. Reagan said. Sought Out by Presidents Mr. Jackson was John F. Kennedy's choice to head the Democratic National Committee in 1960. Presidents of both parties sought his counsel, particularly on military and diplomatic matters. Over the years, he defended Adm. Hyman G. Rickover and the nuclear submarine; he spoke out for the survival of Israel; he strove to win military contracts for the Boeing Company, his state's largest employer. He was a strenuous supporter of organized labor and civil rights. In the last decade he emerged as a leader of a strain of Democrats committed to a strong national defense and skeptical of their party's impulses in foreign affairs. These Democrats, some of whom called themselves neoconservatives, often regarded Mr. Jackson as the symbol of the party's traditional center. They supported him vigorously when he campaigned for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1972 and 1976. Remembrances by Colleagues Mr. Jackson suffered a string of primary defeats in the 1972 race, but in 1976 he won important victories in the Massachusetts and New York primaries before his campaign languished. In later years he confined his energies to the Senate, concentrating on his role in the Senate Armed Services Committee and urging colleagues to resist the entreaties of the political action committees that proliferated in the wake of the campaign financing laws prompted by the Watergate scandals. His death brought expressions of sadness and tributes from Democratic and Republican colleagues. Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader, termed Mr. Jackson ''a seasoned politician who understood the need for bipartisan cooperation on issues of vital national interest.'' Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, characterized him as a ''great statesman'' and ''guiding force for democracy'' who ''never wavered in his dedication to the true principles of peace, liberty and freedom.'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that he felt a ''deep and personal loss'' and added, ''The Senate has lost one of its great leaders.'' 'Labor Had No Stauncher Friend' Senator Jackson's death was also seen as a loss for the labor movement, which had given him considerable support in his Presidential campaigns. ''Labor had no stauncher friend,'' said Lane Kirkland, the president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. ''He shared our commitment to social and economic justice and to a strong national defense adequate to protect those values against totalitarians of the left or the right.'' Henry Martin Jackson was born in Everett May 31, 1912, the son of Norwegian immigrants. His father was a building contractor, his mother a devoutly religious woman, and on the wood-plank streets of his hometown the young Henry Jackson drew from their examples of hard work and demands for achievement. As a newspaper delivery boy he once set a record by delivering 74,880 copies of The Everett Herald without a single complaint. Sister Named Him 'Scoop' His sister called him ''Scoop'' because she thought he resembled a character in a cartoon strip and the name remained with him, even on the floor of the Senate. At Everett High School he managed the basketball team and was a member of the debating team. He earned his way through college, graduating from the University of Washington and taking a law degree there. As a young lawyer, he became a prosecutor in Snohomish County and won a reputation as a foe of prostitutes, slot machine operators and bootleggers. Mr. Jackson was a vigorous supporter of President Roosevelt, catapulted into prominence by his success as a prosecutor, Mr. Jackson was to Congress in 1940. He was 28 years old and one of the youngest members of the House. He became something of a specialist in nuclear energy and military affairs. He was re-elected five times before he challenged the Republican incumbent Harry P. Cain in 1952 for a Senate seat. He won a plurality of 135,000 votes. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Presidential candidate, took Washington State by more than 100,000 votes. Thus began a tenure of three decades as his state's junior senator. Mr. Jackson and Warren G. Magnuson, who was elected to the Senate in 1944 and served until he was unseated in 1980 by Slade Gorton, a Republican, made up perhaps the most formidable team in the Senate. Together, ''Maggie and Scoop,'' as they were called, accumulated 64 years of Senate seniority by 1980. They played decisive roles, Mr. Magnuson as chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, Mr. Jackson as an expert in armed services issues. ''We worked together so many years for the benefit of the state and nation,'' Mr. Magnuson, who is 78 years old, said today. ''We were in intimate contact. We were in so many contests together on the same side.'' The Jackson Personal Style In manner Mr. Jackson was quiet, contemplative, a bit ascetic, and just short of unfashionable in his demeanor. But in many ways he was a political figure from the old school. It was the new force in politics, television, that put him on the national stage. In 1954, a year after he and two other Democrats, Senators Stuart Symington of Missouri and John L. McClellan of Arkansas, left the Permanent Investigations Subcommittee, Mr. Jackson charged that the committee was ''hunting headlines instead of hunting Communists,'' in part because of a dispute over committee staffing and in part as a protest against the techniques of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican of Wisconsin. But he and the others returned to the committee, and as television sent the Army-McCarthy hearings across the nation, Mr. Jackson came across as sober and fair-minded, by one account a ''clean-cut James Stewart type.'' The hearings were an outgrowth of Senator McCarthy's charges of Communist infiltration of the Army. Mr. Jackson voted for the censure of Senator McCarthy in late 1954. He became a leading critic of the military policies of the Eisenhower Administration. He pointed out deficiencies in the nation's infant missile program and spoke out in favor of the nuclear submarine ideas advanced by Admiral Rickover. Key Party Role, Then Marriage In 1960, Senator John F. Kennedy considered Mr. Jackson for the Vice Presidential nomination that eventually was given to Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas. Shortly afterward Kennedy, who had pledged to select a Protestant to head the party, chose Senator Jackson to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee. A year later, Mr. Jackson, a regular on Washington society writers' lists of bachelors, married Helen Eugenia Hardin of Albuquerque, who was working in the office of Senator Clinton P. Anderson of New Mexico. Mr. Jackson was a longtime supporter of American involvement in Southeast Asia. In 1962 he urged that the United States ''draw the line'' in Laos. Later, though he muted his views on Vietnam as the nation grew weary of American involvement there, and even voted against President Ford's request in 1975 for emergency aid for the deteriorating Government of South Vietnam, Senator Jackson retained his belief that the United States had been correct in entering the Vietnam War. ''The basic decision to go into Vietnam was right,'' he said in April 1975, when such a position was unfashionable. He also was a leading advocate of the antimissile missile, arguing that the Soviet Union was a ''dangerous, unpredictable opponent.'' He held up approval of the first treaty on limiting strategic arms, insisting that future treaties not limit the United States to missile levels inferior to those of the Soviet Union. He was perhaps the most vociferous Democratic opponent of the second strategic arms pact. Defense and Conservation Through his years in the capital, Mr. Jackson's commitment to the national defense has been coupled with his dedication to winning military contracts for Boeing. He was sometimes referred to in the capital as ''the Senator from Boeing,'' which he resented bitterly. He was, however, criticized for permitting a Boeing lobbyist to operate out of his Senate office in the unsuccessful battle for a Federal subsidy to build the supersonic transport plane. The aircraft failed to win Congress's support. Senator Jackson's support of the measure angered some conservationists. But he regarded himself as a protector of the environment and was identified with Congressional battles over strip mining and land-use questions. He was a major architect of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the first modern statement of the nation's environmental goals. It created the Environmental Protection Agency. Senator Jackson won perhaps his greatest attention for his efforts in behalf of Israel and Soviet Jews. He dated his repugnance to anti-Semitism to lectures from his mother. He solidified his support for the survival of Israel after a visit to a Nazi concentration camp. Easing Curbs to Free Jews In 1974 he prevailed in persuading Congress to tie an easing of trade barriers to provide freer passage of Jews out of the Soviet Union. The arrangement collapsed a year later, but it won Mr. Jackson the support of many influential American Jews. Today, Howard I. Friedman, president of the American Jewish Committee, said Mr. Jackson was ''a man whose name will ever be associated with American legislation that already has helped more than a quarter of a million Jews emigrate from the Soviet Union to freedom.'' Although his two Presidential campaigns failed to win widespread support, Mr. Jackson, one of the last remaining New Dealers in Washington, remained an influential figure on Capitol Hill. Late this spring he was the leading voice in the successful effort to limit the amount of honorariums given Senators. ''There is growing and, I think, justifiable criticism that this has undermined the integrity of the Senate,'' said Mr. Jackson, who for years donated all his income from honorariums to charity. ''This is a scandal waiting to happen.'' Jackson Urged Latin Panel Less than a week later, Mr. Jackson, along with Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland, urged President Reagan to appoint a commission on Central America, an idea that took form in Mr. Reagan's special commission on Central America. Mr. Jackson was a member of the Board of Overseers of both Harvard University and Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., and a member of the Board of Advisers for the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard. He was also a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution. In addition to his wife, Mr. Jackson is survived by a daughter, Anna Marie Jackson, a student at Stanford University, and a son, Peter Hardin Jackson, a student at the St. Alban's School in Washington. Memorial services are to be held Tuesday evening in Washington's National Cathedral and in the Everett Civic Auditorium, Everett, Wash. A private service for the family and for a Congressional delegation is scheduled for noon Wednesday in the First Presbyterian Church in Everett."

He was 82. The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Anita Menfi Alger, also a family therapist. Dr. Alger was one of a small group of therapists who applied psychoanalysis, Freud's one-on-one therapy, to family and couple relationships. In group sessions he would guide interactions among several family members in order to detect patterns that were disruptive, subconscious and often rooted in adults' own earliest relationships. In 1965, when Sony introduced its half-inch reel-to-reel video recorder, he and a close colleague, Dr. Peter Hogan, decided to use it -- with patients' permission -- as part of the therapy, so people could see body language and other subtle reactions. Patients' reactions could be ''almost immediate,'' said Dr. Andrew J. Gerber, a psychiatrist at Columbia and former student of Dr. Alger's. For example, in one of Dr. Gerber's sessions, with a married couple, Dr. Alger sat in and recorded a nervous tapping habit of the wife's. He later played the tape back, explaining the tic's likely effect on the couple's interaction. ''Dr. Alger's innovation of incorporating video recordings really helped our field move forward,'' Ronald J. Chenail, a professor of family therapy at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale and editor of the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, said in an email. ''In much the same way as a coach will review recordings of athletic events to note particular patterns, Dr. Alger's insight led psychotherapists to do much the same thing in their research and practice.'' Ian Ewart Alger was born on June 20, 1926, in Oshawa, Ontario, the only child of Ewart Alger, who ran a local newspaper, and Greta Alger. He graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in medicine in 1949, and completed his residency in psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital/ NYU Medical Center. After two years working at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine in New York, he served in the Army as psychiatrist at Letterman Army Hospital in San Francisco, before returning to New York to complete training in psychoanalysis and start his own practice. He held appointments at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Weill Cornell Medical College. From the mid-1950s through the late 1990s, Dr. Alger published widely in journals on the effect of using video in therapy. He participated in the first Veterans' Administration Satellite Telemedicine broadcast, anticipated the use of virtual reality in therapy, and devised an unusual method to illuminate emotional conflicts: on a split screen, patients saw two profiles of their own face, one recorded from the left side and the other from the right -- the two ''faces'' embodying contrary urges, Dr. Alger argued. Dr. Alger's first wife, Elizabeth Joyce, died several years ago. In addition to Ms. Menfi Alger, he is survived by four children from his first marriage, Derek and Timothy, of New Jersey, Wendy, of Barrie, Ontario, and Penelope Kohut of Andover, Mass.; and three grandchildren. Dr. Robert R. Rynearson, a psychiatrist at Texas A&M Medical School, said in a telephone interview that at a workshop he saw Dr. Alger demonstrate the dramatic effect of video. After a husband in one session denied that he had been angry with his wife, he watched himself on tape -- and acknowledged that in fact he had been mad. ''Men believe what they see on television,'' Dr. Alger said."

7465,"Clair George, Spy and Iran-Contra Figure, Dies at 81","Clair E. George, a consummate spymaster who moved the chess pieces in the Central Intelligence Agency's clandestine games of intrigue before being convicted of lying to Congress about the Iran-contra affair, died Aug. 11 in Bethesda, Md.","Clair E. George, a consummate spymaster who moved the chess pieces in the Central Intelligence Agency's clandestine games of intrigue before being convicted of lying to Congress about the Iran-contra affair, died Aug. 11 in Bethesda, Md. He was 81. The cause was cardiac arrest, said his sister, Gail Marshall. Before Mr. George was sentenced, the first President George Bush granted a full and unconditional pardon to him and five other Iran-contra defendants. As the C.I.A.'s deputy director of operations for three years of the Reagan administration, the third-highest post in the spy agency, Mr. George was responsible for cloak-and-dagger activities worldwide. He reached this pinnacle after three decades of working as a spy around the world, specializing in recruiting foreign agents to spy on their own countries for the United States. The Washington Post Magazine in 1992 quoted a colleague as calling Mr. George ''a top-notch street man'' who operated in what spies call the ''night soil circuit'' -- the less desirable posts of the world. He worked in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. He was the C.I.A.'s station chief in Beirut when civil war erupted there in 1975. He then volunteered to replace the Athens station chief, who had just been assassinated by terrorists. Bob Woodward, in his 1987 book, ''Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987,'' said veteran spies regarded Mr. George as ''an old warhorse symbol of the C.I.A. at its best and proudest.'' In The Post, Richard Viets, a Foreign Service officer who was in India at the same time as Mr. George and who went on to become an ambassador, said Mr. George had the perfect personality for the agency. ''He exudes trust and friendliness,'' he said, ''but in fact is duplicitous as hell.'' Mr. George's loyalty to the C.I.A., however, was unshakable -- and ultimately wrecked his career. He was convicted in 1992 of lying to Congressional committees and a grand jury to keep from disclosing what he knew about the agency's participation in the Reagan administration's illegal scheme to sell arms to Iran and divert profits from the sales to help the contra rebels in Nicaragua. Mr. George was the highest-ranking C.I.A. officer prosecuted by the independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh in what came to be known as the Iran-contra affair. After a mistrial caused by a hung jury, Mr. George was convicted of two charges of false statements and perjury before Congress. He faced a maximum penalty of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines on each count. Mr. George said that his conscience was clear and that he felt like ''a pawn in a continuous drama of political exploitation.'' Earlier, he had explained that he had been ''almost megalomaniacal'' in striving to use his testimony to Congress to ''protect the agency.'' Mr. Walsh wrote that the verdict refuted the view that the illegal operation had been confined to the White House and showed that it in fact extended to various agencies, like the Defense and State Departments, as well as the C.I.A. He said that if Mr. George had told the truth to Congress, the wrongdoing could have been stopped years sooner. Suspicions had been raised in October 1986, when an American cargo plane ferrying arms to Nicaraguan rebels was shot down. ''George chose to evade, mislead and lie,'' Mr. Walsh said. Mr. George had been indicted in September 1991, partly on the strength of the testimony of an aide who told prosecutors that Mr. George had told him to withhold information from Congress. However, his devotion to the C.I.A. was appreciated by agency employees and retirees, who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for his defense and came to his trial to show support. Some volunteered to pore through mountains of classified material assembled for the trial in search of useful evidence. Some suggested that President Ronald Reagan should have been the one on trial, saying that in professing ignorance of Iran-contra, the president was either lying or admitting that he had been asleep at the switch. But investigations by Mr. Walsh, Congress and an independent commission could not pin responsibility on the president. Clair Elroy George was born in Pittsburgh on Aug. 3, 1930. His family moved several times, ending up in Beaver Falls, Pa., when he was 9. His father was a dairy chemist who worked for the federal Department of Agriculture. As a youth, Mr. George was a drummer in local dance bands and president of the high school student council and worked in a steel mill. He majored in political science and debated at Pennsylvania State University, graduating in 1952. He enrolled in Columbia Law School, but joined the Army instead. He learned Chinese and worked in counterintelligence in the Army in Japan. He joined the C.I.A. after being impressed by agency officers he met in the Far East. After numerous assignments, in Washington and abroad, he returned to Washington for good in 1979. He placed first out of 100 candidates in a promotions ranking and was put in charge of the agency's African division. William J. Casey, whom Reagan had named director of central intelligence, appointed Mr. George to successively higher positions. He served as deputy director from 1984 until his retirement in 1987. He then worked as a consultant. Mr. George's wife, the former Mary Atkinson, died in 2008. In addition to his sister, he is survived by his daughters, Leslie George and Ann Davies, and three grandchildren. During Mr. George's trial, the defense repeatedly tried to inform the jury of his espionage achievements, which prosecutors tried to quash because they might impress jurors. Finally, Judge Royce C. Lamberth told prosecutors they could admit ''something equivalent to war-hero status'' and leave it at that."

He was 42. His wife, Louise, found him hanged in his garage, the police said, and the death was being treated as a suicide. The BBC reported that Speed had suffered from depression. Speed took charge of Wales last December, and although the team failed to qualify for next summer's European Football Championship in Poland and Ukraine, its world ranking jumped to No. 45 from a low of No. 117 after three consecutive victories. In building the Wales squad, Speed brought in talented young players like Gareth Bale as it prepared for qualifying matches for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He was also a sought-after television pundit who had appeared on the BBC show ''Football Focus'' on Saturday. He began his professional career at 19, when he made his debut for Leeds United in the old First Division of English soccer. He was part of a dynamic midfield, including Gordon Strachan, David Batty and Gary McAllister, that in 1991-92 took Leeds to the last championship before the formation of the Premier League. In addition to playing for Leeds, Speed spent time with Everton, Newcastle United, Bolton and Sheffield United, becoming the first to play 500 games (535 in all) in the Premier League. Internationally, Speed made 85 appearances for Wales, second only to goalkeeper Neville Southall. He retired from international play in 2004 when Wales failed to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. Wales, though part of Britain, maintains a national team, as do Scotland and Northern Ireland. Wales has not qualified in a generation for top international tournaments like the World Cup and the European Championship.

In addition to his wife, his survivors include two teenage sons, Tommy and Ed. ''He completely transformed the Welsh situation from one of despair to one of hope and expectation,'' his former Wales teammate Mark Bowen told The Guardian. ''The players liked him and had a real bond with him that showed in games. Everyone was really excited.''"

18783,"David Carliner, 89, Lawyer And Immigration Advocate","David Carliner, an influential left-leaning lawyer whose work for clients ranging from scholars and scoundrels to cooks and cabdrivers helped define modern immigration law, died Wednesday in Washington.","David Carliner, an influential left-leaning lawyer whose work for clients ranging from scholars and scoundrels to cooks and cabdrivers helped define modern immigration law, died Wednesday in Washington. He was 89. The cause was a heart attack, his grandson Jacob Remes said. Mr. Carliner was also a driving force behind achieving home rule for the District of Columbia, the chairman of a human rights group now called Global Rights and a founder of the Washington chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Carliner's legal legacy emerged from the cases he took on. One was that of Carlos Marcello, the New Orleans racketeer whom the federal government deported in 1961. Another client, Staughton Lynd, was a Yale professor whose passport was canceled after he made an unauthorized trip to North Vietnam when the United States was at war with that country. His representation of a Chinese immigrant, Hay Say Naim, in a complicated case involving Virginia's anti-miscegenation law drew national attention in the early 1950s. In 1979 and 1980, Mr. Carliner fought legal battles for Iranian students studying in the United States who were trapped between the new fundamentalist government in their own country and the American authorities. In the 1980s, he separately represented a self-acknowledged member of a death squad in El Salvador and a Nicaraguan illegal immigrant who feared being drafted by the Sandinista government if forced to return to his own country. When Garry Davis returned from 30 years of wanderings using a world passport he had issued himself, Mr. Carliner won him the right to live in the United States. But Mr. Carliner's battles were part of an overall effort to change and liberalize immigration policy. He fought the Reagan administration's efforts to restrict the power of federal courts in immigration and asylum cases and in the 1990s campaigned against Congressional efforts to tighten immigration severely. In 1977, he published ''Rights of Aliens,'' which became a popular handbook on changes in immigration policy. In 1990, he and several colleagues came out with ''The Rights of Aliens and Refugees,'' (Southern Illinois University Press). Abraham David Carliner was born on Aug. 13, 1918, in Washington. His father bought, operated and sold grocery stores. His own anti-authoritarian streak emerged as a teenager when he led a protest against the cancellation of a football game after a fight in a previous game. He told his grandson he did not even like football. ''I was just trying to make trouble,'' Mr. Carliner told him. In 1934, when he was 16, he was arrested outside the German embassy, where he was protesting Nazism. He attended American University, the University of Virginia and National University, where he earned his law degree. In 1954, National University merged with George Washington University. forming what became the National Law Center of George Washington University. While a student in Virginia, Mr. Carliner joined with the activist Virginia Durr and others to fight the poll tax and other elements of racial discrimination in the South. He enlisted in the Army in 1941 and completed Officer Training School. Years later he told his family he had been denied a commission because of his left-wing politics. Not all of Mr. Carliner's cases involved immigration. In 1964, he represented a vending company against Robert G. Baker, the Senate aide and longtime friend of President Lyndon B. Johnson, in a dispute over a commercial contract. The case, which drew wide publicity, was settled out of court. In 1965, Mr. Carliner represented Bruce C. Scott, a federal employee who sued the government after being fired for being gay. He won the landmark case in the United States Court of Appeals in Washington. In 1967, he led the successful drive to get a mayor and a city council for Washington. Although he expressed discontent at the time over the limited nature of this ''home rule,'' it culminated a fight he had begun as a young man. Mr. Carliner's wife, the former Miriam Kalter, died in 1994. He is survived by their son, Geoffrey, of Newton, Mass.; their daughter, Deborah Carliner of Washington; four grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter. In 1993, Mr. Carliner, as an expert on immigration, was asked about Judge Kimba M. Wood's hiring of an illegal immigrant as a baby sitter. He said that in his opinion Judge Wood, President Bill Clinton's nominee as attorney general, had violated no law because she had hired her nanny eight months before the law prohibiting such hiring went into effect. But the judge had already withdrawn her name."

Y. He was 72 and lived in Croton, N. Y. The cause of death was cancer, Unicef officials said. Mr. Grant resigned from the United Nations Children's Fund last week. The direction and urgency he gave to Unicef have widely been credited with helping to save millions of children's lives. Mr. Grant, who had also been an Under Secretary General of the United Nations, was still traveling and promoting his ""child survival revolution"" until late last year. His message was simple: low-cost, practical methods for saving young lives and curtailing the spread of easily preventible diseases can quickly make a difference. He advocated treating diarrhea, a leading killer of children, with doses of water, sugar and salt that village people could make themselves. To measure the successes and sometimes the failures of Unicef and the countries it assisted, Mr. Grant introduced an annual report, ""The State of the World's Children,"" now in its 15th year. In 1990, he organized the World Summit for Children, which he considered a highlight of his career. The conference, held in New York, established 27 child health and welfare goals that were later incorporated into national planning in more than 100 countries. In a statement after Mr. Grant's death, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said: ""Very few men or women ever have the opportunity to do as much good in the world as James Grant. And very few have ever grasped that opportunity with such complete and dedicated commitment."" In 1994, Mr. Grant received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Clinton, who cited him for his ""compassion and courage in his crusade for the world's children."" Mr. Grant was born in Beijing on May 12, 1922, the son of a public health expert working in Asia. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and earned a law degree at Harvard. He began a lifelong career in international service in the 1940's, working with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in China. In 1962 he became Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs and a deputy director of the International Cooperation Administration, a precursor of the United States Agency for International Development. In 1964, he moved to Turkey to head the American aid mission there. Three years later, Mr. Grant was appointed an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, serving until 1969, when he helped found the Overseas Development Council and became its president and chief executive officer. He remained there until moving to Unicef in 1980. In 1943, Mr. Grant married Ethel Henck. The couple had three sons, John, James and William. His wife died of a heart attack in 1988 on a trip in India. In 1989 he married Ellan W. Young, a photographer. He is survived by his wife, his sons and five grandchildren."

He was 80. The cause was complications of a heart attack, as reported on Mr. Pavic's Web site, www.khazars.com/en. An academic whose field, perhaps unsurprisingly, was philosophy, Mr. Pavic taught for many years at the University of Belgrade. Dreamlike, playful and formally unorthodox, his novels were like hardbound hypertext in their insistence on offering readers alternate, nonlinear ways of navigating a story. His approach made him a lineal descendant of nonlinear novelists like Cervantes, Laurence Sterne and Jorge Luis Borges. Mr. Pavic's narratives do away with the forced-march, page-after-page strategy to which most readers are accustomed. They are profuse with self-reference, unreliable narration, authorial asides and ''Rashomon''-like shifts in point of view. Stories nest within stories like the pieces of a Russian doll. His most famous novel was his first, ''Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel in 100,000 Words'' (Knopf, 1988; translated by Christina Pribicevic-Zoric). Often compared to the work of Umberto Eco, the novel ostensibly centers on the Khazars, a real-life Turkic people who had largely disappeared by the 11th century. Organized like a dictionary -- entries, which the reader is encouraged to peruse at random, include ''Dream Hunters,'' ''Khazar Polemic'' and ''Betrothal Contract of Samuel Cohen and Lidisia Sarouk'' -- the book ranges over large historical, philosophical and theological questions as it tells (or does not) the story of the Khazars and what became of them. It can also be read (or not) as an allegory of the turmoil that has roiled the Balkans for centuries. The novel, which purports to be the republication of a late-17th-century dictionary printed in poison ink, opens encouragingly: ''The author assures the reader that he will not have to die if he reads this book, as did the user of the 1691 edition, when 'The Khazar Dictionary' still had it first scribe.'' Mr. Pavic's next novel, ''Landscape Painted With Tea'' (Knopf, 1990; translated by Ms. Pribicevic-Zoric), is partly organized as a crossword puzzle, with alternating sections titled ''Across'' and ''Down.'' Readers may approach the book chronologically by reading only the ''Across'' sections, or less chronologically and with more digressions by reading the ''Down'' sections. Either strategy gradually reveals the story of a soul-searching architect who roams a labyrinth of meditation and memory. As he wrote in the novel, Mr. Pavic built his fiction the way he did as a spur to ''the reader who opts for the old way of reading, for the one-way street, the reader who is determined to slide toward death by the shortest route, without putting up a fight -- in other"

He was 85. The cause was a heart attack after a short illness, said Phyllis Anscombe, his sister-in-law. Mr. Tukey developed important theories about how to analyze data and compute series of numbers quickly. He spent decades as both a professor at Princeton University and a researcher at AT&T's Bell Laboratories, and his ideas continue to be a part of both doctoral statistics courses and high school math classes. In 1973, President Richard M. Nixon awarded him the National Medal of Science. But Mr. Tukey frequently ventured outside of the academy as well, working as a consultant to the government and corporations and taking part in social debates. In the 1950's, he criticized Alfred C. Kinsey's research on sexual behavior. In the 1970's, he was chairman of a research committee that warned that aerosol spray cans damaged the ozone layer. More recently, he recommended that the 1990 Census be adjusted by using statistical formulas in order to count poor urban residents whom he believed it had missed. ""The best thing about being a statistician,"" Mr. Tukey once told a colleague, ""is that you get to play in everyone's backyard."" An intense man who liked to argue and was fond of helping other researchers, Mr. Tukey was also an amateur linguist who made significant contributions to the language of modern times. In a 1958 article in American Mathematical Monthly, he became the first person to define the programs on which electronic calculators ran, said Fred R. Shapiro, a librarian at Yale Law School who is editing a book on the origin of terms. Three decades before the founding of Microsoft, Mr. Tukey saw that ""software,"" as he called it, was gaining prominence. ""Today,"" he wrote at the time, it is ""at least as important"" as the "" 'hardware' of tubes, transistors, wires, tapes and the like."" Twelve years earlier, while working at Bell Laboratories, he had coined the term ""bit,"" an abbreviation of ""binary digit"" that described the 1's and 0's that are the basis of computer programs.

Fontana, a national voice for abused and neglected children and the longtime medical director of the New York Foundling, the service agency for such children and their families, died on Tuesday while vacationing on Block Island, R.I.","Dr. Vincent J. Fontana, a national voice for abused and neglected children and the longtime medical director of the New York Foundling, the service agency for such children and their families, died on Tuesday while vacationing on Block Island, R.I. He was 81 and lived in Stony Brook, N.Y. The cause was not given, and his death occurred suddenly, according to a statement from the New York Foundling. The previous week, Dr. Fontana had attended a fund-raising golf outing and taken part in a seminar on child protection at the Greenwich Village center named in his honor. Over a half century, Dr. Fontana helped define the problems and magnitude of child neglect in this country. He wrote books and many articles on the subject, and in 1959 became the medical director and principal pediatrician of what was then the New York Foundling Hospital. The institution is the successor to the New York Foundling Asylum begun by two nuns in 1869 in the wake of the Civil War; it changed its name to Foundling Hospital in 1891 and eventually evolved into the Foundling, a social service agency serving thousands of people, from newborns to adults. In his long career, Dr. Fontana also served as personal physician to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Cardinal Francis Spellman of New York. His work provided guidelines for saving children through similar initiatives across the country. Part of his legacy was the Vincent J. Fontana Center for Child Protection, an adjunct of the Foundling that he started in 1998. The center, relocated into a converted four-story school building on Christopher Street last November, complemented a variety of shelters he had organized since the early 1970's. It houses a conference center, an education center and psychiatric and psychological services. Dr. Fontana, a trained pediatrician, started the center to further the understanding and detection of child abuse and neglect, and to teach their prevention and treatment. Close by is another Foundling branch, Our Place, a clinic for children who fall victim to severe sexual and physical abuse. He was involved in manifold programs of foster care and adoption services, prenatal care for expectant young mothers and the like, and his innovative approaches set a pattern for other institutions. His books included titles like ''Practical Management of the Allergic Child'' and ''Somewhere a Child Is Crying.'' His classic text, ''The Maltreated Child: The Maltreatment Syndrome in Children: a Medical, Legal and Social Guide,'' written with Douglas J. Besharov, came out in 1964 and remains in print. Vincent James Fontana was born in New York City on Nov. 19, 1923. He received his medical degree from Long Island College of Medicine in 1947 and trained in obstetrics and pediatrics. He completed his studies in pediatric allergy at N.Y.U. in 1952 before serving in the Medical Corps at the Naval Hospital, Bethesda, during the Korean War. At that time he was a personal physician to both the Secretary of the Navy and to President Eisenhower whenever he spent time at the Camp David retreat. After leaving the service in 1954, Dr. Fontana returned to New York to practice on his own and became a Cardinal Spellman's doctor. He was appointed medical director of Foundling Hospital in 1959, and making his rounds as chief pediatrician, he met children wanting in life's very basics -- food, clothing, shelter, and parental love. He distilled his observations in 1963 in an eye-opening article, ''The Maltreated Syndrome in Children,'' in The New England Journal of Medicine. In 1972 he opened the hospital's first residential ''temporary shelter'' as a comprehensive treatment center for abusive mothers and their children. Dr. Fontana was chairman of the Mayor's Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect under John V. Lindsay, Abraham D. Beame, and Edward I. Koch. He held teaching and clinical positions at St. Vincent's Hospital, N.Y.U., and St. Albans Naval Hospital, among others. He is survived by a brother, Joseph, of Miami, and a sister, Lee Fontana Bobrow of Davie, Fla."

Randolph, a maverick allergist who founded the field of environmental medicine that holds that countless illnesses and allergies are the result of exposure to everyday and often commonplace chemical poisons, died on Friday in Delnor Community Hospital in Geneva, Ill. He was 89 and lived in Batavia, Ill. The cause was pneumonia, said officials at the Randolph Clinic, which Dr. Randolph founded in North Aurora, Ill. Dr. Randolph and several hundred doctors in the American Academy of Environmental Medicine contend that noxious chemical vapors from a wide variety of seemingly harmless materials like plastic, foam insulation and treated clothing release substances that can have devastating physical and mental effects on particularly susceptible people. Symptoms of what Dr. Randolph and his colleagues referred to as environmental illness included chronic headaches, fatigue and mental depression. Traditional medical bodies like the American College of Allergy and Immunology, which contended there was no scientific basis for his approach, are sharply skeptical of Dr. Randolph's unorthodox therapies. An allergist who received a traditional, blue-chip medical training, Dr. Randolph broke with organized medicine in 1950 and created several environmentally controlled units in the country, including the Aurora, Ill., clinic, where patients could seek protection from what they viewed as a potentially lethal environment. In some places, patients under Dr. Randolph's direction built homes in the wilderness to escape urban contamination. They would eat or expose themselves to nothing that was not considered environmentally benign. On occasion, such communities would attract patients who also suffered from delusions, critics pointed out. But as he marked his retirement from active medicine in 1992, Dr. Randolph seemed to relish tweaking his opponents. ""They regard me as a renegade,"" he said. ""Let them laugh, I'll take their patients."" After nearly half a century of offering his brand of medicine, Dr. Randolph found himself sitting atop a nationwide group of doctors and patients who embraced the concept of environmental illness.

27416,"A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., Federal Judge, Is Dead at 70","A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., who called himself ""a survivor of segregation"" and became one of the country's most prominent African-American judges, died yesterday in Boston.","A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., who called himself ""a survivor of segregation"" and became one of the country's most prominent African-American judges, died yesterday in Boston. He was 70 and died after a stroke for which he had been hospitalized on Saturday. Judge Higginbotham, a legal scholar, author and historian, was an influential Federal judge for 29 years until he retired in 1993. He often used the story of his own life, which began in an era of discrimination in Trenton, as an example of how what he called voiceless and forgotten people could overcome obstacles if they had help. From 1990 until his retirement, Judge Higginbotham was Chief Judge of the Federal appeals court in Philadelphia, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He was only the third black jurist to have directed any one of the country's circuit courts, the 12 Federal appeals panels that are second in importance only to the United States Supreme Court. Some historians say Judge Higginbotham was one of a handful of black jurists President Lyndon B. Johnson considered as candidates to integrate the Supreme Court before he named Thurgood Marshall the first black Justice in 1967. In a career of energetic accomplishment and unambiguous liberalism, Judge Higginbotham received much recognition as a legal scholar and civil rights advocate, including the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1995. But he persistently said that many of the advances for black Americans that he had applauded over a long legal career were endangered by cutbacks in affirmative action and reduced opportunities for black lawyers and judges. ""I witnessed the birth of racial justice in the Supreme Court and here now, after 45 years as a lawyer, judge and law professor, I sometimes feel as if I am watching justice die,"" he wrote in an article in The New York Times Magazine in January. After his retirement from the bench he taught at Harvard University, practiced law in New York and Washington and served on various corporate boards, including that of The New York Times Company. In 1996 he published ""Shades of Freedom"" (Oxford University Press), the second of four books he planned to write on the law and race. His earlier book, ""In the Matter of Color,"" published in 1978, dealt with the evolution of legal and racial attitudes in the era of slavery. At the time of his death, he was at work on an autobiography. Charles J. Ogletree Jr., a friend and fellow professor at Harvard, said yesterday that Judge Higginbotham would be remembered most as an influential legal thinker who championed affirmative action and civil rights. ""Once he succeeded,"" Professor Ogletree said, ""he was one who didn't hesitate to let the rope drop back down and help others who needed it."" Only days before his death, Judge Higginbotham's voice was still influencing the issues of the day. On Dec. 1, he testified before the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry. He joined other legal experts in expressing the view that there were no grounds for impeachment of President Clinton. In his testimony, he said that even if President Clinton had committed perjury, not all perjurious statements were equal under the law. He suggested that Mr. Clinton's misstatements about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky were more like lies to avoid a speeding ticket than like lies about selling the nation's security secrets to a foreign enemy. Judge Higginbotham often took strong positions. In recent years he was one of the most bitter public critics of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, saying that Justice Thomas's conservative opinions had injured black Americans. Last summer, after Justice Thomas addressed a group of black lawyers and judges, Judge Higginbotham said he did not deserve the honor of being keynote speaker because his rulings ""have done more to turn back the clock of racial progress than any other African-American public official in the history of this country."" Judge Higginbotham often cast his commitment to the law as a commitment to social justice. He said it had come from hard experience. In emotional speeches, the judge, who was a commanding 6 feet 5 inches tall, described how a white college president at Purdue University had flatly told him when he was a college freshman in 1944 that the school was not required under the law to provide black students with heated dormitories and, therefore, never would. He said that experience had persuaded him to become a lawyer, because he did not believe that the law should sanction such injustices. But even as an award-winning graduate from Yale Law School in 1952, he said in speeches, he could not escape the sting of bigotry. When he accepted an invitation for an interview at one of the premier Philadelphia law firms after law school, he said, a secretary seemed puzzled when he arrived. He soon realized that the firm's lawyers had assumed that the Yale student named Leon Higginbotham was white. The interviewing lawyer told him his resume was impressive. But then he added: ""Of course, you know there's nothing I can do for you,"" Judge Higginbotham said. By the time he reached the lobby of the law firm's building, he told a group of Yale Law School alumni years later, he was in tears. Ernest Rubenstein, a New York lawyer and Yale classmate who was in that crowd in 1989 when Judge Higginbotham described that experience, said yesterday that there were few dry eyes in the audience. But the speech, Mr. Rubenstein said, also included ample descriptions of teachers who had encouraged the young black scholar, and of the struggling parents who had insisted that he be given the chance to rise out of their troubled Ewing Park neighborhood in Trenton. ""I think he understood,"" Mr. Rubenstein said, ""no one ever does it alone."" Judge Higginbotham's most passionate opinions often dealt with social or racial issues. He was sometimes criticized by conservatives who said his liberal views were so evident that he could not project an impartial appearance. In one nationally noted opinion, he held in 1987 that local governments must pay for abortions for prison inmates if no other public or private financial aid was available. In an interview in 1989, he suggested that his accomplishments had come at some personal cost and described himself as a workaholic. Judge Higginbotham's wife, Dr. Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, is a professor of history and Afro-American studies at Harvard, where the retired judge had been a professor at Harvard College, Harvard Law School and the John F. Kennedy School of Government. He was also associated with the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. In addition to his wife, Judge Higginbotham is survived by two sons, Stephen and Kenneth of Philadelphia, and two daughters, Karen of Denver and Nia, a college student in Massachusetts. His first marriage, to Jeanne Higginbotham, ended in divorce in 1988. In the account of his life that Judge Higginbotham gave to audiences, he told of his journey from the segregated Trenton schools to his days as an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia and then as a partner in a black law firm. He was president of the Philadelphia chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from 1960 to 1962. He was named to the Federal District Court in Philadelphia in 1964, at age 36, by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter elevated him to the United States Court of Appeals. When Judge John J. Gibbons, the only judge who was his senior on the bench, stepped down in 1989, Judge Higginbotham automatically moved up to the chief judge's position. The other two black jurists who had held similar posts were William H. Hastie and Spottswood Robinson 3d. Justice Marshall of the Supreme Court suggested in an interview then that the time for measuring ""firsts"" for black judges should be drawing to a close. ""There is no more significance to it than anybody else becoming chief judge,"" Justice Marshall said. ""I think he is a great lawyer and a very great judge. Period."" That was an optimistic assessment of racial progress that Judge Higginbotham seemed not to share over the last few years as he expressed increasing alarm at what he described as an erosion of hard-won progress on racial issues in the law. But when he spoke to young people, the judge sometimes dwelled more on the opportunities for continued progress than on the problems he had seen in a long career. ""I will make two requests of you,"" he said to graduating seniors at Wesleyan University in 1996. ""They are that you always attempt to see those human beings who become invisible to most people, and that you always try to hear the pleas of those persons who, despite their pain and suffering, have become voiceless and forgotten."""

He was 85. Since his retirement in 1985, he had been living in Lincoln, Mass., with his wife, Aire-Maija, who survives him. Mr. Schwann's name has become as synonymous with record collecting as the name of Baedeker is to travel and Bartlett is to quotations. His reasons for starting the catalogue were eminently practical. He owned a store in Cambridge, across the street from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called simply ""The Record Shop."" At the time, long-playing records, which had been introduced by Columbia the previous year, were being released so quickly that Mr. Schwann had trouble keeping track of what was available. ""I had to protect myself from my bad memory,"" he said in an interview in later years. So he assembled a list of all available recordings, and typed it up, some 26 pages. ""This gave me the idea of doing the catalogue,"" he said. ""And since I had helped organize a Boston record dealers association during the war, when shellac was unavailable and records scarce, I had an immediate market for my guide."" At the time, there were 11 record labels with some 600 titles. The first Schwann catalogue, hand-typed and mimeographed, sold 11,000 copies. Within a month it was obsolete. So Mr. Schwann realized that he would have to publish a new issue every month. By 1953, the demands of the catalogue were so great that he had to give up his record shop. Rumford Press in Concord, N.H., was contracted to print the catalogue using an offset process. Mr. Schwann took on a staff, and eventually maintained information on a computer database. When he sold the catalogue in 1976 (although he kept running it until his retirement), it had expanded to over 300 pages with over 40,000 listings. Compiling the catalogue was often a nightmare of information gathering, and the information kept changing. During his time, Mr. Schwann saw the long-playing disk superseded by stereophonic records, audiotapes and compact disks. Initially the catalogues included sections for jazz and Broadway musicals, but Mr. Schwann never claimed as much completeness in those listings, which were eventually published separately. Trying to get clear answers from rapidly changing record companies about what releases were in the stores and available was exasperating. But by the 1960's, the Schwann catalogue was invaluable. Where else, for just $1, the cost at the time, could one find a complete listing of, say, the Beethoven piano sonatas, in order, with dates of composition, opus numbers and all available recordings? As a trained musicologist, Mr. Schwann was careful about facts but not obsessive. Where scholars had formed a consensus about, say, the chronology of the Mozart piano concertos, he drew on the latest thinking. But where confusion remained, for example, the order of the Haydn string quartets, he used the traditional and, he acknowledged, questionable opus numbers. William Joseph Schwann was born on May 13, 1913, in Salem, Ill., the son of the Rev. Henry W. and Effie A. Schwann. He attended the Conservatory of Music at the University of Louisville, earning a bachelor's degree in 1935. During these years he worked as an organist and choir director. He later moved to Boston, where he did graduate work at Harvard and Boston University, and studied organ with E. Power Biggs. The 30th-anniversary issue of the catalogue in 1979 was filled with congratulatory messages from luminaries like Aaron Copland and Isaac Stern. Mr. Schwann received many awards, including honorary doctorates from the University of Louisville and the New England Conservatory. In the late 1980's, the catalogue was sold to Stereophile. Today, the Schwann Opus catalogue, as it is called, is owned and published quarterly by Valley Media in New Mexico, and regularly runs over 1,000 pages."

A chemical engineer by training, Mr. Whitmore joined Kodak in 1957 and worked his way up through its photographic film business over the next 25 years. He was elected president in 1983 and succeeded Colby Chandler as chairman and chief executive in June 1990. He came under intense pressure in April 1993 when Christopher Steffen, hired months earlier from the outside to be chief financial officer, abruptly quit because of disagreements with him over how to improve Kodak's flagging financial performance. In 1991, Mr. Whitmore had approved early retirement packages that led to 8,300 layoffs and, the next year, cut his own salary by 19 percent, to $1.15 million. In January of 1993, Mr. Whitmore ordered the ''involuntary layoffs'' of 2,000 employees, saying it would cost less than what had been Kodak's traditional method of providing incentives for early retirement, and that it would ''send a signal to Wall Street.'' At the same time, Mr. Whitmore announced a plan to create a new committee of the directors to keep a closer watch on management operations at Kodak. He also cut research and development costs, saying that the reductions would not stunt Kodak's ability to generate new products. In an effort to tie Kodak's fortunes more closely to the people who led it, he initiated a plan to require all high-level executives to buy shares equal to one year's base pay. But Mr. Whitmore was ousted in August 1993 by Kodak's board, which said that he had not done enough to cut costs and enhance earnings. Two weeks later, Kodak moved to cut 10,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force. ''This is no small moment in my life,'' the taciturn Mr. Whitmore told employees in a parting message. ''But the company must improve its overall performance.'' Mr. Whitmore said he had planned to announce a restructuring plan in September 1993 to reverse Kodak's fortunes. Kodak's directors credited Mr. Whitmore with reducing debt, improving cash flow and streamlining a wide range of businesses. ''However, we believe there is a clear need to move faster and further on operating cost efficiencies and enhanced earnings,'' they said at the time. A native of Salt Lake City, Mr. Whitmore traveled to England the year after his dismissal to run a Mormon mission, a nonpaying post. Mr. Whitmore is survived by his wife, Yvonne, and their children Richard, Kimberly, Michele, Cynthia, Suzanne and Scott."

Zinberg, a psychoanalyst whose research into the effects of drugs on individuals and social groups influenced the direction of drug-abuse treatment, died Sunday of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Mass.","Dr. Norman E. Zinberg, a psychoanalyst whose research into the effects of drugs on individuals and social groups influenced the direction of drug-abuse treatment, died Sunday of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 67 years old. Dr. Zinberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and a psychiatrist at Cambridge Hospital, had long been recognized as a pioneer in studying the ways in which marijuana, heroin and other drugs affect human behavior. He served for many years as a consultant to government agencies dealing with drug problems and testified frequently on legislation seeking to curb illicit drugs. He played an important role in Congress's passage in October of a comprehensive bill aimed at reducing drug use through treatment and education. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said yesterday that the legislation faced rough going, enacted only on the final night of the Congressional session, and that ''to a singular degree we acted on the advice of Norman Zinberg.'' 'Remarkable Impact' Cited Authorities in the field say Dr. Zinberg broadened the concepts under which drug addiction is treated by psychiatrists and other health-care professionals. ''He had a remarkable impact on our understanding that drug effects are not simply a consequence of biochemistry,'' said Dr. Howard Shaffer, a colleague at Harvard and at Cambridge Hospital. ''He showed that an individual's expectations, his psychological set and his social milieu interact to produce the effects on behavior that we observe. Equally important, Norman Zinberg helped us explain why an addictive drug affects a person differently at different times and how it affects various people in different ways.'' Named to AIDS Committee Dr. Zinberg, a native of Harrisburg, Pa., received his bachor's and doctoral degrees from the University of Maryland. He served in the United States Army Medical Corps for four years during and after World War II and joined the Harvard Medical School faculty in 1952. He also taught at Boston University and the Tufts School of Medicine before his appointment to an assistant professorship at Harvard in 1964. From 1971 to 1982 Dr. Zinberg was chairman of the advisory committee of the Vera Institute of Justice in New York, and since 1976 he had been a member of the Drug Policy Foundation, based in Washington. During the Vietnam War he was a consultant to the Defense Department, studying drug-abuse problems among troops in Southeast Asia. Earlier this year Dr. Zinberg was one of the first appointees to the National AIDS Commission, which will recommend ways to implement Federal policy in treating the epidemic. Surviving are his wife, Dr. Dorothy Shore Zinberg; his mother, Esther, of Baltimore, and two daughters, Sarah, of San Mateo, Calif., and Annie, of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla."

Slade D. Cutter, one of the Navy's most highly decorated submarine captains of World War II and a star athlete at the United States Naval Academy in the 1930's, died on Thursday in Annapolis, Md. He was 93. His death was announced by the United States Naval Academy Alumni Association and Foundation. Under Captain Cutter's command, the submarine Seahorse sank 19 Japanese ships in 1943 and 1944. Captain Cutter was a four-time recipient of the Navy Cross, the service's highest award for valor after the Medal of Honor, and also received two Silver Stars and a Bronze Star. He graduated from the Naval Academy in 1935, then served aboard a battleship before entering submarine school. He was executive officer of the submarine Pompano on its Pacific patrols early in World War II, then became executive officer of the Seahorse and finally its commander in 1943. Slade Deville Cutter, who grew up on an Illinois farm, became a star tackle at the Naval Academy and was remembered for kicking a first-quarter field goal in a heavy rain to give Navy a 3-0 victory over Army at Philadelphia in 1934, its first triumph over the Cadets in 13 years. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967. At 6 feet 1 inch and 215 pounds, he was the undefeated collegiate heavyweight boxing champion while at the academy, and he also played lacrosse. ''Sports makes you offensive-minded,'' he told The Baltimore Sun in 1943. ''After all, this war is much like a game; it's you against the other fellow.'' After World War II, Captain Cutter had several seagoing assignments. He served as athletic director at the Naval Academy from 1957 to 1959 and commander of the Naval Training Center at Great Lakes, Ill., from 1963 to 1964. He retired from the Navy in 1965. He is survived by his second wife, Ruth; a son, Slade Jr., of Austin, Tex.; a daughter, Anne McCarthy of Santa Fe, N.M.; a sister, Louise Woodard of Portland, Ore.; nine grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His first wife, Frances, died in the 1980's."

He was 81 and had split his time between Hanover and Castine, Me., for many years. The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said his daughter Carol Booth. Mr. Booth wrote 10 books of poetry, including ''The Islanders,'' ''Weathers and Edges,'' ''Letter From a Distant Land'' and ''Lifelines: Selected Poems 1950-1999.'' He also wrote a book of essays about writing poetry called ''Trying to Say It: Outlooks and Insights on How Poems Happen.'' He received recognition and honors from many institutions, including Guggenheim, Rockefeller and National Endowment for the Arts fellowships. The sense of privacy that made poetry lovers appreciate Mr. Booth's work ultimately cost him fame. He spent hours upon hours writing and revising in his room, Ms. Booth said, drawing material from deeper and deeper within his emotional landscape. He rarely traveled on book tours or did readings for large groups. Stephen Dunn, a former student of Mr. Booth's and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for poetry, wrote in an e-mail message after Mr. Booth's death, ''Booth's quest was to deepen as opposed to range widely, and in that sense he was a poet of consciousness, even when his subject seemed to be the dailiness of Castine or the vagaries of sailing.'' Philip Edmund Booth was born in Hanover and spent most of his life there and in Castine, the city where his mother grew up and where he first learned to sail. He served in the Army Air Forces during World War II and married Margaret Tillman in 1946. In addition to his wife, of Hanover, and his daughter Carol, of Amherst, Mass., Mr. Booth is survived by two other daughters, Margot, of Austin, Tex., and Robin, of Rowe, Mass.; and a sister, Lee Klunder, of Hartland, Vt. He received his bachelor's degree in English at Dartmouth, where he studied under Robert Frost, and a master's degree in English at Columbia University. He later taught English at Bowdoin College and Wellesley College in the 1950s but spent the majority of his career at Syracuse University, where he was a professor, a poet in residence and a co-founder of the graduate program in creative writing. In a poem called ''First Lesson,'' Mr. Booth wrote to a daughter: As you float now, where I held you and let go, remember when fear cramps your heart what I told you: lie gently and wide to the light-year stars, lie back, and the sea will hold you."

Neuberger, who drew on youthful passions for stock trading and art to build one of Wall Street's most venerable partnerships and one of the country's largest private collections of 20th-century masterpieces, died on Friday at his home at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan.","Roy R. Neuberger, who drew on youthful passions for stock trading and art to build one of Wall Street's most venerable partnerships and one of the country's largest private collections of 20th-century masterpieces, died on Friday at his home at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan. He was 107 and had lived in New York City for 101 years. His death was confirmed by a grandson, Matthew London. Mr. Neuberger had set out to study art, but ended up as a stockbroker, a life path once likened to Gauguin's in reverse. As a founder of the investment firm Neuberger & Berman, he was one of the few people to experience three of Wall Street's major market crises, in 1929, 1987 and 2008. Although his artistic ability left no lasting impact, his wealth did. Believing that collectors should acquire art being produced in their own time and then hold on to it, giving the public access but never selling, Mr. Neuberger accumulated hundreds of paintings and sculptures by Milton Avery, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and others, becoming one of America's leading art patrons. Those works are now spread over more than 70 institutions in 24 states, many of them in the permanent collection of the Neuberger Museum of Art, which opened in 1974 on the Purchase College campus of the State University of New York. The money to buy the works came from his investments at Neuberger & Berman (now Neuberger Berman), the brokerage and investment firm he founded in 1939 with Robert B. Berman. The firm catered to wealthy individuals but also took on a less affluent clientele with the establishment, in 1950, of the Neuberger Guardian mutual fund, one of the first funds to be sold without the usual 8.5 percent upfront sales commission. His art collecting drew on the lessons he learned in the financial world. Each year he would buy more than he had bought the previous year, often purchasing large lots at a time. In 1948, for example, he bought 46 paintings by Milton Avery, whom Mr. Neuberger counted as a close friend. He eventually owned more than 100 Avery works. ''My experience on Wall Street made it possible for me to be comfortable buying a lot of art at once,'' he later wrote. ''In my investment firm, when we like a security after careful analysis, we buy a modest quantity. Sometimes after the purchase, we will find that we like it very much. If a large quantity of the stock then becomes available, and we are still enthusiastic about its value and its future, we will buy in quantity quickly, even though the day before we had no such plan and no knowledge that the stock would be available.'' ''The same principle,'' he added, ''applied to my purchase of the Avery paintings.''Roy Rothschild Neuberger was born on July 21, 1903, in Bridgeport, Conn. His father, Louis, who was 52 when Roy was born, had come to the United States from Germany as a boy. His mother, the former Bertha Rothschild, was a native of Chicago, a lover of music (she played the piano) and a ''nervous, troubled woman from a large, well-to-do Jewish family, not related to the famous Rothschilds,'' Mr. Neuberger wrote in an autobiography, ''So Far, So Good: The First 94 Years'' (John Wiley & Sons, 1997). His father was half owner of the Connecticut Web and Buckle Company and had an interest in the stock market, owning thousands of shares in a Montana copper company. The Neuberger family moved to Manhattan in 1909, settling on Claremont Avenue opposite Barnard College on the Upper West Side. Mr. Neuberger attended DeWitt Clinton High School, where in his senior year he was captain of the tennis team that won the Greater New York championship. ''Looking back on my youthful addiction to tennis, I find it not much different from my fascination with the market,'' Mr. Neuberger wrote in his autobiography. ''You have to make fast decisions. You can't wait to think about it overnight.'' A similar impatience led him to leave New York University after a single year. He felt, he wrote, ''that I could learn much more out in the world of business.'' It was while working for two years as a buyer of upholstery fabrics for the department store B. Altman & Company that he said he developed an eye for painting and sculpture as well as a sense for trading. Both would greatly influence his later life, as would John Galsworthy's series of novels ''The Forsyte Saga,'' which described the practice among well-to-do English families of educating their children on the European continent, and ''Vincent van Gogh,'' a biography by Floret Fels. The first book led Mr. Neuberger to a sojourn in Europe. Using money inherited from his father, he set out in June 1924 for a life of leisure. While living mainly on the Left Bank in Paris, he spent afternoons at a cafe, played in tennis tournaments in Cannes and traveled to Berlin and other European capitals. In Paris, Mr. Neuberger was inspired by the van Gogh biography to collect and support the work of living artists. ''Of course, to do so, I had to have capital of considerably more than the inheritance that gave me an annual income of about $2,000,'' he later wrote. ''In those days you could live very comfortably, almost luxuriously, on $2,000, but you couldn't buy art in quantity. So I decided to go back to work in earnest.'' He arrived on Wall Street in the spring of 1929, as the bull market was roaring toward its peak. Hired for $15 a week as a runner for the brokerage firm Halle & Stieglitz, he soon learned all aspects of the business, at the same time managing his own money. One of the first big trades he executed on his own behalf was designed to hedge his own wealth against the possibility that the stock market might fall from its precarious height. He sold short 100 shares of the Radio Corporation of America, the most popular stock of the era, betting that its price would decline from its lofty level of $500. In October 1929 came the crash that ushered in the Great Depression, and while Mr. Neuberger's blue-chip stocks fell, his bet against RCA paid off well: the stock's price eventually fell into the single digits. He said he lost only 15 percent of his money in the crash, while many others lost everything. On June 29, 1932, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped to 42 and Mr. Neuberger married Marie Salant, a graduate in economics from Bryn Mawr who had gone to work in the research department of Halle & Stieglitz two years earlier. ''I can report that by June 29, 1996, the Dow Jones industrial average had climbed to 5,704 and Marie and I had had 64 wonderful years together,'' Mr. Neuberger later wrote. Mrs. Neuberger died in 1997. Besides Mr. London, Mr. Neuberger is survived by his daughter, Ann Neuberger Aceves; his sons, Roy S. Neuberger of Lawrence, N.Y., and James A. Neuberger of New York City; seven other grandchildren; and 30 great-grandchildren. Emboldened by his management of his own assets, Mr. Neuberger became a stockbroker at Halle & Stieglitz in 1930, leaving nine years later to start his own firm, Neuberger & Berman. The firm was later acquired by Lehman Brothers, but spun off in 2008 as a stand-alone company with Lehman's bankruptcy. Mr. Neuberger continued to go to his Neuberger Berman office every day until he was 99, Mr. London said. Mr. Neuberger began to build his art collection in the late 1930s, and although he was asked to do so many times, he never sold a painting by a living artist. ''I have not collected art as an investor would,'' he said. ''I collect art because I love it.'' He preferred to share his love by donating works to museums and colleges. In May 1965, Mr. Neuberger received an anonymous offer to buy his art collection for $5 million, a sum he considered a fortune at the time. Years later he learned that the offer had come from Nelson A. Rockefeller, then governor of New York. Mr. Rockefeller went on to play a key role in Mr. Neuberger's art collection. In May 1967, while Mr. Neuberger was visiting Mr. Rockefeller at his Pocantico Hills estate in Westchester County, the governor offered to have New York State build a museum to house the collection at the State University campus at Purchase. Designed by Philip Johnson, the museum opened in May 1974. Mr. Neuberger often said that the true spirit of his collection could be found on the second floor, which held seminal paintings by Pollock, Stuart Davis, Edward Hopper and Georgia O'Keeffe, as well as many Milton Averys. Mr. Neuberger made an additional gift of $1.3 million to the State University at Purchase in 1984 and other major gifts to the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also served as a president of the New York Society for Ethical Culture and the American Federation of Arts. Mr. Neuberger's second memoir, ''The Passionate Collector,'' was published by John Wiley & Sons in 2003. At a White House ceremony in 2007, President Bush presented Mr. Neuberger with a National Medal of Arts. Like any collector, Mr. Neuberger rued the ones that got away. He remembered passing up a Grant Wood painting as well as refusing to pay $300 for a Jasper Johns in the late 1950s. One time a dealer offered him a Picasso sculpture for $1,500, but he declined because he was buying works only by American artists. ''I was such a square that I stupidly didn't buy it,'' he told The New York Times in an interview in 2003. Mr. Neuberger bought all his works himself, usually through dealers. And his taste ran toward the bold. ''I liked adventuresome work that I often didn't understand,'' he told The Times as he was celebrating his 100th birthday. ''For art to be very good it has to be over your head.'' But he said he enjoyed the challenge that the work posed to the viewer. ''Those who understand the mysteries of art,'' he said, ''are made happier by doing so.''"

38176,"Allen Rosenberg, Olympic Rowing Coach Who Transformed the Sport, Dies at 82","Allen Rosenberg, a coxswain-turned-coach whose innovations in rowing technique helped produce Olympic and world champions, died on Dec. 7 at his home in Silver Spring, Md.","Allen Rosenberg, a coxswain-turned-coach whose innovations in rowing technique helped produce Olympic and world champions, died on Dec. 7 at his home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 82. Rosenberg had Lewy body dementia, a progressive brain disorder, though the exact cause of death was uncertain, his daughter Miriam Rosenberg said. At 5 feet 1 inch and never a great deal more than 100 pounds, Rosenberg was a half-pint in a world dominated by gallon jugs. But that did not stop him from mentoring athletes who were twice his size and, during a couple of decades, spurring them to victory in myriad international competitions with his intellect and shrewd motivational skill. ''I can't possibly explain the difference between the silver and the gold,'' he once said to his rowers, ''but if you win the silver, you'll wake up the next morning and know that someone rowed a better race than you, and I don't want you to go through life thinking of that.'' Twice, in 1961 and 1965, his rowers won three gold medals at the Maccabiah Games in Israel, and in 1975, his American team won two golds at the Pan-American Games. Most notably, he was the United States Olympic coach in 1964 in Tokyo, where the American eight -- an eight-man boat plus a coxswain -- reclaimed the gold medal in an event the United States had lost in 1960 after decades of domination. He also coached the American eight to victory in the 1974 world championships in Lucerne, Switzerland. ''Folks are always looking down at Rosenberg, as well as up to him,'' Sports Illustrated wrote in 1975. Indeed, along with the jockeylike physique of a coxswain -- who steers a racing shell and directs the rowers -- he had a coxswain's gift for alertness and command, people who knew him said. By profession, he was a lawyer and a pharmacist, and he used his academiclike acuity to help transform rowing from pure brute enterprise into a modern amalgam of science and sport. ''More than any coach I've ever known, he studied how to make a boat move,'' Ken Brown, who, at 6-3 and 194 pounds, was one of the smaller rowers on the 1974 championship boat, said in an interview Wednesday. ''He took what was often a frenetic and power-washing way -- putting the oar in the water and whaling away at it -- to something more relaxed. His constant comments were about lightness of hands and relaxing and balancing in the recovery part of the stroke. Concentrate on a long pull in the water, quiet and even. The less water you disturb, the faster the boat goes.'' Rosenberg coxed at Vesper Boat Club in Philadelphia, one of the nation's leading rowing clubs, in the 1950s, and he took the head-coaching job there, for no pay, in 1962. As the 1964 Olympic coach, he faced significant pressure: The eight-man competitions are the glamour events in rowing, and after triumphing in eight straight Olympics dating to 1920, the American eight had failed to earn a medal at the 1960 Games in Rome. At Vesper, Rosenberg had begun importing European, particularly German, ideas to rowing and adopting European boats, oars and training methods in developing a style that emphasized efficiency along with strength. At the time, the traditional rowing motion -- in the United States, at least -- employed a collective burst of power from the major parts of the body. But Rosenberg taught his rowers to fire their muscle groups in rotation rather than all at once. The technique became known as the Rosenberg style; he explained its logic by using the metaphor of men moving a boulder. ''Some coaches say that if you want to move it, you put everything you've got into a single great heave,'' he said in a 1976 interview with The New York Times Magazine. ''I contend that it is better to use muscle groups in sequence -- legs, shoulders, backs, arms -- because the problem is not merely to budge the boulder but to keep it rolling as smoothly as possible. No worthwhile races are won by crews who work the entire distance.'' After winning Olympic gold in 1964, an American eight would not match that feat for 40 years. Rosenberg's 1964 team also won a gold in the men's coxed pairs event and a silver and bronze in other rowing categories. ''He was a crafty little devil, very much the coxswain, even as the coach,'' said Boyce Budd, who, at 6-3 and 207 pounds, rowed for Rosenberg's gold-medal-winning eight. Budd added: ''The impact of this man on U.S. rowing was enormous. 'Innovator' is the word I would use. It had been an old boys' club, very Ivy League oriented, and those people were all very clubby, tended to row like one another, these great big American blond oarsmen rowing in a simplistic and kind of mindless way. Al brought an intellectual approach to the sport, and it worked.'' Allen Perry Rosenberg was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 29, 1931. His father, Harry, was a cab and truck driver; his mother, the former Rose Schwartz, was a department-store clerk. He attended Penn State -- where, at 98 pounds, he wrestled in the 118-pound weight class, his family said -- but dropped out to help support the family after his father died. Resuming his studies later at Temple University, he earned a pharmacy degree and then began coxing at the Vesper club in 1954 while working as a pharmacist and attending Temple's law school at night. In 1955, he was cox on a gold-medal-winning eight at the Pan-Am Games; in 1958, he was on the silver-medal boat at the world championships. He took the coaching job at Vesper in 1962. Rosenberg's first marriage, to the former Ruth Borsuk, ended in divorce. Besides his daughter Miriam, he is survived by five other children from his first marriage, Sarah, Rebecca, Daniel, Tziporah and Isaac; his wife of 23 years, Lisbeth Sklar; two brothers, his twin, Arnold, and Stanley; a stepson, Joshua Cohen; four grandchildren; and two stepgrandchildren. Rosenberg coached the United States Olympic team again at the 1976 Games in Montreal, where it won a silver in the men's coxless pair. But the men's eight failed to earn a medal after Rosenberg had dismissed several potential team members, including Ken Brown, who had grown impatient waiting for him to name his eight Olympic rowers. ''For all his great traits, Al could get set on an idea and be immovable,'' Brown said. ''He was taking a long time to make a decision about the eight.'' He perceived their impatience as a mutiny, Brown said. Rosenberg continued to coach at the club level and to mentor other coaches, a role in which his contrasting qualities -- a killer competitiveness and a generous, tender sensibility -- were in evidence. ''Allen reminded me of a bird,'' said Peter Mallory, a leading rowing historian. ''A bird of prey, but a delicate, fragile person.''"

18250,"Stanley Meltzoff, 89, Avid Diver Who Painted Marine Life","Stanley Meltzoff, who dived to great depths to photograph sea life and then, in his studio, transformed those images into vibrant paintings for magazines like Sports Illustrated and Scientific American, died Thursday in Red Bank, N.J.","Stanley Meltzoff, who dived to great depths to photograph sea life and then, in his studio, transformed those images into vibrant paintings for magazines like Sports Illustrated and Scientific American, died Thursday in Red Bank, N.J. He was 89 and lived in Fair Haven, N.J. The death was confirmed by his wife, Diane Pogrant. Wandering the world for more than 40 years -- from the shores of Montauk and Key West to the atolls of the Pacific and the Mediterranean coast -- Mr. Meltzoff spent his days peering at bonefish as they mated six inches below the surface or using scuba gear to photograph sharks, eels or goliath groupers at depths of 100 feet or more. An artist and art professor earlier in his life, he began to concentrate on fish images in the early 1960s. In ''Bound for Blue Water: Contemporary American Marine Art'' (Greenwich Workshop Press, 2003), the marine art historian J. Russell Jinishian called Mr. Meltzoff ''the father and founder of the genre.'' ''To say that water is in Stanley Meltzoff's blood is an understatement,'' the book said. It also displayed Mr. Meltzoff's detailed depictions of butterfish, bluefin tuna, black marlin, bonefish and barracuda -- to name a few -- in shades of red, green, orange, purple, silver and, of course, blue. Mr. Meltzoff roamed ''in search of many species of fish that he studied, photographed and interacted with in their natural environments,'' Mr. Jinishian said. ''He then put his masterful brushwork on canvas to create images that, for the most part, are the only way these beautiful animals can be seen.'' Born in Harlem on March 27, 1917, Mr. Meltzoff was a son of Nathan and Sadie Marcus Meltzoff. His father was a cantor at a Manhattan synagogue. Mr. Meltzoff graduated from City College in 1937 and earned a master's degree in fine art from New York University in 1940. During World War II, he was an artist for Stars and Stripes, the military newspaper, in Europe. He taught painting and art history at City College from 1939 to 1941, and taught there again after the war until 1950, when he began a five-year stint at Pratt Institute. But even as a child in the 1920s, Mr. Meltzoff had been an avid skin diver, mainly off the New Jersey coast. By the 1940s, he was keen on spear fishing and scuba diving and, starting in 1949, he added underwater photography. He first combined his passions for the sea, photography and art in the 1960s, when he painted several series on particular fish species for Sports Illustrated, National Geographic and Field & Stream. Mr. Meltzoff's first wife, Alice Forder Meltzoff, died in 1979. Besides his second wife, whom he married in 1999, he is survived by two daughters, Sarah Keene Meltzoff of Miami and Annie Laurie Armistead of Davis, Calif.; three stepchildren, Jessie Dulberger of Boulder, Colo., Stephanie Ritz of Oshkosh, Wis., and Matt Ritz of Tacoma, Wash.; and a brother, Julian, of San Diego. Mr. Meltzoff's art was not been limited to marine life. He did illustrations, including landscapes and historical subjects, for Life, The Saturday Evening Post and Colliers. In 1976, he was commissioned by AT&T to paint a whimsical telephone book cover celebrating the nation's bicentennial and the company's centennial. The cover, on 187 million phone books distributed nationwide, included an American Indian bewildered by smoke signals rising from a telephone receiver. But Mr. Meltzoff always returned to the sea, ''a place without horizons,'' he once wrote, where he could dive ''through the surface into the looking-glass world where I flew down into the deeper blue, until I fell back up into the air, exhausted with delight.''"

46590,"John Higham, 82, Historian of Nation's Role as a Melting Pot","John Higham, a cultural historian who examined the interplay of ethnic and national identity in the United States, died July 26 at his home in Baltimore.","John Higham, a cultural historian who examined the interplay of ethnic and national identity in the United States, died July 26 at his home in Baltimore. He was 82. The cause was a cerebral aneurysm, said Dorothy Ross, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University, where Dr. Higham was emeritus John Martin Vincent Professor. Dr. Higham called himself ""an old-fashioned historian"" in his university biography. He was known as an exponent of the notion of America as a melting pot when many of his contemporaries preferred to focus on the social history of particular racial and ethnic groups. His first book, ""Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism"" (Rutgers University Press, 1955) addressed the hostility native-born Americans showed toward immigrants outside the Anglo-Saxon fold. Mr. Higham's last book, ""Hanging Together: Unity and Diversity in American Culture"" (Yale, 2001) also focused on the broad mainstream of American culture, rather than the groups it may have been oppressing. George M. Fredrickson, writing in The New York Review of Books in 2002, applauded Dr. Higham's unwillingness to dismiss the culture created by ""elite white males."" Mr. Fredrickson wrote, ""Much of value has come from social and cultural history 'from the bottom up,' but it has deprived us of a unifying vision of the nation's past across the divides of gender, race, ethnicity and class."" John William Higham was born in Jamaica, Queens, on Oct. 26, 1920. He graduated from Johns Hopkins in 1941 and received a master's degree from Yale in 1942. In World War II, he was in the historical division of the Army Air Corps in Italy. He was an assistant editor of The American Mercury, the magazine founded by H. L. Mencken, for a year, then earned a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin in 1949. He taught at the University of California at Los Angeles, Rutgers, Columbia and the University of Michigan before returning to Johns Hopkins as John Martin Vincent Professor of History in 1971. In writing the American history section of ""History: Professional Scholarship in America"" (Johns Hopkins, 1965, 1983, 1989) Dr. Higham explored tensions between academic and popular history. He urged historians to relax their impersonal stance for one of moral engagement. He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Eileen; his daughters Margaret Higham of Winchester, Mass., and Constance Vidor of Manhattan; his sons Jay, of Sandy Hook, Conn., and Daniel, of Baltimore; and seven grandchildren. In his dissections of American culture, Dr. Higham often pondered national symbols. In 1983, he told U.S. News & World Report that the two great symbols of the 19th century were the covered wagon and the Statue of Liberty because ""they both mean opportunity grasped by moving on."""
