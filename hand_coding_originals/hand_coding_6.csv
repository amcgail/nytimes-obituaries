9193,LYNN FONTANNE IS DEAD AT 95; A STAR WITH LUNT FOR 37 YEARS,"Lynn Fontanne, who with Alfred Lunt created one of the greatest husband-and-wife acting teams of the theater, died of pneumonia today.","GENESEE DEPOT, Wis., July 30 Lynn Fontanne, who with Alfred Lunt created one of the greatest husband-and-wife acting teams of the theater, died of pneumonia today. She was 95 years old. Miss Fontanne was found dead by a maid at Ten Chimneys, the retreat she had shared with Mr. Lunt. Excellence in High Comedy In 1929 Ring Lardner published a ballad that contained this couplet: You want to pack 'em in out front? Hire Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt. Lardner's prescription for Broadway success was unfailingly effective for 37 years, from 1923 to 1960. The couple held audiences spellbound with their theatrical magic, packing houses wherever they appeared, in New York, London, on the road in the United States. Alfred Lunt died Aug. 3, 1977, at the age of 84. They worked together in 27 productions. They made the fledgling Theater Guild of the 1920's a great commercial success by appearing in its early subscription plays. Miss Fontanne, slim, willowy, with a throaty contralto, excelled with Lunt at high comedy, the kind of saucy wit characteristic of Noel Coward or S.N. Behrman. It was the result of constant practice. ''Miss Fontanne and I rehearse all the time,'' Mr. Lunt once remarked. ''Even after we leave the theater, we rehearse. We sleep in the same bed. We have a script on our hands when we go to bed. You can't come and tell us to stop rehearsing after eight hours.'' The Lunts were able to speak through each other's lines on the stage, yet were always heard separately. Their dialogues, therefore, were like Gilbert and Sullivan patter songs, but in their version there was no nonsense. In their dovetailing of dialogue, they seemed to be carrying on a realistic conversation, letting their friends in the audience in on a slice of it. The Lunts indulged in a bit of love-making business in their plays. They were never bawdy, just broad. In Terence Rattigan's ''O Mistress Mine,'' there was a scene in which the couple partook of love play on a couch. At one matinee, according to a Broadway story, a woman, unsettled by the realism, got up to leave. A friend restrained her. ''It's perfectly all right,'' she whispered. ''They are married in private life, you know.'' 'A Constant Joy to Watch' Their superb rapport prompted the critic John Mason Brown to remark: ''They play together as no other actors in our theater do, with a fluency that is matchless, and an unselfish and precise sense of give and take that is a constant joy to watch.'' Mr. Lunt was a product of the American Middle West and Lynn Fontanne was the British-born daughter of an impecunious French typefounder and his Irish wife. Miss Fontanne was arch about the date of her birth and her real first name, but most students of her life agreed that she was born Lillie Louise Fontanne on Dec. 6, 1887. She denied that the proper year was 1882, apparently the birth date of an older sister. The young Miss Fontanne wanted to become an actress, and she was introduced to Ellen Terry, the British actress, in 1905. Miss Terry coached her and arranged for her debut as a chorus girl in ''Cinderella'' in December 1905. From then on Miss Fontanne got small parts, made some money as an artist's model, fell in love with a lawyer but did not marry him, but in 1914 she won a fat part in Arnold Bennett's ''Milestones.'' Her success, all the more remarkable because she was slender in an age of plumpness and relatively tall, at 5 feet 6 inches, at a time when petiteness was esteemed, made her a figure in London's theatrical world and gained her the friendship of young Noel Coward and Laurette Taylor. Miss Taylor brought Miss Fontanne to the United States, where she made her New York debut in November 1916, in ''The Harp of Life.'' There followed such roles as Bianca in ''The Taming of the Shrew'' and Mrs. Glendinning in ''Someone in the House,'' a play of which George S. Kaufman was an author. Miss Fontanne had, according to John Corbin, The New York Times's drama critic in those years, ''extraordinary powers of personality.'' Courtship Had 3-Year Run Miss Fontanne and Mr. Lunt were introduced backstage at the New Amsterdam Theater in 1919. He was said to have been standing on an iron staircase and to have stumbled and fallen on his face as he stepped forward to shake hands. After a three-year courtship, they were married May 22, 1922. Miss Fontanne had just completed a successful run as Dulcinea in ''Dulcy'' by Kaufman and Marc Connelly, and Mr. Lunt had wound up an appearance opposite Billie Burke in Booth Tarkington's ''The Intimate Strangers.'' Mr. Lunt was five years younger than his wife. The next year they appeared together for the first time in Paul Kester's ''Sweet Nell of Old Drury.'' Mr. Lunt was Charles II and Miss Fontanne was Lady Castlemaine. Their collaboration was highly regarded, but not nearly so highly as their joint efforts a year later in ''The Guardsman.'' This play, on Broadway for almost 40 weeks, gave the Theater Guild its first solid commercial success and gave the Lunts a showcase. Writing of the opening night in The New York Sun, Alexander Woollcott said: ''They have youth and great gifts and the unmistakable attitude of ascent, and those who saw them last night bowing hand in hand for the first time may well have been witnessing a moment in theatrical history.'' The Biggest Hit The Lunts' biggest hit was ''O Mistress Mine,'' which opened in New York in January 1946, and ran for 451 performances. Then came three years on the road, in which the Lunts played about 400 cities and towns, coast to coast. The Lunts thrived emotionally on touring (''Every night is like opening night,'' Miss Fontanne said of onenight stands), and financially. They got a percentage of the gross. They played together in only two dramas that might be classified as serious, Robert E. Sherwood's ''There Shall Be No Night'' and Friedrich Durrenmatt's ''The Visit.'' Their other plays were written by light playwrights -Coward, Behrman, Sherwood, Terence Rattigan, Ferenc Molnar, Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, Maxwell Anderson, and Jean Giraudoux, author of ''Amphitryon 39.'' Praise for 1929 Performance Their ability to make thin plots work was evident early. In 1929 they appeared in ''Caprice,'' a Viennese concoction about love, and were observed by St. John Ervine, who was then a guest reviewer for The New York World. ''It has not been my luck to see Mr. Alfred Lunt or Miss Lynn Fontanne act before,'' he wrote. ''I shall esteem myself a very unfortunate fellow if I never see them again.'' A quarter of a century later, when the Lunts were playing in ''The Great Sebastians'' by Lindsay and Crouse, Brooks Atkinson, the drama critic for The New York Times, called them ''stylists of the first rank.'' In an industry notable for personal feuding, the Lunts counted few enemies. They even managed to get along well with the acerbic Woollcott. Coward was also a friend, and they starred in three of his plays. Miss Fontanne was Gilda in ''Design for Living,'' Linda Valaine in ''Point Valaine'' and Serena in ''Quadrille.'' Coward's experience with Miss Fontanne and her husband was typical of that of other playwrights and directors who came in contact with the couple's formidable collective ego. ''Direct the Lunts? My dear boy, when you do a play with the Lunts, nobody directs them,'' Coward told Maurice Zolotow, the Broadway chronicler. ''Oh, they have a delusion that they listen to a director, but they don't, y'know. 'Quadrille,' it was said, was directed by Noel Coward. Noel Coward refused this honor, I insisted the posters must read, 'Directed by the author with the grateful assistance of the Lunts.' It was the truth.'' Although Miss Fontanne was at least 37 when she played The Actress in Molnar's ''The Guardsman'' in 1924, she looked far younger. When she was 73, in ''The Visit,'' she created the illusion that she was no more than 50. Skillful use of makeup was, of course, part of the explanation for her agelessness. There were also a daily hourlong bath in hot water, a brisk half-hour walk and stretching and bending exercises. An Exercise to Battle Wrinkles To counter wrinkles around the jaw line, she said, ''I raise my neck and twist it from side to side, and the around and around. About 20 minutes, I do this in the morning. I've never had my face lifted. Never had any plastic surgery.'' At parties the Lunts gave or attended, Marc Connelly was often the star guest, and his living room act, ''Death of Cleopatra,'' always drew loud applause. The cherubic-looking playwright played the death scene to the hilt, and at the end, calling for the asp, he mimed its fatal bite and then cried out, in feigned surprise, his one-word clincher - ''Jee-ZUS!'' The Lunts enjoyed the bucolic serenity of Ten Chimneys, their 120-acre farm at Genessee Depot. Always side by side, the Lunts interviewed thousands of novice actors, coached many of them free of charge and supported some financially. It was always Miss Fontanne who, on opening nights, comforted her husband and dispelled his doubts as to the success of a play, to assure him that he was a fine actor and director. Superlatives From Critics In the mid-1920's, under Theater Guild auspices, the Lunts appeared together in Shaw's ''Arms and the Man,'' ''Pygmalion'' and ''The Doctor's Dilemma.'' With a couple of exceptions in 1927-28, they never appeared apart. With a couple of exceptions, critics extolled them with superlatives. One exception was Eugene O'Neill's ''Strange Interlude,'' in which Miss Fontanne played Nina Leeds. It was among her few excursions into completely serious drama, and it was not an unqualified success. Light-hearted material was more her style - ''Idiot's Delight,'' ''Amphitryon 38,'' ''The Pirate.'' ''There Shall Be No Night,'' Mr. Sherwood's play built around the Soviet-Finnish war of 1940, was too serious to display fully Miss Fontanne's comic talents. In 1935 she received the gold medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and when she and her husband appeared in ''The Pirate'' in 1943, both were rewarded with the Delia Austrian Medal by the Drama League of New York for the best performance of the season. Miss Fontanne received the degree of Doctor of Letters from Russell Sage College in 1950. New York University, Dartmouth and Yale each conferred on the Lunts degrees of Doctor of Humane Letters. In 1964, also, the Lunts were honored by The Players, the New York theatrical organization founded by Edwin Booth. Sir Ralph Richardson said, on the scene: ''In this country we often hear about the superiority of English stars. We have some very good performers, but America has something greater - America has the Lunts.'' A Medal at the White House The same year, they received the United States Freedom Medal in ceremonies at the White House. After their appearance in New York in ''I Know My Love'' in 1950, the Lunts did not appear on the local stage for four years. They toured in the play and revisited London for a 14-month engagement in ''Quadrille,'' which Coward wrote for them. In 1954 they returned to New York in ''Quadrille'' and the critics again confirmed their standing as the royal players of the theater. After touring in 1956 and 1957 in ''The Great Sebastians,'' the Lunts appeared in ''The Visit''in London. They brought that play to New York in 1958 to open the Lunt-Fontanne Theater at 205 West 46th Street, and went on tour the following year. Miss Fontanne appeared in three movies, ''Second Youth,'' ''The Guardsman'' and ''Stage Door Canteen.'' She was seen on television toward the close of her career. One of her last TV roles was the Dowager Empress in ''Anastasia,'' an adaptation of a French play by Marcel Maurette. Previously, in 1965, she and her husband had received Emmy Awards for their portrayals of Justice and Mrs. Oliver Wendell Holmes in Emmet Lavery's ''The Magnificent Yankee.''"

10861,"Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez, Former Spanish Official, 62, Dies","Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez, who helped remold Spain's image in the post-Franco era and served as Foreign Minister from 1985 until June, died today at his home in Madrid.","MADRID, Aug. 7 Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez, who helped remold Spain's image in the post-Franco era and served as Foreign Minister from 1985 until June, died today at his home in Madrid. He was 62 years old. He died of cancer of the colon and liver, according to his doctor, Carlos Sanz. His body lay in state this afternoon at the Foreign Ministry in Madrid. Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez, who used the nickname Paco, helped reorient Spain's business and political goals during the transition to democracy after the death of the dictator Franco in 1975. He oversaw Spain's integration into the European Community and NATO in the mid-1980's. Born on June 22, 1930, in Madrid, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez studied at Harvard in the United States and earned a law degree at the University of Madrid. He began his career as a tax inspector and moved to the Finance Ministry in 1969. He held civil service posts in the Franco dictatorship, heading the Government-run National Institute of Industry, but soon joined the growing democratic opposition to Franco's rule and took part in talks aimed at restoring democracy after Franco'sdeath. As Finance Minister from 1977 to 1979 in the centrist Government of Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez was responsible for passage of controversial income-tax reforms, introducing graduated taxation. The number of taxpayers rose from 1.5 million people in 1977 to more than 12 million over the years. In 1979 he was appointed Justice Minister in the centrist Government of Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, where he drew bitter criticism from conservative politicians for the legalization of divorce in 1981. The divorce law was the harbinger of separation of church and state in Spain. He was named chairman of Spain's state-controlled export-financing bank, Banco Exterior, in 1983 and was appointed Foreign Minister in 1985, two years after Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the Socialists came to power. Considered more pro-American than his predecessor, Fernando Moran, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez campaigned for NATO membership, a step that Spanish voters approved in a referendum. He guided the country to membership in the European Community in 1986 and continued to campaign for greater European integration, championing the Maastricht treaty on political and economic union, which is now awaiting ratification by the 12 community nations. Attending his first meeting of European Community foreign ministers in the mid-1980's, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez was reported to have said, ""Just call me Paco,"" a phrase that became his trademark introduction on policy missions throughout the world. Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez was widely credited in his country for having placed Spain on the map of modern international politics. He helped pave the way for restoration of diplomatic ties with Israel in 1986 and gave the Palestine Liberation Organization mission in Madrid what is described by some envoys as de facto diplomatic status. He was perhaps most proud of Spain's role as host in the first round of Middle East peace talks in Madrid last October. He said he had circled the world 150 times as a diplomat, although his illness, which he never publicly acknowledged, began to take its toll this year. After a final trip in May to Chile and Argentina, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez canceled all appointments, citing exhaustion. Mr. Gonzalez accepted his resignation on June 22, Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez's 62d birthday. King Juan Carlos described Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez today as ""an exemplary minister"" and one of Spain's ""finest statesmen."" Mr. Fernandez-Ordonez is survived by his wife, Mari Paz Garcia Mayo."
58312,Stanford Lipsey Dies at 89; His Weeklies Won Pulitzer,"Stanford Lipsey, a publisher who persuaded Warren E. Buffett to invest in newspapers and whose chain of Nebraska weeklies won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing fund-raising excesses by Boys Town, the charity for orphaned children, died on Tuesday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif.","Stanford Lipsey, a publisher who persuaded Warren E. Buffett to invest in newspapers and whose chain of Nebraska weeklies won a Pulitzer Prize for exposing fund-raising excesses by Boys Town, the charity for orphaned children, died on Tuesday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 89. His death was confirmed by his wife, Judith. Under Mr. Lipsey, the Sun Newspapers, in the Omaha area, won the Pulitzer Prize for Local Investigative Specialized Reporting (a category since discontinued) in 1973 for disclosing that Boys Town was still soliciting contributions even though it had accrued hundreds of millions of dollars in assets and its caseload of abandoned and handicapped youngsters had shrunk. The Sun estimated that the net worth of Boys Town, which was founded in 1921 by the Rev. Edward J. Flanagan, was growing by as much as $18 million a year -- four times as much as it needed to maintain its programs. ''Boys Town, America's richest city: 700 boys with $209 million,'' the headline proclaimed in the Sun papers, owned by Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. The Pulitzer, rare for a weekly news organization, prompted fund-raising reforms: Boys Town hired consultants and abandoned its alarmist appeals for contributions. Mr. Lipsey left Omaha in 1980 to join The Buffalo News, a major daily newspaper in that area. Mr. Buffett, from his Omaha headquarters, had recently bought it. Three years later, Mr. Lipsey was appointed publisher and remained in that job for nearly three decades, retiring in 2012. In Buffalo he was a crusader for the city's economic revival, a preservationist and, as an early and well-rewarded investor in Berkshire Hathaway, a philanthropist. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York once called him western New York's ''guardian angel.'' Stanford Lipsey was born in Omaha (as was Mr. Buffett) on Oct. 8, 1927, to Jewish immigrants from Russia. His father, Jacob, owned a wholesale poultry and meat market. His mother was the former Molly Brick. Stanford got a camera when he was 10 and became photography editor of his high school newspaper and college yearbook. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in economics, he served in the Air Force as the editor of a base newspaper. His first marriage, to the former Jeanne Blacker, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, the former Judith Hojnacki, he is survived by two children, Janet and Daniel Lipsey, from his first marriage, and two grandchildren. Mr. Lipsey got his start in the publishing business when he joined an Omaha company that distributed two free weeklies. Within 15 years, he had expanded it to become the Sun Newspapers, a chain of seven paid-subscription weeklies and five that were distributed free. Mr. Lipsey was introduced to Mr. Buffett in 1969 and later sold the company to Berkshire Hathaway, which had only $50 million in assets then, compared with more than $550 billion today. The Sun weeklies were hungry for exclusives in their competition with daily newspapers, Mr. Lipsey recalled. Mr. Buffett suggested that a reporter for The West Omaha Sun go to Washington and retrieve the federal form on which charities like Boys Town are required to disclose their contributions and assets. While it was common knowledge that Boys Town had become flush, the extent of its assets was stunning. The data on the federal form ''was about the most important piece of information we could lay our hands on,'' Mr. Lipsey told Bloomberg TV in 2012. In Buffalo, as publisher of The News, Mr. Lipsey led the paper as it won its battle for survival with The Courier-Express, its rival, which stopped publication in 1982. In 1999, he appointed the first woman to hold the post of editor of The News, Margaret M. Sullivan. (She was later the public editor of The New York Times and is now the media columnist for The Washington Post.) This year, Mr. Lipsey was among a group of investors who bought the daily newspaper The Berkshire Eagle in Massachusetts. He was credited with encouraging Mr. Buffett to invest in community newspapers again in 2012. ''The best news in the newspaper industry is Berkshire's acquisition of all those newspapers,'' Donald E. Graham, the former chairman of The Washington Post Company, told The Buffalo News recently, ''and that wouldn't have happened without Stan.''"
60028,PROF. JOHN PARRY OF HARVARD; HISTORIAN OF SEA EXPLORATION,"John Horace Parry, a historian of the seas and the men who sailed them for trade and conquest, died Wednesday of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Mass.","John Horace Parry, a historian of the seas and the men who sailed them for trade and conquest, died Wednesday of a heart attack at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 68 years old. Professor Parry came to this country from his native Britain in 1965 to join the history department of Harvard University as Gardiner Professor of Oceanic History and Affairs. He was the author of 10 books chronicling the era of seaborne discoverers and traders from the 15th through 18th centuries. At the time of his death, he was preparing a book on the times of Captain Cook. He was born April 26, 1914. He spent some student years at Harvard before earning his doctorate at Cambridge University in 1938. His academic career was interrupted by five years of service in the Royal Navy in World War II, and he was awarded the Order of the British Empire. Wrote on Spanish Empire His first book, ''The Spanish Theory of Empire,'' was published while he was on naval duty in 1940. Among his more recent volumes published in this country was ''The Spanish Seaborne Empire'' in 1966, relating the exploits of Cortes, Pizarro and other conquistadors. ''The barbarous courage and the brutal splendor of the conquest are not scanted by Mr. Parry,'' Charles Poore wrote, reviewing the book in The New York Times. ''But he also gives us much more precise knowledge about what went on from day to day, what people ate, how they established wages for slavery and or peonage, and so on, than we get from the pageantry school of historians.'' Professor Parry's later books included ''The Discovery of the Sea'' (1974) and ''The Discovery of South America'' (1979). After his naval service, he became a tutor and lecturer at Cambridge and then taught at University College of the West Indies. He was a visiting professor of history at Harvard in the mid-1950's before serving for four years as principal of University College in Ibadan, Nigeria. Before his 1965 return to Harvard, Professor Parry served at University College of Swansea, Wales, and as vice chancellor of the University of Wales. He is survived by his wife, the former Joyce Carter; a son, Michael, and three daughters, Joanna, Katherine and Elizabeth."
30106,"James S. Ackerman, Author of Enduring Books on Architecture, Dies at 97",Mr. Ackerman's passion for architecture was kindled while serving in Italy with the Army. His studies of Michelangelo and Palladio are classics in the field.,"Mr. Ackerman's passion for architecture was kindled while serving in Italy with the Army. His studies of Michelangelo and Palladio are classics in the field. James S. Ackerman, a Harvard art historian whose studies of the architecture of Michelangelo and Palladio remain classics in the field, died on Dec. 31 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 97. The death was confirmed by his wife, Jill Slosburg-Ackerman. Mr. Ackerman plunged into the study of architecture while serving in Italy with the Army at the end of World War II. While awaiting a transfer back to the United States, he volunteered to work for the Monuments and Fine Arts Commission in Milan. He was given the assignment of retrieving archives that had been stored for safety in Pavia, in the monastery complex known as the Certosa. A flame was kindled. His immersion in the Certosa di Pavia generated a master's thesis at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York, where he earned a doctorate in 1952. While teaching art history at the University of California, Berkeley, he was approached by the art historians Anthony Blunt and Rudolf Wittkower to write a survey of Michelangelo's architecture for a series of architectural monographs they were editing. ""The Architecture of Michelangelo,"" published in two volumes in 1961, was greeted as an indispensable work on an overlooked subject. In the first volume, a dozen essays aimed at the educated general reader discussed the artist's major building projects, which included the Laurentian Library and the Medici Chapel in Florence and the Farnese Palace and St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. In the second volume, each project was discussed with full scholarly apparatus appended. Among other insights, Professor Ackerman showed that many of the more puzzling features in the Laurentian Library were solutions to specific structural problems. He shed new light on the dome of St. Peter's by scrutinizing contemporaneous projects by Michelangelo as he altered the design from a pointed to a hemispherical dome. ""Probably no other architect reveals in his total oeuvre such a continuous strain of fertility and felicity of design, and the greatness of Mr. Ackerman's book is that he constantly makes the reader aware of this,"" the art historian David R. Coffin wrote in The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians in 1962. The Society honored the book with its Hitchcock Award in 1961. Professor Ackerman's study of the late-Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, published in 1966, was written at the behest of the English art historians Hugh Honour and John Fleming for Penguin's ""Architect and Society"" series. In limpid prose, Professor Ackerman summed up his subject's life and career, arguing against the neoclassical view of Palladio as a cold logician. ""Palladio was as sensual, as skilled in visual alchemy, as any Venetian painter of his time,"" he wrote. The Harvard art historian Joseph Koerner told Harvard Gazette that Professor Ackerman's books ""were all milestones in the field - books that seem as perfectly balanced as the buildings they interpreted."" He added, ""He inspired generations of undergraduates and trained many of America's leading scholars and museum professionals."" James Sloss Ackerman was born in San Francisco on Nov. 8, 1919. His father, Lloyd, was a prosperous lawyer. His mother, the former Louise Sloss, was a patron of the arts. After attending the Cate School in Carpinteria, Calif., he studied art and architecture at Yale, earning a bachelor's degree in 1941. His studies at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York were interrupted when he was drafted into the Army in 1942. He served with the Intelligence Corps, translating German command messages in Italy. On returning to the United States, he earned his master's degree at the Institute of Fine Arts in 1947. That year he married Mildred Rosenbaum, a dancer. She died in 1986. In addition to his wife and their son, Jesse, he is survived by three children from his first marriage, Anne, Tony and Sarah Ackerman; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Three years in Rome provided the material for Professor Ackerman's doctoral dissertation, on the work of the Renaissance architect Donato Bramante at the Vatican. It was published in 1954 as ""The Cortile del Belvedere."" ""I discovered material in the Uffizi drawing collection that dealt with the Court of the Belvedere in the Vatican, and the prefect of the Vatican library offered to publish my dissertation in a series on the history of the palace,"" he told College Art Association Newsin 2010. ""I was 29 and had nothing to prove that I was competent to take this on, but then everyone in the Vatican is into faith."" He joined the art department at Harvard in 1960 and remained there until retiring in 1990. In 1969 he accepted a one-year appointment as the Slade professor of fine art at Cambridge University in England. Professor Ackerman followed his study of Palladio with the pamphlet-size ""Palladio's Villas"" (1967), an expanded version of Chapter 2 of ""Palladio,"" and ""The Villa: Form & Ideology of Country Houses"" (1990), a study of country houses from Roman times to the era of Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. ""Distance Points: Studies in Theory and Renaissance Art and Architecture"" (1991) collected seven of his essays on Renaissance critical theory and the relationship between architecture and science, as well as studies of Leon Battista Alberti and Leonardo da Vinci. It included his earliest published work, the celebrated essay ""'Ars Sine Scientia Nihil Est': Gothic Theory of Architecture at the Cathedral of Milan,"" published in The Art Bulletin in 1949. He was the editor, with Wolfgang Jung, of ""Conventions of Architectural Drawing: Representation and Misrepresentation"" (2000) and the author of the essay collection ""Origins, Imitation, Conventions"" (2002). In October, Yale University Press published the essay collection ""Origins, Invention, Revision: Studying the History of Art and Architecture."""

He was 46. A police spokeswoman refused to identify the dead man fully, saying only that a 46-year-old with the surname Cheung had died in hospital after falling from the 24th floor of the Mandarin Hotel. Cable Television reported that Mr. Cheung had left a note saying he was suffering from emotional problems. Mr. Cheung was one of Hong Kong's most popular performers, notable for being one of only a few Asian stars to play openly gay characters. One of his most famous gay roles was in the 1997 movie ""Happy Together,"" directed by Wong Kar-wai. Mr. Cheung entered show business after returning to Hong Kong after studies at Leeds University in northern England. He achieved success as a pop singer and enjoyed fame throughout Asia with his successful 1981 album ""The Wind Blows On."" His success as a singer quickly paved the way for a career in film. Though he was to become noted for playing gay roles later in his career, Mr. Cheung made his breakthrough playing a rookie cop alongside Chow Yun-fat in John Woo's 1986 action movie ""A Better Tomorrow."" Two years later he earned a reputation for romantic roles after playing an opium-smoking playboy in Stanley Kwan's ""Rouge,"" one of the most successful films to emerge from Hong Kong during the 1980's.

27404,"Anthony Beilenson, Congressman Who Fought for Abortion Rights, Dies at 84","Anthony Beilenson, a 10-term congressman who persuaded fellow California legislators and Gov.","Anthony Beilenson, a 10-term congressman who persuaded fellow California legislators and Gov. Ronald Reagan 50 years ago to approve what was then one of the nation's most permissive abortion rights bills, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 84. His son, Dr. Peter Beilenson, said the cause was heart failure. New York-born, Mr. Beilenson was, by most measures, a liberal Democrat. He favored civil rights, gun control and environmental causes and refused to accept contributions from political action committees. But he was also an unpredictable iconoclast. He opposed, for one thing, the creation of a federal Department of Education; education, he argued, was a state responsibility. He was against making the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday; federal government employees, he said, already had enough days off. And he was against officially celebrating Grandparents' Day; it was a sop to the greeting card industry, he said. In 1989, as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he urged Washington to discontinue military aid to Afghan rebels fighting Soviet invaders. Some of that money eventually made its way to allies of Osama bin Laden. He also championed wilderness conservation in California. His biggest accomplishment in the State Legislature was the first liberalization of California's abortion law in a century, passed in 1967. ''At the time it became law, no one anticipated that the Supreme Court would discover a constitutional right to abortion, as it did in Roe v. Wade in 1973,'' Lou Cannon, his friend, a Reagan biographer and a former reporter for The Washington Post, wrote recently on RealClearPolitics.com. ''Instead,'' Mr. Cannon wrote, ''it was believed that the abortion rights battle would be fought in state legislatures, and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has suggested that the United States might be more accepting of abortion rights if that had happened. Beilenson told me he also believed this.'' Arguing that thousands of women were dying from back-channel abortions -- the procedure was permitted only when a woman's life was endangered -- Mr. Beilenson persuaded the Senate president to consider liberalizing the law. Mr. Reagan agreed to sign a bill passed by a bipartisan majority. Mr. Beilenson crafted a compromise that legalized abortion in cases of rape or incest, or when a woman's mental or physical health was at risk. The Legislature approved it, and Mr. Reagan signed it, though he later said he regretted his decision. ''He helped shape Reagan's positive response to women's right to choose and progressive changes in the state tax laws,'' Robert Dallek, the presidential historian, said in an email on Friday. ''In Congress, he served with distinction on the House Intelligence Committee. As an ex-congressman, he avoided the sort of money-making avenues that open to so many of them. His was a voice of reason in the era of Vietnam, the Cold War, and Watergate and so much since.'' Anthony Charles Beilenson was born on Oct. 26, 1932, in New Rochelle, N.Y., to Peter Beilenson and the former Edna Rudolph, founders of the Peter Pauper Press, which published classic books that, as they put it, even a pauper could afford. He graduated from Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts, earned a bachelor's degree in government from Harvard in 1954 and graduated from Harvard Law School. He joined his cousin's entertainment law practice in Los Angeles. Besides his son Peter, a former Baltimore health commissioner, Mr. Beilenson is survived by his wife, the former Dolores Martin; another son, Adam; a daughter, Dayna Beilenson; and nine grandchildren. He said he had been inspired to enter politics by a speech he heard at Harvard on the plight of migrant workers by Helen Gahagan Douglas, a former Democratic House member. She was defeated in 1950 when she ran for the United States Senate against a fellow California congressman, Richard M. Nixon, whom she called ''Tricky Dick'' after he accused her of Communist sympathies. Mr. Beilenson served in the State Assembly from 1963 to 1966 and the State Senate from 1967 to 1976, representing all of Los Angeles in what was then, before one-person, one-vote, the most populous legislative district in the nation. He was then elected to Congress from a district that Ms. Douglas had represented. Mr. Beilenson was fiercely independent. He supported the death penalty for drug lords, limits on legal immigration (to reduce competition with citizens for jobs) and, at one point, would have denied automatic citizenship to American-born children of illegal immigrants, saying it would be too costly to provide them with health and welfare benefits. Regardless of his positions, Mr. Beilenson was repeatedly singled out by his colleagues and constituents for his integrity. He retired at the beginning of 1997 because he was disgusted, he said, with the partisan rancor that appeared to make compromise in Congress impossible. ''What has really bothered me about the congressional environment now is all this ideological and mindless politics,'' he told The Los Angeles Times after deciding not to seek re-election. ''Moderate, sensible, middle-of-the-road resolutions of issues seem no longer possible.'' Read more obituaries and follow our coverage on Twitter."

He was 47 years old. Mr. Stewart had been with the Rolling Stones since their days as part of the early-1960's London blues community. Although he was not an official member of the band - he did not fit in with the Stones' tough public image, and was eased out of the group in 1963 - he recorded with the Stones. He also worked as the group's road manager and appeared onstage in recent tours as a sideman. He appeared in the 1983 tour documentary ''Let's Spend the Night Together.'' Like the Rolling Stones, Mr. Stewart was fascinated by American blues and rhythm-and-blues, and was part of a loose community of blues musicians around London. Led Zeppelin, part of that scene, dedicated ''Boogie With Stu'' to him. He had his own part-time blues band, named Rocket 88, and the group released an album on Atlantic Records. His most recent appearance in New York was at the Ronnie Lane Appeal for A.R.M.S., a British rock benefit at Madison Square Garden. He was also the concert's road manager.

47146,"Stanley Steingut, 69, Ex-Speaker Of New York Assembly, Dies at 69","Former New York State Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut, the Brooklyn Democrat who was a longtime power in state politics, died early yesterday at the Tisch-University Hospital.","Former New York State Assembly Speaker Stanley Steingut, the Brooklyn Democrat who was a longtime power in state politics, died early yesterday at the Tisch-University Hospital. He was 69 years old and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Mr. Steingut's elder son, Robert, said he had been suffering from lung cancer and died of pneumonia after being admitted to the hospital on Monday. Stanley Steingut was Speaker of the Assembly from 1975 through 1978 and minority leader from 1969 through 1974. At his death he was the senior partner in the Manhattan law firm of Berger & Steingut. ''The death of Stanley Steingut saddens us all,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch said yesterday, adding, that he ''was a strong legislative leader and served the people of the state well.'' Succeeded His Father He served in the State Assembly from 1952 through 1978, when he unexpectedly lost his Assembly seat. He was succeeded as Speaker by Stanley Fink, another Brooklyn Democrat. Mr. Steingut served as Brooklyn Democratic chairman from 1962 to 1969 and was also a Democratic district leader. His father, Irwin, was a Democratic Assemblyman from Brooklyn from 1922 until 1952, when his son succeeded him in the district in the Crown Heights section. The elder Mr. Steingut was minority leader from 1928 to 1952 and Speaker in 1935. Stanley Steingut's defeat in 1978 was ascribed by many political observers to inadequate attention to his home district. It was said that he had become too caught up in Albany and state affairs. He was defeated in the 1978 Democratic primary by Murray Weinstein, a political unknown, who went on to beat him narrowly in the general election - in which Mr. Steingut ran on the Liberal Party line. 'Special Interests' Asserted ''Twenty-six years of public service is a long career,'' Mr. Steingut said, conceding defeat at the time. ''I pray I have used these years well.'' The campaign against Mr. Steingut had concentrated on his opposition to the death penalty and also on a contentions that he was a ''champion of the special interests,'' which he said was ''a smear.'' During his Assembly career, he was a member of the joint legislative committee on physical handicaps and on mental retardation, an area where he was particularly active. He was also chairman of the Joint Committee on Child Care Needs. In the 1950's, as a member of the Assembly, Mr. Steingut and a Republican colleague, Earl Brydges, sponsored legislation that provided for a variety of special services for children and adults in New York State. As minority leader, he worked hard, often getting up at 5:30 A.M. He sometimes woke up local Democratic leaders with phone calls before 6 A.M. simply to ask what was happening in their areas. He was a lackluster public speaker but got along well with many other political figures. He was also shrewd, street-smart, deeply versed in Democratic politics and wary of reporters. Early Political Experience On his last day in the Assembly, on Dec. 7, 1978, Mr. Steingut lifted his big speaker's gavel, said ''Here it goes'' -and pounded it, bringing his elective political career to a close. He blew kisses to the members of the Assembly. Mr. Steingut was born May 20, 1920, in the Crown Heights section. He attended the Peddie School and Union College. He gained political experience early in life, learning to ring doorbells beside his father. He served in the Navy during World War II, went on to graduate from St. John's University Law School and was admitted to the New York bar in 1950. After losing his Assembly seat, Mr. Steingut, who had earlier been a partner in an insurance business, served more than a year as chairman of the New York State Sports Authority. He also went back to the law, initially as counsel to the firm of Baskin & Sears and later as partner in Berger & Steingut. Mr. Steingut was a member of the finance committee of Mayor-elect David N. Dinkins's campaign organization this year. Mr. Steingut was a founder and a trustee of Touro College. He was awarded honorary degrees from Union College and Polytechnic University and was the recipient of many awards. He is survived by his wife, the former Madeline Fellerman; two sons, Robert - an investment banker who is a former chairman of the state Workers' Compensation Board and a former City Council member at large from Brooklyn - of Manhattan, and Theodore, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Ilene Steingut Vallifuoco of Rome, and four grandchildren.

Lasker, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and fund-raiser for prominent Republicans like former President Richard M. Nixon and former Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York City, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.","Bernard J. Lasker, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and fund-raiser for prominent Republicans like former President Richard M. Nixon and former Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York City, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan and in Greenwich, Conn. He died of heart failure after an illness of several weeks, said James J. Fuld, a lawyer and friend of Mr. Lasker. A native New Yorker and self-made businessman, known as Bunny, Mr. Lasker was probably best known as the chairman of the Big Board in 1970, when stock prices fell sharply and public confidence in the financial markets was sorely tested. Mr. Lasker shuttled between Washington and Wall Street, meeting with President Nixon and others to stabilize the stock market. 'Iron Sense of Duty' To steady the financial system, Mr. Lasker helped orchestrate an orderly consolidation of the brokerage industry during that period, insuring that smaller, faltering firms could be taken over by larger, stronger firms. In ""The Go-Go Years,"" a narrative chronicle of the 1968-70 period on Wall Street, the author John Brooks credited Mr. Lasker with playing a key role in helping the brokerage industry through the crisis, writing that he was ""by all accounts and evidences a man of iron sense of duty and scrupulous professional rectitude."" William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the stock exchange, praised Mr. Lasker's contributions to the financial industry. ""Bernard Lasker brilliantly led the New York Stock Exchange during a period of revolutionary change,"" Mr. Donaldson said. ""In the decades he served on Wall Street, Bunny was held in the highest regard by everyone in the industry."" Mr. Lasker was born in Manhattan in 1910, the son of a sponge-and-chamois importer on Beaver Street. After attending the Franklin School, a private New York high school, he began his career on Wall Street in 1927 at the age of 17, as a runner for Hirsch, Lilienthal & Company. He rose steadily from carrying buy-and-sell orders and messages, to the sales-and-purchase department and assistant manager of a branch office. In 1939, he became a member of the New York Stock Exchange and, by 1968, he had become senior partner of his own firm, Lasker, Stone & Stern. In 1969, Mr. Lasker was elected chairman of the board of governors of the New York Stock Exchange and served in that post until 1971. Delegate to Conventions As a youth, Mr. Lasker applied to the United States Military Academy but was not accepted, Mr. Fuld said. Still, his fondness for West Point was undiminished and, in later life, he enthusiastically supported the academy and was honored for his services. In 1984, he was named the chairman of the board of visitors, and Sept. 30, 1989, was declared ""Bunny Lasker Day"" at West Point. In 1990, he became the first honorary letterman at the academy. For a quarter of a century, Mr. Lasker was active in Republican politics, mainly as a fund-raiser. In 1965, he was the chairman of the finance committee for Mr. Lindsay, who ran for Mayor as a Republican. Mr. Lasker served as a delegate to the Republican conventions in 1968, 1972 and 1976, and was the co-chairman of the Republican national finance committee from 1976 through 1986. As a benefactor, Mr. Lasker contributed his time and money to several medical institutions including Mount Sinai Hospital, New York Hospital and the San Francisco Heart Institute. He was also a trustee for the Jewish Guild for the Blind and an active fund-raiser for the United Jewish Appeal-Federation. Mr. Lasker retired from his Wall Street firm in 1989. His name and his nickname surfaced briefly in one of Wall Street's insider-trading cases in the 1980's, but he was never accused of any wrongdoing. In the case, the phrase ""your bunny has a good nose"" was mentioned by an investment banker to another stock trader as a way of confirming speculation about a corporate takeover deal passed on by Mr. Lasker. He is survived by his wife, Lesley; a son, John, president of Camp Beverly Hills, a retail clothing-store chain based in Beverly Hills, Calif., and a daughter, Joan Sobel Lasker, vice president of corporate public relations for Cosmair Inc., a cosmetics company."
30257,"Philip Davis, 90; Stood Up for the Right to Sit","Philip Davis, who practiced law so unobtrusively for more than two-thirds of a century that he made his biggest legal splash as a disgruntled railroad passenger, died on March 26 at a retirement home in Basking Ridge, N.J.","Philip Davis, who practiced law so unobtrusively for more than two-thirds of a century that he made his biggest legal splash as a disgruntled railroad passenger, died on March 26 at a retirement home in Basking Ridge, N.J. He was 90 and twice went to court to establish the revolutionary notion that a railroad ticket entitles a passenger to an actual seat. A native of the Bronx who worked his way through Fordham Law School as the chief usher at the old Strand Theater on Broadway, Mr. Davis, who retired in October, spent 67 years as a single practitioner specializing in wills and estates, a humdrum area of the law that earned him little notice beyond his clients. But as the once mighty New York Central Railroad learned to its dismay, Mr. Davis was also a stickler for his rights. His pioneering excursion into consumer law began on July 12, 1936, when as a young lawyer who had been vacationing at Lake George, he boarded a New York Central train in Albany and was forced to stand during the entire trip to New York, which took 2 hours and 44 minutes. Mr. Davis, whose aggravation was aggravated by a painful sunburn, lodged a protest with the railroad the next day. When it fell on deaf ears, he filed suit seeking the refund of his $2.80 fare plus $45 for ""inconvenience, physical discomfort, mental aggravation and breach of contract,"" a not-so-arbitrary amount that kept the suit under the $50 limit for swift action in New York's old Municipal Court. When the case came to trial that December, the judge threw it out, ruling that state laws -- which required trains to provide ""sufficient accommodation"" as well as ""adequate,"" ""just"" and ""reasonable"" service -- did not obligate the railroad to provide a seat ""under all or any circumstances."" The matter might have ended there had Mr. Davis been a shade less tenacious, but he appealed, and seven months later, in July 1937, the Appellate Term of State Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the judge had erred and that it was up to a jury to decide what was reasonable under the circumstances. In March 1938, a jury ruled in Mr. Davis's favor, prompting an appeal by the railroad, first to the Appellate Term, which upheld the verdict in November 1938, and then to the Appellate Division, which unanimously sustained the judgment in April 1939. On June 16 of that year, the Appellate Division rejected the railroad's request for permission to appeal further, and three weeks later, on July 7, 1939, almost three years after Mr. Davis's fateful trip, a railroad representative called at Mr. Davis's office at 535 Fifth Avenue and handed him a cash payment of $232.89, an amount that included court costs and interest on the original jury award. Mr. Davis would have been content with one landmark legal victory, but some railroads never learn. Thirty-two years later, on Aug. 10, 1971, Mr. Davis, by then a 63-year-old lawyer in midcareer, was forced to stand on a trip from Grand Central Terminal to North White Plains, and once again he was back in court, this time with a suit against the New York Central's successor, the Penn Central Railroad, seeking a return of his $1.80 fare plus $10 for ""discomfort."" When the case went to trial in Queens Civil Court on Sept. 11, 1971, a jury awarded Mr. Davis, a longtime Queens resident, the full $11.80 he had sought in a verdict that was hailed for extending the same rights to commuters that Mr. Davis had previously established for passengers on long-distance trains. This time there was no appeal, but as Guy Adami, who had represented Penn Central in the case, recalled on Wednesday, the railroad did not change its seating policies, either. Today, with the demise of private railroads in New York, the Davis precedents are moot. Neither Metro-North nor the Long Island Rail Road guarantees seats to commuters, and Amtrak, operating under Federal authority, makes it explicit that passengers who do not book reserved seats may have to stand. While his legal challenges might suggest that he was prickly, Mr. Davis was in fact a gregarious man, who organized his law school class reunions and even formed an alumni association of Strand ushers. Still, he was a stickler for his rights. In his later years, as his children, both lawyers, recalled, he was forever challenging Medicare decisions limiting his medical benefits -- and winning. Mr. Davis, who was married for 60 years, is survived by his wife, Miriam; a son, Jed Davis of Fayette, Me.; a daughter, Jennifer Chaitman of Frenchtown, N.J.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild."

He was 78 years old and lived in Haverford, Penn., and Westport Point, Mass. The cause was pneumonia, his wife, Rachel, said. Mr. Mustin was the grandson of Frank Fleer, who founded Fleer in Philadelphia in the 1880's. It produced a variety of flavorings and confections, including Chiclets. Fleer is also widely believed to have invented bubble gum in 1928, when the company produced what it named Dubble Bubble; a company accountant, Walter E. Diemer, is often credited with having made it accidentally. Dubble Bubble became a household name, not only because chewers could blow bubbles with it but also because it had cartoons, featuring the adventures of a pudgy youth named Pud, folded inside the wax paper wrappers. Mr. Mustin started at Fleer in 1949 and became its president in 1959. By then, the company was in tough competition with Topps, which made Bazooka bubble gum. Topps had a lock on the lucrative baseball trading card business, because the Federal Trade Commission had upheld its exclusive contracts with major league baseball players for the use of their pictures on cards included with the gum. Fleer had long sold trading cards of movie stars and other personalities with its gum, and it occasionally attempted to enter the baseball card business, too, but with little success. In 1975, however, Fleer began a long antitrust case against Topps. Fleer won in Federal District Court in 1980 and began offering the player cards with its bubble gum in 1981. But Topps appealed successfully that same year. But Fleer contended that the exclusive Topps contracts covered only cards packaged with gum or candy, not cards sold with other items, like stickers carrying the logos of major-league ball teams. More lawsuits ensued. In 1983, Fleer and Topps settled out of court; Fleer could continue to sell cards, but not with gum. The settlement opened the door to several other companies, including the Donruss Company of Memphis, to enter the business. Today, Topps and Fleer are among the largest baseball card companies in the country. Mr. Mustin retired in 1989, the year Fleer was sold to Marvel Entertainment. It was sold again earlier this year to a group of private investors and renamed Fleer Skybox of Mount Laurel, N.J. The company no longer sells Dubble Bubble gum; Marvel sold the gum division off separately. Mr. Mustin was born on July 17, 1921, in Lansdowne, Penn., and graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942. During World War II, he led a team at the DeLavall Corporation in Trenton, N.J., that built and tested a turbo supercharger for Navy fighter planes. He later taught engineering for several years at Swarthmore. He was also active in numerous Quaker and community organizations and was a member of the board of the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania. In addition to his wife, Mr. Mustin is survived by five children, Henry Mustin of Seattle, Barclay Mustin of Chimacum, Wash., Walter Mustin of Grand Cayman, British West Indies, Margery M. Howe of West Chester, Penn., and Laura M. Burn of Port Townsend, Wash.; four stepchildren, Sharon Hare of Los Angeles, Diana Hare of Philadelphia, Mally Hare of Amherst, Mass., and Christopher Hare of Albuquerque, N.M.; a brother, Frank Mustin of Lansdowne; a sister, Alice M.

43744,"Denis Mack Smith, 97, Chronicler of Italy","Denis Mack Smith, whose myth-destroying interpretation of Italian unification infuriated many Italian historians but established him as the pre-eminent British writer on modern Italy, died on July 11 at his home in Oxford, England.","Denis Mack Smith, whose myth-destroying interpretation of Italian unification infuriated many Italian historians but established him as the pre-eminent British writer on modern Italy, died on July 11 at his home in Oxford, England. He was 97. In his first book, ''Cavour and Garibaldi, 1860: A Study in Political Conflict,'' published in 1954, Mr. Smith took a cold look at the politics and personalities involved in the Risorgimento, the movement that forged a unified Italian state from a disparate collection of regional kingdoms. For Italian historians, this was a glorious chapter in their country's history, a heroic national struggle, brilliantly planned and executed, leading to the creation of a liberal democracy. Marshaling extensive and persuasive documentary evidence, and writing in a clear, urbane style, Mr. Smith told a less romantic story. Modern Italy, he asserted, was forged in bitter conflict, with elites pitted against elites, church against state, north against south, and the great powers pulling strings. Idols emerged tarnished. Count Camillo Cavour, hitherto regarded as the cleareyed genius behind reunification, emerged as a scheming, often impulsive, trickster. Giuseppe Garibaldi, rather than a dashing warrior, emerged as a waffler, and Victor Emanuel II, Italy's first king, as a feckless playboy. Mr. Smith, the historian David Gilmour wrote in the British newspaper The Independent in 1997, ''upset a well-defended orthodoxy that had been entrenched for almost a century.'' In ''Italy: A Modern History,'' published in 1959, Mr. Smith caused further outrage by refusing to regard Italian fascism and the rise of Benito Mussolini as an aberration. The causes, he insisted, could be traced to longstanding political tendencies and to structural weaknesses in the Italian system, a legacy of the Risorgimento. ''There are not many historians who matter,'' the historian Jonathan Steinberg wrote in The London Review of Books in 1985. ''Not many whose works have changed the way people see themselves. Of that little list, there is an even smaller number whose works have mattered to those in another society.'' Mr. Smith was one of them, he asserted, a writer whose early work ''told many Italians what they did not want to hear, but told them at a special point in their history when they had no choice but to listen.'' David Mack Smith was born on March 3, 1920, in London to Wilfrid Smith, a tax collector, and the former Altiora Gauntlett. He attended St. Paul's Cathedral Choir School and Haileybury College in Hertfordshire, where he won a scholarship to study history at Peterhouse College, Cambridge. Along the way, he taught himself Italian. After teaching at Clifton College in Bristol and serving in the war cabinet, he immersed himself in historical archives in Sicily, an experience that later bore fruit in his two-volume work ''A History of Sicily'' (1968), written with Moses Finley. In 1947 he became a fellow at Peterhouse, where he taught until he was elected a senior research fellow at All Souls College, Oxford, in 1962. He retired in 1987. His first marriage, to Ruth Hellmann (later Viscountess Runciman) ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Catharine Stevenson; two daughters, Sophie and Jacintha; and four grandchildren. If Mr. Smith offended professional historians, he found a receptive audience with Italian readers, who made ''Italy: A Modern History'' a runaway best seller, one of the most popular academic works ever published in Italy. His ideas were greeted warmly by Italian leftists, who regarded the Risorgimento as a failed revolution, but his sheer readability also contributed to sales. The book aged well. An expanded version was published by the University of Michigan Press in 1997 as ''Modern Italy: A Political History.'' Mr. Smith wrote several biographies of the leading figures of the Risorgimento, notably ''Garibaldi: A Great Life in Brief'' (1956), ''Cavour'' (1985) and ''Mazzini'' (1994), as well as the studies ''Victor Emanuel, Cavour and the Risorgimento'' (1971) and ''Italy and Its Monarchy'' (1989). He also wrote two works on Mussolini and the fascist period, ''Mussolini's Roman Empire'' (1971) and ''Mussolini: A Biography'' (1981). He was the editor of ''The Making of Italy, 1796-1870'' (1968) and ''Great Lives Observed: Garibaldi'' (1969)."
26591,"Antonio de Spinola, 86, a Bridge To Democracy for the Portuguese","Antonio de Spinola, the monocled general who served briefly as Portuguese President following the 1974 coup that set the country on the road to democracy, died today.","LISBON, Aug. 13 Antonio de Spinola, the monocled general who served briefly as Portuguese President following the 1974 coup that set the country on the road to democracy, died today. He was 86. He died in a military hospital in Lisbon, where he had been receiving treatment for respiratory problems since 1995, military officials said. General Spinola was a product of the dictatorial regime of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, but he was named President in the aftermath of the April 1974 military coup that overthrew the Government of Marcello Caetano, who had succeed Salazar following the dictator's stroke in 1968. After five months in office, a feud between factions within the Junta of National Salvation, which Mr. Spinola had headed, prompted him to resign. The following year he was accused of trying to organize a countercoup and he was forced to flee Portugal for Brazil. He returned in 1976, but left political life. Antonio Sebastiao Ribeiro de Spinola was born in Estremoz, Portugal, on April 11, 1910. His father later served as an inspector-general of finance during the Salazar dictatorship. Salazar, a family friend, encouraged him in his military career. As a military officer, General Spinola earned a reputation for toughness and valor and became one of Portugal's most decorated soldiers. He led Portugal's wars against independence movements in its African colonies, and served as Governor of Portuguese Guinea from 1968 to 1972. He incurred the wrath of the Caetano regime early in 1974, however, with the publication of a book, ""Portugal and the Future,"" in which he argued that Portugal could not win a military victory against the liberation movements in its African colonies. He proposed instead a political settlement that would give Portuguese Guinea, Angola and Mozambique territorial status within a federal structure. As a result, the Caetano Government dismissed him from his post as deputy chief of the armed forces general staff. Within two months, young left-leaning junior officers in the Portuguese military staged the coup that overthrew the Caetano Government and turned to General Spinola to serve as the country's President. In its early days, Mr. Spinola's new Government disbanded the secret police, freed political prisoners, allowed political exiles to return to Portugal, and abolished press censorship. The independence of Guinea-Bissau, as the former Portuguese Guinea was renamed, was recognized by Lisbon in 1974 and that of the remaining African colonies the following year. With his trademark monocle, leather gloves and riding crop, he did not look the part of the left-wing rebel. But with Portugal threatened by anarchy and possible bloodshed, he moved the country on the road toward a democracy after 40 years of authoritarian rule. He was replaced by Gen. Francisco da Costa Gomes following his resignation in September, 1974. After returning to Portugal in August, 1976, Mr. Spinola retired from the political spotlight, appearing only on anniversaries of the revolution. He is survived by his widow."

Taylor, a senior judge of the District of Columbia Superior Court whose actions helped to ease conditions for Washington's poor and homeless, died on Monday at her home in Washington. She was 65. The cause was cancer, her family said. Judge Taylor, in a special weekend session in 1989, mandated thorough changes for Washington's homeless shelters, including the addition of 50 beds and an overhaul of safety and sanitation. In 1982, she instructed Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. and housing officials to provide heat and hot water for the tenants of four battered public housing projects. In a child custody case in 1994 involving a couple who were both lawyers, she ruled for the father. Judge Taylor found that while both parents ""clearly love their children very much"" the father was doing the better job of balancing career and family obligations. Her ruling, which was upheld on appeal, also provided for the payment of child support by the mother. The decision was criticized by women's organizations and praised by fathers' rights groups. Harriett Rosen Taylor was born in the Bronx, was reared in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College and Columbia University Law School. She practiced family and labor law in New York and Washington before becoming the District's first administrative law judge in 1976, working in the newly formed Office of Consumer Protection. President Jimmy Carter named her to a 15-year term on the Superior Court bench in 1979. She began a second 15-year term in 1994. She assumed senior status last year to teach a course, ""Effective Lawyering: The View from the Bench,"" at Stanford University, and resumed her judicial role in Washington last month. With a strong interest in legal education, she took part in the Trial Advocacy Workshop at Harvard University and played the judge in many high school and college moot court competitions.

He was 53 and lived on the South Kona Coast of Hawaii. The cause of death was brain cancer, said a publicist for his books. ""If psychedelics don't ready you for the great beyond, then I don't know what really does,"" Mr. McKenna said in December in one of his last public speeches, at the Esalen Institute. Death, he said then, felt close. Mr. McKenna combined a leprechaun's wit with a poet's sensibility to brew a New Age stew with ingredients including flying saucers, elves and the I Ching. The essential seasoning was the psychedelic mushrooms that transformed his life and that he recommended -- in ""heroic doses"" -- for virtually everyone. He lived on the wild side of a wild generation. He dropped acid in San Francisco in the 1960's, smuggled hashish in India and searched the jungles of the Amazon for the magic mushrooms. He told interviewers that he had smoked marijuana every day from the time he was a teenager. In the 1990's, Mr. McKenna gained fame by delivering his drug pitch to a new generation at nightclub ""raves."" ""My real function was to give people permission,"" he said in an article to appear in the May issue of Wired magazine. ""Essentially, what I existed for was to say, 'Go ahead, you'll live through it, get loaded, you don't have to be afraid.' "" In lectures, in recordings and in five books, Mr. McKenna made his case for illegal substances that many experts consider highly dangerous. He had a grand theory: that psychedelic mushrooms are the missing link in the story of human evolution. Not until our primate ancestors began eating hallucinatory psilocybin mushrooms, he contended, did they begin to acquire human qualities. Mr. McKenna, a lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard and deep-set eyes, also professed to know exactly when the world would end: Dec. 22, 2012. He came to this conclusion through a mathematical construct he based on the I Ching, the ancient Chinese book of divination. The package he pushed struck a chord, at least among the usual suspects. Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead called him ""the only person who has made a serious effort to objectify the psychedelic experience."" But experts on drug treatment attacked Mr. McKenna for popularizing dangerous substances. ""Surely the fact that Terence McKenna says that the psilocybin mushroom 'is the megaphone used by an alien, intergalactic Other to communicate with mankind' is enough for us to wonder if taking LSD has done something to his mental faculties,"" Judy Corman, vice president of Phoenix House of New York, a drug treatment center, said in a letter to The New York Times in 1993. Still others had big trouble with his self-consciously cosmic literary style. ""I suffered hallucinatory agonies of my own while reading his shrilly ecstatic prose,"" Peter Conrad wrote in The New York Times in a 1993 review of Mr. McKenna's book ""True Hallucinations,"" published by Harper San Francisco. But many marveled at his stream of novel thoughts. ""To write him off as a crazy hippie is a rather lazy approach to a man not only full of fascinating ideas but also blessed with a sense of humor and self-parody,"" Tom Hodgkinson wrote in The New Statesman and Society in 1994. Terence Kemp McKenna was born on Nov. 16, 1946, in a Colorado cattle and coal town, Paonia. He was a youth given to memorizing passages of James Joyce and reading Carl Jung's ""Psychology and Alchemy,"" and his main satisfactions percolated from his fertile imagination. ""I think my first encounter with psychedelics was looking at Colorado and trying to understand that it was once the shores of an ocean with hundred-foot-long sauropods tromping through the mangrove swamps,"" he told Details magazine in 1993. He found his way to San Francisco in 1965. According to the April 1993 issue of Details magazine, Barry Melton, the guitarist for Country Joe & the Fish, introduced him to marijuana in 1965. Soon he tried LSD. He enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley that year and was accepted into the Tussman Experimental College, which emphasized self-direction. After the two-year program, he embarked on travels around the world. In 1971 he and his brother, Dennis, journeyed to the Amazon jungle in search of psychedelic plants. In a tiny mission settlement in southern Colombia, they encountered, for the first time, what drug enthusiasts call ""magic mushrooms."" In 1972, Mr. McKenna returned to Berkeley to finish college. He completed a self-tailored degree in ecology, resource recovery and shamanism. His mind was focused on, and certainly by, mushrooms. No one had yet figured out how to cultivate the mushrooms in the United States, but the McKennas brought the South American secrets home. They published them, and in the 1980's were growing 70 pounds every six weeks. The operation ended when a friend was arrested for his fungi farm. In 1975, the two brothers published their first book, ""The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens and the I Ching."" Mr. McKenna began to lecture both to old hippies and converts to the emerging New Age. According to Wired, he drifted into the role of ""charismatic talking head."" He wrote four books in the early 1990's. In addition to ""True Hallucinations,"" they were ""Food of the Gods"" (Bantam, 1992); ""The Archaic Revival"" (Harper San Francisco) and ""Trialogues at the Edge of the West,"" written with Ralph Abraham and Rupert Sheldrake (Bear & Company, 1992). Mr. McKenna met his wife, Kathleen Harrison, in Jerusalem in the mid-1970's. They settled in Occidental, a small town north of San Francisco. They had a son, Finn, who now lives in Jersey City, N.J., and a daughter, Klea, of Santa Cruz, Calif. He is also survived by his brother, Dennis, who lives in Minneapolis. After a divorce in 1992, Mr. McKenna moved to Hawaii, where he and his former wife owned property. Mr. McKenna built a modernist house, which is topped with a huge antenna dish for the Internet communications with which he became enamored. ""Without sounding too cliche, the Internet really is the birth of global mind,"" he told Wired. ""That's what a god is. Somebody who knows more than you do about whatever you're dealing with."" When he fell ill last May, Mr. McKenna was enjoying a new life with Christy Silness, a young woman he had met the year before at an ethnobotanical conference in the Yucatan. He had medical treatment for glioblastoma multiforma, a rare form of brain cancer, while friends and followers added more esoteric touches. A self-styled ""grand kahuna of Polynesia"" biked up the mountain to meditate at his bedside. A Nevada disk jockey, Art Bell, asked his 13 million listeners to send good vibrations. Wired said Mr. McKenna, like many others, wondered whether a lifetime of drug use might be to blame for his brain tumor. ""So what about it?"" he asked his doctors. ""You want to hammer on me about that?"" They assured him there was no causal link. ""So what about 35 years of daily dope smoking?"" he asked. They pointed to studies suggesting that cannabis may shrink tumors. ""Listen,"" Mr. McKenna told them, ""if cannabis shrinks tumors, we wouldn't be having this discussion."" http://www.nytimes.com"

She was 77 and lived in Beverly Hills.","Tamara Toumanova, a child-prodigy ballerina of the 1930's who became familiar to American audiences as one of the most glamorous stars of 20th-century dance, died on Wednesday at the Santa Monica Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 77 and lived in Beverly Hills. She died after a brief illness, said John Taras, a friend. By the time she was 13, Miss Toumanova was internationally acclaimed as one of the three so-called baby ballerinas of Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes. She and two other phenomenally gifted daughters of Russian emigres -- Irina Baronova and Tatiana Riabouchinska -- were discovered in Parisian ballet studios by George Balanchine. They soon became the talk of London and New York. Adoring fans nicknamed Miss Toumanova ""the black pearl of the Russian ballet."" Even as a teen-ager, her beauty was as remarkable as her technique. Kathrine Sorley Walker, a British dance historian, said of her in ""De Basil's Ballets Russes"" (1983) that with her ""large dark eyes, raven wings of hair and magnolia skin, she combined lyricism and virtuosity to a remarkable degree."" A founding member of the de Basil Ballets Russes in 1932, Miss Toumanova inspired two of this century's greatest choreographers. She created roles in Balanchine's ""Cotillon"" and ""Concurrence"" and in Leonide Massine's ""Jeux d'Enfants"" with the company. She left the following year and was given starring roles by Balanchine in his short-lived troupe Les Ballets 1933. Returning to the Ballets Russes a few months afterward, she danced in the classics as well as in such new works by Massine as ""Choreartium"" and ""Symphonie Fantastique."" Later in her career, she performed with Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and appeared in a number of Hollywood films. Miss Toumanova was born on March 2, 1919, in a boxcar in Siberia. She was the daughter of a czarist army colonel and his wife, who were fleeing the Bolsheviks. The couple settled in Paris, where their daughter became a pupil of Olga Preobrajenska, a Russian-born teacher. Miss Toumanova astonished balletgoers in 1929, at the age of 9, when she appeared at the Paris Opera in ""L'Eventail de Jeanne,"" a ballet with a cast of children. Reviewing the production in the theatrical magazine Comoedia, Andre Levinson, the most famous Parisian ballet critic of the time, called Miss Toumanova's dancing both ""astonishing"" and ""frightening."" When quarrels between de Basil and Massine prompted the choreographer to form his own company, Miss Toumanova became a member of Massine's new Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938. She dropped out of the company the next year to appear in the Broadway musical ""Stars in Your Eyes,"" and rejoined de Basil's company for an Australian tour and the New York season that followed it in 1940. She was once again a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1940 to 1942, and during the 1944-45 season, was a star of Ballet Theater. As she toured the world, Miss Toumanova was accompanied by her mother, Eugenia, one of the most famous of the ""ballet mothers"" of the 1930's. These mothers went everywhere with their daughters, serving as dressers, laundresses, cooks and pet keepers. In addition, the mothers were their daughters' fiercest partisans and sternest critics. Eugenia Toumanova was also said to be fond of fortune telling, faith healing and poker playing. When, as a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Miss Toumanova was cast in the virtuosic Black Swan pas de deux from ""Swan Lake,"" she and her mother would minutely inspect the stage to choose the spot at which the ballerina would perform a notoriously difficult series of whipping turns known as fouettes. Then they would pray over that spot. The fouettes never faltered. Grace Robert, an American dance historian, said of the Black Swan in her ""Borzoi Book of Ballets"" (1946): ""Tamara Toumanova is at her exciting best in this tour de force, its vertiginous turns and sustained balances exactly suiting her temperament and forceful technique."" Miss Toumanova's later career, although a distinguished one, did not always seem as remarkable as her youthful achievements. After leaving Ballet Theater, she became a freelance ballerina, appearing with such companies as the Paris Opera Ballet, London Festival Ballet and the Marquis de Cuevas Grand Ballet. During the 1960's, she toured extensively in South America with Vladimir Oukhtomsky as her partner. She created two notable roles with the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1947, she was a star of ""Le Palais de Cristal,"" the glittering abstract ballet by Balanchine that is known in America as ""Symphony in C."" Three years later, she displayed her dramatic talents in the title role of Serge Lifar's ""Phedre."" Some critics thought Miss Toumanova acquired annoying mannerisms. Reviewing her in the London Festival Ballet production of ""Swan Lake"" in 1955, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, complained that ""her grandiosity (including some incredible bows) smothered the whole work like so much thick chocolate sauce."" Nevertheless, she remained capable of extraordinary performances. Seeing her at the Paris Opera in 1950, the American critic Edward Denby wrote in ""Dancers, Buildings and People in the Streets"" (1965) that he was distressed by her ""careless feet, limp and wormy arms, brutally deformed phrasings"" but that his objections vanished when she offered ""a few terrifying extensions, a few incisive strokes that counted phenomenally."" ""At these moments,"" he went on, ""she had so much vitality she made everyone else look as if they merely crept or scuttled about her while she danced."" Miss Toumanova acted and danced in several movies. She made her screen debut in ""Days of Glory"" in 1944. That same year, she married the film's producer and screen writer, Casey Robinson; the marriage ended in divorce. Miss Toumanova played the ballerina Anna Pavlova in ""Tonight We Sing"" in 1953 and appeared in ""Deep in My Heart"" in 1954. She had a starring role in ""Invitation to the Dance,"" a ballet film directed by Gene Kelly in 1955. She was also in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Torn Curtain"" (1966) and Billy Wilder's ""Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" (1969). Miss Toumanova, who became an American citizen in 1944, lived quietly in later years at her home in Beverly Hills. No immediate family members survive."
37443,"DAME NGAIO MARSH, THE AUTHOR OF 32 MYSTERY NOVELS, DIES AT 82","Dame Ngaio Marsh, whose writing style and vivid characters and settings made her a mystery novelist of world renown, died yesterday at her home in Christchurch, New Zealand.","Dame Ngaio Marsh, whose writing style and vivid characters and settings made her a mystery novelist of world renown, died yesterday at her home in Christchurch, New Zealand. She was 82 years old. At her death, Dame Ngaio had published 31 mystery novels, most of them best sellers, and an autobiography, ''Black Beech and Honeydew.'' A new mystery is scheduled for publication next fall in the United States by Little, Brown & Company. Dame Ngaio described her style, which did not change in the face of changing styles in mysteries, as ''in the line of the original detective story, where a crime is solved calmly.'' Introducing the Inspector A good deal of Dame Ngaio's enduring popularity may be attributed to her creation of Chief Inspector Roderick Alleyn, C.I.D. Though more practical, Alleyn was as charming, imperturbable, scholarly and nearly as suave as Dorothy Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey, that paragon of English detectives. Like Lord Peter, Alleyn married late to a wife, Troy, an artist, who was outspokenly independent. But Dame Ngaio's detective was more down to earth. Named after the Elizabethan actor who founded the college to which Dame Ngaio's father went, Alleyn made his first appearance in 1934 in her first mystery novel, ''A Man Lay Dead.'' ''Alleyn has been in all of them,'' Dame Ngaio said in 1960. ''It would be an affectation to say I'm sick of him. I'm not. I'm completely crazy about him.'' Theater Mysteries Dame Ngaio worked with a wide variety of settings, from London society to the little town of Upper Quintern, from a Riviera resort to the rugged terrain of a sheep ranch in New Zealand. She was probably best known for her theater mysteries. Of ''Night at the Vulcan,'' considered one of her best novels, Anthony Boucher wrote in The New York Times: ''If you've ever felt that the dimming of house lights can be the most important moment in the world, this is your book.'' She was also known for her humor. In ''Tied Up in Tinsel,'' the servants in the venerable mansion in which the murder had occurred were all ex-convicts with murder in their pasts. In ''Prelude to Death,'' the victim is an amateur pianist who insists on playing Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C Minor at every opportunity. He is shot dead on the piano bench at the opening chord. Dame Ngaio was considered a member of a triumvirate of mystery writers that included Miss Sayers and Dame Agatha Christie. ''She has maintained a very high standard,'' Newgate Callendar wrote of Dame Ngaio in 1977 in The New York Times. ''Indeed, she writes better than Agatha Christie ever did: She is more civilized, knows something about the arts, and her characterizations have much more life than Christie's cardboard figures ever did.'' Wrote of What She Knew For the most part, Dame Ngaio wrote of what she knew. ''If you don't write about what you know, you're lke a barrister and have to do a frightful amount of research for each case,'' she once said. Dame Ngaio was born April 23,1899, in a suburb of Christchurch. She was the only child of parents who were active readers, campers and amateur actors, and was educated in New Zealand. She enrolled in art school at 15. While there, she wrote a play that she showed to a touring manager who invited her to join his repertory company. She toured Australia with the troupe, which played modern comedies, for two years. She then turned to writing short stories and magazine features, and went on to become an interior decorator, a rugged traveler and a successful party-giver in London. Dame Ngaio began to write in 1931 when, on a wet London weekend, she read a Sayers story and decided to try her hand. Her novels generally took her eight or nine months to complete. Dame Ngaio was also known for her theater productions in New Zealand, among them a successful 1946 production of ''Macbeth,'' performed to bagpipe music. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1966. The pronunciation of her name remained a genuine mystery to most of Dame Ngaio's readers. It was pronounced ''nyo,'' but its origins were uncertain. ''What does 'Ngaio' mean?'' she once said. ''I don't know. Like many Maori"

Correction Appended Jim Hickman, who supplied batting punch for the Mets during their futile early years and then became an All-Star for the Chicago Cubs, died on Saturday in Jackson, Tenn.","Hickman set milestones on the expansion Mets team of the early '60s with his power hitting before reaching his peak with the Chicago Cubs. Correction Appended Jim Hickman, who supplied batting punch for the Mets during their futile early years and then became an All-Star for the Chicago Cubs, died on Saturday in Jackson, Tenn. He was 79. His death was confirmed by his son Mike, who did not specify the cause. Hickman, a lanky right-handed batter, played in the outfield and at first and third base in a 13-year major league career. In his years with the Mets, from 1962 to 1966, first at the Polo Grounds and then at Shea Stadium, he set several team milestones. He was the first Met to hit three home runs in a single game and the first to hit for the cycle - a single, double, triple and homer in one game. (He did it in that order.) He was also the last Met to hit a home run at the Polo Grounds, connecting off the Philadelphia Phillies' Chris Short on Sept. 18, 1963. Taking advantage of the Polo Grounds' short left-field line, Hickman hit 30 home runs for Casey Stengel's Mets in their first two seasons, when they lost a total of 231 games. His most memorable one came on Aug. 9, 1963, two days after he hit for the cycle against the St. Louis Cardinals, when his grand slam in the ninth inning off the Cubs' Lindy McDaniel gave the Mets a 7-3 victory that ended pitcher Roger Craig's stretch of 18 consecutive losses. Hickman was traded to the Dodgers in November 1966. He was the last Met remaining from the expansion draft that stocked the team's inaugural roster. Dealt to the Cubs after one year in Los Angeles, Hickman was platooned for a while, then flourished at the plate after the Cubs' manager, Leo Durocher, made him a regular late in the 1969 season. He hit 21 homers for the 1969 Cubs, who were overtaken by the long-downtrodden Mets in their startling run to a World Series championship. The next year he hit 32 home runs, drove in 115 runs, batted .315 and was No. 8 in the balloting for the National League's most valuable player. He was also an All-Star that year for the only time in his career. Hickman became a footnote to a notorious moment in All-Star Game history when he delivered a 12th-inning single at the 1970 game in Cincinnati, driving in Pete Rose with the winning run. Rose scored when he barreled into the American League catcher, Ray Fosse, instead of sliding, and severely injured Fosse's shoulder. Drawing a stark contrast between Hickman and many of his teammates after he drove in the winning run in a victory over the Dodgers in June 1970, Durocher remarked, ""He gives you not 100 but 150 percent on the field, and some of those guys should be kissing his feet."" Hickman in turn praised Durocher. ""Leo saved me,"" he told chicagobaseballmuseum.org in a 2014 interview. ""I was just a part-time player. He gave me a real good chance to play. After I had a little success, I felt he had a little confidence in me, and that helped me."" James Lucius Hickman was born in Henning, Tenn., on May 10, 1937. He signed with the Cardinals' organization in 1956 and played in their minor league system until he joined the Mets. Having missed three months of the 1966 season with a wrist injury, Hickman was traded to the Dodgers along with Ron Hunt, the Mets' star second baseman, for Tommy Davis, a two-time N.L. batting champion. Hickman played five seasons with the Mets, one with the Dodgers, six with the Cubs and a final year with the Cardinals. He retired after the 1974 season with a .252 career batting average and 159 home runs. In addition to his son Mike, he is survived by three other sons, Jim Jr., Bill and Joey, and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His wife, Juanita, died in 2012. Hickman, who lived in Henning, ran a farm after his retirement from baseball and then became a batting instructor for the Cincinnati Reds' minor league system. ""I tell them I was 32 before I learned to hit,"" he was quoted by George Castle in the 2005 book ""Where Have All Our Cubs Gone?"" ""When a kid's struggling, I'll use that example."" Correction: June 28, 2016, Tuesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Monday about Jim Hickman, who played for the Mets in their early years, erroneously attributed a distinction to him. Rod Kanehl, not Hickman, was the first Met to hit a grand slam. The error was repeated in a subheading."

Solomon, who became famous for training Muhammad Ali, Leon Spinks and Sonny Liston before they became world champion boxers, died of heart failure at St. Ignatius Nursing Home in West Philadelphia on Sunday. He was 83. He began his career as a boxer, fighting more than 300 bouts as an amateur welterweight and lightweight. He began boxing so he could defend himself from bullies in his south Philadelphia neighborhood, his family said. Solomon became a trainer in 1950 because, he said, it was easier than getting punched. He continued to enjoy baseball, which he loved as a teen-ager, and eventually was a catcher in the Negro leagues. In the 1960's, Solomon trained Liston, who lost the belt to the flamboyant Cassius Clay, who later became Muhammad Ali after converting to Islam. Solomon trained other heavyweight champions, including Leon Spinks, Michael Spinks and Trevor Berbick. Solomon stopped training professionally 10 years ago but continued to work with youngsters at the Haddington Recreation Center until a few years ago, when he had to stop because of Alzheimer's disease. Solomon is survived by his wife, Edith; a daughter, Arlen; a stepdaughter, Camille Veasey; a sister; four grandchildren; five great-grandchildren, and three great-great-grandchildren."

29890,"Ben Ammi Ben-Israel, 75; Led Exodus of U.S. Blacks to Israel","Ben Ammi Ben-Israel, a former Chicago metal worker who led a migration of hundreds of fellow black Americans to what they consider their ancestral homeland, Israel, died on Saturday in a hospital in Beersheba, Israel.","Ben Ammi Ben-Israel, a former Chicago metal worker who led a migration of hundreds of fellow black Americans to what they consider their ancestral homeland, Israel, died on Saturday in a hospital in Beersheba, Israel. He was 75. His organization, the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem, announced his death on its website. The cause was not disclosed. To his followers, who called him the father or the holy father, Mr. Ben-Israel was a prophet-like figure who maintained that he had a vision in 1966 in which the angel Gabriel told him to lead an exodus of black Americans to Israel. Since the first African Hebrews arrived there in 1969, the community has grown to about 3,000 members, half of whom were born in Israel. Most live in the city of Dimona, at the edge of the Negev Desert in Israel, and two nearby towns. ''We were returning to be reconciled with the Creator,'' Mr. Ben-Israel said in a 2008 interview with WBEZ, a public radio station in Chicago. The African Hebrews, like many black Americans in a wider movement that sprang up in the early 1900s, believe that their ancestors were biblical Israelites, members of the tribe of Judah who dispersed to West Africa after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Generations later, they say, descendants of those Israelites were taken to America as slaves. Under Israel's Law of Return, any Jew can live there and become a citizen. But the African Hebrews do not consider themselves Jews and refuse to convert. ''That is our tribal origin,'' said Ahmadiel Ben-Yehuda, a spokesman. ''We're not adherents to the religion of Judaism.'' For decades, Israelis regarded the African Hebrews as a strange and possibly dangerous cult. The African Hebrews wear vibrant clothing, follow a vegan diet and do not smoke or drink. Birth control is prohibited. The men often have multiple wives. Since they were not Jews, the Israeli government denied them work permits and health care and threatened to deport them. Mr. Ben-Israel, in turn, lashed out with anti-Semitic remarks and accusations of racism. ''We came here offering 'shalom,' '' Mr. Ben-Israel told The New York Times in 1971. ''We have been met with no jobs, no decent housing and Jim Crow policies similar to what we left behind.'' Later that year, he told The Baltimore Sun that two million blacks from the United States would wrest Israel from its Jewish inhabitants. ''The Lord personally ordered me to take possession of Israel,'' he said. More followers made their way to the African Hebrew compound in Dimona, overstaying tourist visas. Tensions flared anew on April 17, 1986, when the police surrounded the village to prevent a planned protest march. Mr. Ben-Israel made an impassioned proclamation of strength to his followers but without the inflammatory talk of earlier years, and they did not push ahead with the march. ''We're sons and daughters of peace,'' he said. ''We will not leave. We will wait. We will wait.'' In 1990, the Israeli government offered the African Hebrews a path to permanent residency and citizenship. In return, the African Hebrews agreed to stop the flow of new members. The community soon became more entwined with Israeli society. Many of its children who grew up in Israel have served in the country's military. The African Hebrews have opened a small chain of vegan restaurants, and they manufacture tofu cheese for a vegan pizza sold by the Domino's pizza chain. Mr. Ben-Israel became an Israeli citizen in 2013. He was born Ben Carter in Chicago on Oct. 12, 1939. After dropping out of high school, he served three years in the Army while earning his equivalency diploma, Mr. Ben-Yehuda, the spokesman, said. After his discharge he worked as a metallurgist at the Howard Foundry on the West Side of Chicago, where, he recounted, a black co-worker came up to him one day in 1961 and asked, ''Did you know we are descendants of the biblical Israelites?'' Mr. Ben-Israel adopted his Hebrew name after studying the Bible. In the turmoil of the 1960s, he allied himself with those who believed that blacks would be better off leaving the United States than trying to change it from within through the civil rights movement. They established a congregation and a meeting place, calling it the A-Beta Hebrew Israel Cultural Center. Mr. Ben-Israel took about 350 of his followers to Liberia in 1967 as part of what he called a cleansing process, which lasted two and a half years. Some followers died. A few remained in Liberia. Most went back to the United States, but Mr. Ben-Israel and about 140 others went on to Israel. He is survived by four wives, Tikvah, Yoninah, Baht Zion and Baht Ammi; 25 children; 45 grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren. His followers spoke of Mr. Ben-Israel as having been anointed by God to lead them, though he made no claims to being divine, Mr. Ben-Yehuda said. Yet, he said, Mr. Ben-Israel was once asked if he was the messiah, and he answered with a parable: ''Someone came up to two people -- a wise man and a fool -- saying, 'Ben Ammi is the Messiah!' The fool jumped up and said, 'No, he's not!' Whereas the wise man looked around at the state of the world and replied, 'I don't know, but I sure hope that he is!' ''"

He was 67 years old. There have been reports, never confirmed, that he suffered from cancer. Party officials reported that he died of heart failure. His health was also said to have been failing since he underwent bile-duct surgery two years ago. Mr. Abe, a former journalist who once sought to become a kamikaze pilot, was groomed to become Prime Minister, holding every top job in his party and a number of important Cabinet posts. He was Japan's longest-serving postwar Foreign Minister, holding the post from 1982 through 1986, during a time when Japanese-American relations generally grew closer. Done In by Scandal But Mr. Abe fell just short of his political goal when he was caught up in a major influence-peddling scandal, derailing his long and steady climb toward the prime ministership. His involvement in the Recruit scandal of 1988, in which a political secretary accepted unlisted shares in a company seeking influence among top politicians, eliminated him from the race to run the Government. But he continued to lead the second-largest faction in the Liberal Democratic Party. Along with Noboru Takeshita, a former Prime Minister who heads the party's largest faction, Mr. Abe exerted great influence over Japanese politics. In 1989 he became ill, and despite constant suggestions that he might again be considered for the Prime Minister's job, his deteriorating health made that seem unlikely. Mr. Abe was born on April 29, 1924, in Yamaguchi Prefecture, in western Japan. His father became mayor of his hometown and then was elected to Parliament in 1936 as a conservative. After graduating from high school early in 1944, Mr. Abe entered a naval aviation school and volunteered to become a kamikaze pilot. But the war ended before he could undergo special training, and he went on to obtain a law degree from Tokyo University in 1949. After graduation, he became a political reporter for Mainichi Shimbun, a leading national daily. His political career began when he married into a prominent political family. In 1951, he wed Yoko Kishi, the daughter of Nobusuke Kishi, who became Prime Minister a few years later. Elected to Parliament Mr. Abe left journalism in 1956 when his father-in-law was appointed Foreign Minister, and served as his secretary. He remained Mr. Kishi's secretary when Mr. Kishi was named Prime Minister in 1957. In 1958, Mr. Abe was elected to the lower house of Parliament. He was re-elected 10 times. In 1974 his rising stature was confirmed when he was named Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the first of four Cabinet posts he held. Later, he served as chief Cabinet secretary, Minister of International Trade and Industry, and Foreign Minister. Mr. Abe ran unsucessfully for the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party twice -- against Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1982 and Mr. Takeshita in 1987. The job carries with it the Prime Ministership. He became party secretary general in 1987 and was widely regarded as the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Takeshita. But the Recruit scandal brought down Mr. Takeshita, along with other top politicians, and halted Mr. Abe's rise. Remained a Powerful Figure Despite his failing health and infrequent public appearances, Mr. Abe continued as a power broker. His faction holds five of the 20 posts in the Cabinet of the current Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu. Mr. Abe was last seen in public on April 18, when he attended a lunch for the visiting Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He had been hospitalized since January. He is survived by his wife and two sons, Hironobu and Shinzo. A funeral service is scheduled Friday at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo."

48254,"Abby Mann, 'Nuremberg' Screenwriter, Dies at 80","Abby Mann, the screenwriter who brought incisive characterization and a searing sense of justice to ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' and other social dramas, died on Tuesday in Beverly Hills.","Abby Mann, the screenwriter who brought incisive characterization and a searing sense of justice to ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' and other social dramas, died on Tuesday in Beverly Hills. He was 83. The cause was heart failure, his wife, Myra, said. Mr. Mann joined the first rank of screenwriters with ''Judgment at Nuremberg,'' released in 1961. It emerged from a script with the same title that Mr. Mann had written for CBS's ''Playhouse 90'' two years earlier. The movie version won him an Academy Award for screenwriting; Maximilian Schell also won, as best actor. The plot concerned the trial of four German judges accused of using their offices to further Nazi policies. The case was complicated because at the time of the trial, West Germany was emerging as an ally of the United States against the Soviet Union. The crux of the drama is the steely determination of the chief judge, played by Spencer Tracy, to push ahead despite political pressures. In an interview with The New York Post in 1961, Mr. Mann said he sought to examine how patriotism like that motivating the German judges can become an ''evil thing'' that ''divides man from humanity.'' Writing in Commentary, Jason Epstein said the movie, directed by Stanley Kramer, was ''astonishingly intelligent'' and raised ''some of the darkest questions of this dark age.'' Mr. Mann followed his ''Nuremberg'' script with more than four decades of serious dramas, many for movies made for television, a genre he helped pioneer. He won three Emmys for television movies. His scripts, often derived from real cases, delivered withering critiques of the criminal justice system, frequently examining the denial of the rights of the accused. A case in point was ''The Marcus-Nelson Murders'' (1973), based in part on a nonfiction book by Selwyn Raab about the brutal killings of two young, white Manhattan women, Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert. The black man who was accused of those killings and made a forced confession was exonerated when the real killer was found. Mr. Mann's script focused on the prejudice faced by poor and minority suspects. The film was the pilot for the popular television show ''Kojak.'' (Mr. Mann had spelled the name ''Kojack.'') He complained that the resulting series veered from his social and moral vision and became just another formulaic cops-and-robbers potboiler. A biography prepared for the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago said that Mr. Mann's ''exhaustive investigative research'' impressed even critics who considered him left-wing and polemical. ''Most importantly, few have questioned the factual basis of his arguments,'' the museum biography said. Mr. Mann's reputation for integrity extended beyond the moral view in his scripts. When Paramount wanted to cast his screenplay ''A Child Is Waiting,'' about retarded children, with actors who had no disability, Mr. Mann objected. He emptied his bank account and bought back the script. United Artists put out the movie in 1963. Time magazine reported in 1963 that important actors like Mr. Tracy threatened to quit if a word of a Mann script were changed. The magazine also said that Mr. Mann demanded that his name be taken off the credits of his adaptation of Sartre's ''Condemned of Altona'' (1962) unless the original script was restored. The director, Vittorio De Sica, restored the script. Abraham Goodman was born on Dec. 1, 1927, in Philadelphia. The son of a jeweler of German and Jewish extraction, he grew up in East Pittsburgh, a predominantly working-class, Catholic area. His upbringing there gave him sympathy for minorities, he said. He went to Temple University for a year, spent another year in the Army, then studied at New York University under the G.I. Bill. Mr. Mann began his professional career in the early 1950s writing for ''Cameo Theater'' and ''Robert Montgomery Presents'' on NBC and ''Studio One'' and ''Playhouse 90'' on CBS. He was known for arduous research. He got on a freighter in Veracruz, Mexico, to ride to Houston in preparation for his adaptation of Katherine Anne Porter's ''Ship of Fools.'' The film told of the interlocking lives of passengers sailing from Mexico to pre-Hitler Germany. Mr. Mann's screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. Mr. Mann made his directorial debut with ''King,'' a six-hour 1978 mini-series, which he also wrote. Suggesting that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was the victim of a conspiracy, it prompted an inconclusive congressional investigation. Mr. Mann is survived by his wife, the former Myra Maislin; his daughters, Adrienne Isom of Brooklyn and Abigail Mann of Manhattan; his son, Aaron Cohen of Beverly Hills, Calif.; his sister, Esther Goodman Sack of Tequesta, Fla.; and a granddaughter. For all Mr. Mann's success in persuading directors and producers not to fiddle with his work, he was less successful with one sponsor. The American Gas Association vetoed two"

She was 74. Miss London, who lived in the San Fernando Valley, suffered a stroke five years ago and was in poor health, a spokesman for Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center told The Associated Press. She was also an actress in scores of movies and television shows, including the popular role of Nurse Dixie McCall in ""Emergency!"" in the 1970's. Miss London went from playing bit parts in the early 1940's to starring roles and pin-up status among World War II servicemen. Then, in 1947, she married the actor Jack Webb, later famous on ""Dragnet,"" and stopped working to be a full-time wife and mother. After they divorced five years later, she became a serious singer under the tutelage of Bobby Troupe, a jazz musician and songwriter. Her first 45 single, released in 1955, was ""Cry Me a River,"" and it was included on her first album, ""Julie Is Her Name."" More than three million copies of the album and single were sold. She made more than 30 albums. She was voted one of the top female vocalists of 1955, 1956 and 1957. On New Year's Eve 1959, she married Mr. Troupe, who died last year. Adjectives such as sexy, intimate, breathy, husky and suggestive were applied to her singing. The singer herself told Life magazine in 1957: ""It's only a thimbleful of a voice, and I have to use it close to the microphone. But it is a kind of oversmoked voice and it automatically sounds intimate."" Her sound and her looks were closely intertwined. Most of her albums were graced by sultry, yet sophisticated pictures of her. Miss London was born as Julie Peck in Santa Rosa, Calif., on Sept. 26, 1926. Her parents, Jack and Josephine Peck formed a song and dance team in vaudeville and radio. In 1929, they moved to San Bernardino, where her parents had a radio show on which Julie sometimes appeared. In 1941, they moved to Los Angeles and she graduated from Hollywood Professional High School. She then took a job as an elevator operator in a department store where she was discovered by talent agent Sue Carol, the wife of the actor Alan Ladd. She appeared in her first film, ""Nabonga,"" in 1944, and began singing with the Matty Malnech Orchestra. She met Mr. Webb who was then in the Marine Corps. They married in 1947, and she gave up her budding movie career to become a full-time wife and mother. They had two daughters, Stacy and Lisa. They divorced in 1953. After meeting Mr. Troupe she began singing again, recovering some of what she called sagging confidence. Her movie career also revived. She starred as an alcoholic singer in the 1956 film ""The Great Man."" She then starred or co-starred in ""Man of the West,"" ""Voice in the Mirror,"" ""The George Raft Story"" and ""The Third Voice."" She composed the title song for ""Voice in the Mirror."" In 1972, she began her role in ""Emergency!"" After the show ended in 1977, she did one last film before retiring from show business. She is survived by a daughter from her marriage to Mr. Webb, Lisa Breen of Manhattan Beach, Calif. She also left three children from her 39-year marriage to Mr. Troupe: a daughter, Kelly Ronick, and twin sons, Jody and Reese, all of Los Angeles. http://www.nytimes.com"
49642,"SIPPIE WALLACE, BLUES SINGER KNOWN AS 'TEXAS NIGHTINGALE'","Sippie Wallace, a major blues singer and songwriter of the 1920's, died Saturday at Sinai Hospital in Detroit.","Sippie Wallace, a major blues singer and songwriter of the 1920's, died Saturday at Sinai Hospital in Detroit. She was 88 years old. Mrs. Wallace, known as the ''Texas Nightingale,'' was one of the leading blues shouters of the 1920's - a contemporary of Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey - and she wrote such earthy, self-assertive blues songs as ''Women Be Wise'' and ''Mighty Tight Woman,'' songs that were embraced by feminists in the 1970's. She abandoned blues for gospel in the 1930's, but returned to secular music in the 1960's. During the 1970's, her songs were rediscovered by the singer Bonnie Raitt, who helped revive Mrs. Wallace's performing career. Sippie Wallace, whose original name was Beulah Thomas, was born on Nov. 1, 1898, in Houston, one of 13 children of a Baptist deacon. She was nicknamed Sippie in grammar school because, she once said, ''My teeth were so far apart and I had to sip everything.'' She learned to sing in church, but also heard the blues and ragtime in the tent shows that used to tour the South. In 1916, she joined one - dancing in the chorus line, acting in plays and comedy routines, singing and working as the snake charmer's assistant. Became Nationally Known In 1923 she moved to Chicago on the advice of her older brother, the pianist George W. Thomas. There, she started recording for Okeh records, and rapidly gained a national reputation; she recorded with such major musicians as Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. Through the 1920's and 1930's, she toured theaters and vaudeville houses around the United States, shouting the blues without a microphone. She also married Matt Wallace, a gambler. But in the late 1930's, after the death of her husband and her brother, she settled in Detroit and returned to singing gospel music. Another Texas blues singer, Victoria Spivey, persuaded her to return to blues singing in the mid-1960's, and in 1971 Bonnie Raitt's debut album included two Wallace songs. Ms. Raitt toured and recorded with Mrs. Wallace during the 1970's and 1980's; in 1983, Mrs. Wallace's Atlantic album, ''Sippie,'' was nominated for a Grammy Award. Mrs. Wallace is survived by a granddaughter."

Pomerantz, a lawyer who pioneered shareholder suits against major corporations and for a time directed the prosecution of German industrialists after World War II, died yesterday in New York City. He was 79 years old and lived in New York. Mr. Pomerantz, the founder of the law firm of Pomerantz Levy Haudek & Block, was a man of extraordinary contrasts. He championed the virtues of Socialism and the rights of the poor while commanding large legal fees. He defended a Soviet diplomat accused of spying at the height of the cold war, and also represented some of the largest corporations in America. Mr. Pomerantz, who was often described as looking a bit like a giant panda bear, was an articulate courtroom orator who reveled in fencing with his political and legal adversaries. ''I love the buck,'' he said once. ''I'm for it. I'm out to make it. But with the money I've made I haven't forgotten that it's a hard, cruel world, and when it's a question of the rich against the poor, I'm for the poor.'' Law School at Night Born in Brooklyn in 1903, Mr. Pomerantz worked his way through Brooklyn Law School at night. In 1924 he got his first job as a lawyer, for $4 a week in Manhattan. His first foray into what became known as shareholders' derivative suits came in 1933. A shareholder's derivative suit is similar to a class-action suit in that it represents grievances of a group, and members of the group share any award. In the derivative suit, however, the award is made to a company and shareholders benefit indirectly. In class-action suits, the award goes directly to those who have brought the suit. In the 1933 case, a woman who owned 20 shares of the National City Bank of New York, which had dropped from $585 to $17 a share after the stock market crash of 1929, called Mr. Pomerantz to see if she could sue. When he discovered that the principal officers of the bank had set aside a considerable percentage of the bank's profits as incentive bonuses, he took the case. Mr. Pomerantz won and devoted himself to defending the rights of minority shareholders. Active in Politics Mr. Pomerantz was active in Democratic politics in the late 1940's, running unsuccessfully for the Supreme Court in New York in 1945. But he broke with the party to work as the campaign treasurer for Henry Wallace in his race for President against Harry S. Truman in 1948. In 1946, he was sent to Germany to lead the prosecution of German industrialists for collaborating in Nazi war crimes. Eight months later, he left Germany after accusing the Truman Administration of not really wanting to pursue the trials. In one of the era's most celebrated espionage cases, he defended Valentin A. Gubitchev, a Soviet diplomat accused of having conspired with Judith Coplon, a Department of Justice analyst, to funnel defense secrets to the Soviet Union. Both were convicted in 1950 and received 15-year prison terms, but Mr. Gubitchev's sentence was stayed when he agreed to leave the country. Miss Coplon was freed on bail and 16 years later the indictment was dropped by the Justice Department. Mr. Pomerantz is survived by his wife, Phyllis; a son, Daniel, of Massachusetts, and a daughter, Charlotte, of Manhattan."
40306,"Joseph Heitz, 81, a Standout In California Winemaking","Joseph Heitz, who made one of America's most famous wines and helped put the Napa Valley of California on the map as a source of fine wines made from bordeaux grapes, died there last Saturday at a hospital in the town of St. Helena.","Joseph Heitz, who made one of America's most famous wines and helped put the Napa Valley of California on the map as a source of fine wines made from bordeaux grapes, died there last Saturday at a hospital in the town of St. Helena. He was 81. The cause of death was not disclosed, but he had had several debilitating strokes in recent years. Joe Heitz -- no one ever called him anything but Joe -- was the founder and president of Heitz Cellars, at St. Helena. Over the years he produced a variety of wines, but his reputation was based almost entirely on just one of them: his Martha's Vineyard cabernet sauvignon, named not for the island off Massachusetts but for the vineyard that supplied him the grapes. That vineyard, in nearby Oakville, is owned by Tom and Martha May and is named for Mrs. May. For more than two decades, Heitz Martha's Vineyard was the benchmark by which California cabernets were judged. A wine of astonishing depth and staying power, some of its earliest vintages, including 1966, the first, are still delicious. In his 1989 book, ""California's Great Cabernets,"" James Laube rated Martha's Vineyard the best of all of them from 1966 through 1970 and in 1974, and among the top three in 1973, 1975, 1979 and 1985. Some connoisseurs call the 1974 Martha's Vineyard one of the finest cabernets ever made in California. Mr. Heitz was born on a farm in Princeton, Ill., some 100 miles west of Chicago, and joined the Army Air Corps after two years at a junior college. For most of World War II, he served as a mechanic at an Air Corps base near Fresno, Calif. On his days off, he later recalled, he knocked on doors looking for part-time work ""to pick up beer money."" One of those doors was at the Italian Swiss Colony winery, which hired him and set him on his career path. After the war, he enrolled at the University of California at Davis and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in winemaking. He worked for E. & J. Gallo in Modesto for a time, then in 1951 went to Beaulieu Vineyards in the Napa Valley as an assistant winemaker, for $325 a month. He stayed at Beaulieu almost 10 years, working for the legendary Andre Tchelistcheff. Then, in 1961, after four years teaching enology at Fresno State University, he decided to go into business for himself. He found a small vineyard just south of St. Helena planted entirely with grignolino, an obscure Italian grape. Scraping up about $5,000, he bought the eight-acre tract and set out to support his family on the $4,500 a year he was told the place would earn. His first break came in 1963, when he bought several barrels of wine from Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma, which was shutting down temporarily. Blending the wines in his own cellar, he produced some exceptional chardonnay and some respectable cabernet sauvignon. His reputation began to grow. In 1965, he bought his first cabernet grapes from the Mays. He blended them into his regular cabernet that year, but the result was so good that in 1966 he vinified the Mays' grapes separately. That was the beginning of a California legend. The Mays' vineyard, like almost all vineyards in the Napa Valley, was devastated in the early 1990's by phylloxera -- small insects that attack plant roots -- and subsequently replanted. No Martha's Vineyard cabernet has been released since 1992. In the mid-1960's, Mr. Heitz moved his home and winery across the Napa Valley to an almost hidden spot off the Silverado Trail known as Spring Valley. He expanded over the years, eventually owning 350 acres of grapes. But he never owned any of Martha's Vineyard or of Bella Oaks Vineyard, the source of his second cabernet, a wine that some connoisseurs have preferred to the Martha's Vineyard. Mr. Heitz was not given to the laid-back California style or the heavy social schedule of many of his neighbors. Tall, intense and with some irascible, he detested the small talk of wine dilettantes and would often subject guests, particularly journalists, to an informal tasting before submitting to questions. But while he was a private person in a gregarious world, he helped more than a few wine newcomers get started in the Napa Valley. Mr. Heitz's son David began to take on winemaking responsibilities in the late 1970's and is currently the Heitz Cellars winemaker. A daughter, Kathleen Heitz Myers, is now president. Also surviving are Mr. Heitz's wife, Alice, and another son, Rollie. ""Joe transcended the narrow view of winemaking that prevailed in the 60's,"" said his friend Warren Winiarski, founder of another Napa Valley winery, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars. ""Joe looked at wine as an outsider. When he pushed his price to $9 a bottle, people said, 'This is madness.' But he persisted. He asked, 'Would an artist base his price on the cost of the paint and brushes?' In the Napa Valley, he was the first artisan."" http://www.nytimes.com"

Mr. Zack retired in January 1980 as director of public relations for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, a post he had held since 1967. His retirement coincided with the death of Mr. Meany, who helped merge the two national labor groups into a 15 million-member federation in 1955 and served as the federation's only president until November 1979. Mr. Zack, a native of Massachusetts, had lived in Florida since his retirement. He became head of the merged labor organization's public relations staff after serving as assistant public relations director of the Congress of Industrial Organizations from 1952 until the merger with the American Federation of Labor three years later. He was the Ohio C.I.O. publicity director from 1947 to 1952. Mr. Zack, a longtime member of the Newspaper Guild, played a major role in the 1946-47 guild strike against newspapers in Springfield, Mass. He is survived by his wife, Jane, and two children, Linda Tarr-Whelan, director of government relations for the National Education Associaton, and Allen, former assistant director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. public relations staff and now a member of a Washington public relations concern."
37191,"Millicent Fenwick, 82, Dies; Gave Character to Congress","Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.","Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old. She died of heart failure, her family said. ""Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics,"" said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. ""With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."" Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts. She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's ""Doonesbury"" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment. Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights. Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman. She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks ""if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet."" Hail and Farewell and Oink Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries. In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: ""I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good."" Her reply was classic Fenwick: ""That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."" When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: ""We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."" Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor. Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money. After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987. After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery. Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge. Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish. As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own. She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest. She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled ""Vogue's Book of Etiquette"" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies. Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren."

He was 88. The cause was complications from diabetes, said his wife, Dana Scarpitta. Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Scarpitta grew up in Los Angeles, where his father, an Italian-born sculptor, created the exterior bas-reliefs on the Los Angeles Stock Exchange building and his Russian-born mother briefly acted. After graduating from Hollywood High School, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rome. During World War II he joined the United States Navy, where he was a ''monuments man,'' part of a multinational group charged with searching out, cataloging and rescuing art from the Nazis, as well as identifying monuments and historical sites to protect from Allied bombings. After the war Mr. Scarpitta continued making art in Rome until 1958, when the dealer Leo Castelli lured him to New York with the promise of an exhibition and financial assistance. The following January Mr. Castelli unveiled a series of Mr. Scarpitta's wrapped, or ''bandaged,'' canvases in a show titled ''Extramurals.'' At once macho and tender, the mostly monochromatic works were bound in webbing and canvas he had found at Army surplus stores, often with an opening in them not unlike that of a birthing gown -- a symbol, Mr. Scarpitta said, of man's potential for spiritual renewal. The automobile culture of his California childhood fueled his lifelong fascination with movement, or lack thereof. In the mid-1960s he created a series of racing cars, among them the ''Rajo Jack Special,'' a reproduction of the car driven by one of the country's first African-American racecar drivers, and ''Lynx,'' a full-size, fully operational World War II armored car. But Mr. Scarpitta wasn't content merely to fashion speedsters. He raced them as part of a team at a dirt track near his second home in New Oxford, Pa., the name of his crew sponsor -- the Leo Castelli Gallery -- emblazoned on the side of his own car, No. 59. In the 1970s Mr. Scarpitta began constructing sleds, which resembled nothing so much as slow-motion archaeological artifacts, from discarded objects -- chairs, hockey sticks, Christmas trees -- he scavenged from trash bins around the city. ''I wrapped my sleds,'' he said in an interview with James Harithas, founding director of the Station Museum of Contemporary Art in Houston. ''It was just natural. They had their own kind of skin.'' He added, ''It was like wanting to give it a breathing capability of its own that could come out of the matter it was made of.'' The painter Willem de Kooning bought Mr. Scarpitta's first sled. In addition to his wife, Mr. Scarpitta is survived by two daughters, Lola Knapple of Los Angeles and Stella Cartaino of the Bronx; five grandsons; two great-grandchildren; and a sister, Carmen Scarpitta of Rome."
35222,"Art Donovan, a Behemoth Of Modesty, Dies at 89","Art Donovan, a 300-pound tackle for the Baltimore Colts whose nimble brutality helped propel him to the Hall of Fame and his team to two championships in the 1950s, and whose humor-laced tales about himself and the game won him an equal helping of celebrity, died on Sunday in Baltimore.","Art Donovan, a 300-pound tackle for the Baltimore Colts whose nimble brutality helped propel him to the Hall of Fame and his team to two championships in the 1950s, and whose humor-laced tales about himself and the game won him an equal helping of celebrity, died on Sunday in Baltimore. He was 89. The Baltimore Ravens, the city's current football team, announced the death. Donovan was an All-Pro defensive tackle, played in five Pro Bowls and in 1968 became the first Colt and the first pure defensive lineman inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. A 12-year National Football League veteran, he was one of the Colts' ''Magnificent Seven,'' led by quarterback Johnny Unitas, who together helped make the 1958 league championship showdown against the Giants at Yankee Stadium the greatest game ever played, in the opinion of many football historians. The Colts won the game, 23-17, on a Unitas-led drive in the league's first sudden-death overtime championship game. A national television audience of 40 million watched the game as it spilled into the night. Suddenly, baseball was no longer America's indisputable national sport. Other members of the Magnificent Seven may have been better known than Donovan: Unitas, Lenny Moore, Raymond Berry, Jim Parker, Gino Marchetti and Coach Weeb Ewbank. But Donovan's smack-down belligerence, coupled with astounding agility for a 6-foot-3, 300-pound behemoth, was at the center of the Colts' effort. Donovan made a key tackle to help set up their final drive. But always self-deprecating, he volunteered in his autobiography that at another point in the game, he had ended up flat on his back. Donovan practically made a second career of talking, and joking, about his weight and his battles to reduce it, gamely using his nickname in the title of his autobiography, ''Fatso: Football When Men Were Really Men'' (1987). In the book, he wrote that he was a light eater. ''I never started eating until it was light,'' he said. He barely hid his distaste for calisthenics: he said he did 13 push-ups in 13 years of training camps. Donovan became a darling of late-night talk shows. Promoting his book on ''Late Night with David Letterman,'' he confessed that he had not exactly read it but knew most of the stories. Mr. Letterman asked if he would recommend it. ''I don't know, I guess so,'' Donovan responded. Despite his modesty, his peers were quick to praise him. He was in the sixth class admitted to the Hall of Fame, vaulting over a backlog of players going back to the 1920s waiting to get in. One opponent, Stan Jones, a Chicago Bears lineman, likened his agility to a matador's. Ewbank said nobody could fool Donovan twice with the same play. Buzz Nutter, a Colts center who played with him, said, ''One man alone could not knock Artie off his feet.'' Donovan came from a blue-collar era of football, played, he said, by ''oversized coal miners and West Texas psychopaths.'' He wondered how today's players deal with continual meetings and films and dietitians -- all of which he experienced as little as possible. He thought hot dogs and cheeseburgers and full-contact practices twice a day were good enough. He played much of his career without a face mask, prompting a writer to observe that he had more stitches than a football. Donovan spoke warmly of the time Norm Van Brocklin, a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams and the Philadelphia Eagles, was tired of his pass rush and threw a bullet pass right into his unprotected face. ''I couldn't believe he'd just waste a play like that,'' Donovan wrote. ''I guess he was mad. You have to respect a guy like that.'' Arthur James Donovan Jr. was born, weighing 17 pounds, on June 5, 1924, in the Bronx. His grandfather, Mike Donovan, was a world middleweight champion and taught boxing to Theodore Roosevelt. His father, Arthur Sr., was a boxing referee who officiated at 14 heavyweight title bouts, most involving Joe Louis. Both father and grandfather are in the Boxing Hall of Fame. Art Donovan Jr. attended Notre Dame for a year before enlisting in the Marines and fighting in the South Pacific. He was the first professional football player to be admitted to the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame. After his discharge, he was a standout player at Boston College, where he earned a bachelor's degree. The Giants, his favorite team, tried to draft him as a junior and even sent him money, but he remained in college and was drafted by the Colts in 1950, signing a contract for $4,500. He was 26, having delayed his career for military service. The Colts franchise at the time was dissolved in 1951, and Donovan was picked up by the Cleveland Browns before being injured in a scrimmage. He was soon traded to the New York Yankees football club, which moved to Dallas and became the Texans in 1952. A year later, the franchise moved to Baltimore as a new version of the Colts. In 1959, the Colts reprised their 1958 title victory over the Giants by defeating them again for the championship. He retired from football in 1962 after the Colts cut him from the squad a few weeks into training camp. His top salary in the game was $22,000. He later owned liquor stores and the Valley Country Club in Baltimore and was a popular sports commentator on local radio. Mike Preston, a columnist for The Baltimore Sun, wrote of Donovan on Monday, ''He drank Schlitz beer and burped on the airwaves.'' Donovan is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Schaech; his daughters Kelly Donovan-Mazzulli, Debbie Donovan Smith, Christine Donovan and Mary Donovan O'Hern; his son, Arthur III; his sister, Joan Elizabeth Donovan; and seven grandchildren. ''Take me for what I am,'' Donovan once said. ''I'm a nobody, like you or anyone else. I was lucky enough to play football, and everyone liked me. That's it.''"

Arnon, who added significantly to the understanding of plant photosynthesis, died on Tuesday in Berkeley, Calif.","Daniel I. Arnon, who added significantly to the understanding of plant photosynthesis, died on Tuesday in Berkeley, Calif. He was 84 and lived in nearby Kensington. The cause was complications after cardiac arrest, said the University of California at Berkeley, where Dr. Arnon retired in 1978 as professor of cell physiology. In 1973 Dr. Arnon won the National Medal of Science for ""his fundamental research into the mechanism of green plant utilization of light to produce chemical energy and oxygen and for contributions to our understanding of plant nutrition."" A major contribution was his role in explaining the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, the ""energy messenger"" within living cells. In photosynthesis, such synthesis consists of using light energy to hitch an additional phosphate group (formed of phosphorus, hydrogen and oxygen) to adenosine diphosphate to form energy-rich ATP. The process is a key element of photosynthesis, upon which most life on earth is directly or indirectly dependent. In 1954 he and his colleagues were able for the first time to perform this process in the laboratory, rather than in living tissue. Dr. Melvin Calvin, a Berkeley colleague, who won a Nobel Prize in 1961 for his own pioneering research into photosynthesis, said Dr. Arnon made a ""significant contribution"" to deciphering its complex chemistry. Daniel Israel Arnon was born in Warsaw in 1910. He read the works of Jack London and decided on a career in California agriculture. As a teen-ager, he came to New York and was accepted by the University of California. His undergraduate and graduate education were at that university, where in 1936 he obtained his doctorate in plant physiology. His earliest research focused on plant nutrition, such as testing the relative efficiency of raising plants in soil, rather than afloat in nutrient-rich water. From 1943 to 1946, as a major in the United States Army, he used his expertise to feed troops stationed on barren Ponape Island in the western Pacific by growing crops in gravel and nutrient-rich water. His work on photosynthesis began in the late 1940's and focused on chloroplasts, the structures within cells that perform this function. He and his colleagues were able to extract chloroplasts from spinach and study their function in the laboratory. From 1952 to 1953 he was president of the American Society of Plant Physiologists. He also won awards in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden, as well as the United States. In 1940 he married Lucile Soule, who died in 1986. He is survived by two sons, Dr. Stephen Arnon of Orinda, Calif., and Dr. Dennis Arnon of San Francisco; three daughters, Anne A. Hodge of Arrowgate, England, Dr. Ruth Hanham of Lancaster, England, and Nancy A. Agnew of Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren."

He was 62 and lived in Vida, Ore. Willie Nelson, Joan Baez, Don Gibson and B. B. King all recorded Mr. Newbury's songs. His most recognizable was ""Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition Was In),"" a psychedelic pop song that was a No. 5 hit for Kenny Rogers and the First Edition in 1968. He also wrote ""Funny, Familiar, Forgotten Feelings"" (recorded by Mr. Gibson), ""Sunshine"" (recorded by Ray Charles), ""Here Comes the Rain, Baby"" (recorded by Eddy Arnold) and ""She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye"" (recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis). Mr. Newbury himself recorded for several labels during his career, most successfully for Elektra. His 1971 ""Frisco Mabel Joy"" album included ""An American Trilogy,"" an innovative arrangement of ""Dixie,"" ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and ""All My Trials"" that became a staple at Presley's concerts. His 1988 album, ""In a New Age,"" revisited old material, and his 1994 live album, ""Nights When I Am Sane,"" was a mixture of old and new.

He was 85. His death was confirmed by his agent, Mandy Ward, who did not specify a cause or say where he died. Mr. Corbett, who stood just over five feet tall, delivered a gentle brand of comedy that appealed to a vast audience. He specialized in clever wordplay, self-deprecation (he titled his autobiography ''High Hopes'') and the effortless delivery of one-liners. A few examples: ''All those who believe in psychokinesis, raise my right hand.'' ''A cement mixer collided with a prison van on the Kingston bypass. Motorists are asked to be on the lookout for 16 hardened criminals.'' ''We've just heard that in the English Channel, a ship carrying red paint has collided with a ship carrying purple paint. It is believed that both crews have been marooned.'' Mr. Corbett began working with Mr. Barker in 1966 on ''The Frost Report,'' David Frost's short-lived British satirical show, which also featured future stars of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus,'' including John Cleese, who wrote on Twitter on Thursday that Mr. Corbett ''had the best timing I've ever watched.'' Mr. Corbett and Mr. Barker quickly developed an onscreen rapport. On ''The Two Ronnies,'' which aired from 1971 until 1987, the pair performed sketches, delivered mock headlines and sang. A seated Mr. Corbett often delivered a seemingly straightforward joke that meandered into a digressive monologue. In one of their most enduring sketches, titled ''Fork Handles'' or ''Four Candles'' depending on one's interpretation, Mr. Corbett plays a shopkeeper who becomes exasperated as he misinterprets a list of items that Mr. Barker asks him to fetch. ''The Two Ronnies'' attracted more than 20 million viewers at its peak in Britain and was broadcast abroad to great popularity, including on many PBS stations in the United States. The series ended after Mr. Barker retired, though the two reunited for occasional specials. Mr. Barker died in 2005. The show has continued to be seen in reruns, and the duo's routines are familiar to audiences decades after it went off the air. Prime Minister David Cameron praised Mr. Corbett's abiding appeal on Thursday, writing on Twitter that he ''had the rare talent of making all generations laugh.'' In recent years, a number of contemporary British comedians irreverently cast Mr. Corbett against type. In a 2006 episode of Ricky Gervais's HBO series ''Extras,'' Mr. Corbett, playing himself, was caught snorting cocaine in a bathroom stall. Ronald Balfour Corbett was born on Dec. 4, 1930, in Edinburgh. He served in the Royal Air Force, where he was reportedly the shortest commissioned officer in the British forces. He moved to London in the early 1950s to pursue acting and also worked as a bartender. He first met Mr. Barker when he served him a drink. Mr. Barker later joked that Mr. Corbett had stood on two boxes to reach over the bar. Mr. Corbett wooed the actress and dancer Anne Hart in the same bar. They married in the mid-1960s. She survives him, as do their daughters, Emma and Sophie Corbett, and four grandchildren. He and his wife lived in Surrey."

He was 80 years old. Mr. Kullman was one of the first American singers to establish a career in Europe before returning to his home country in triumph. His successes in Berlin, Vienna, Salzburg and London, and his work with such conductors as Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter and Arturo Toscanini made it possible for him to join the Metropolitan, where he sang a remarkably varied repertory in 402 performances - 283 in New York, 119 on tour - between 1935 and 1960. Although never one of the greatest opera stars - in part because his international career was hindered in its prime by World War II - Mr. Kullman was a deeply respected artist. ''Mr. Kullman's Walther is admirably conceived, sung with true and warm feeling, with stage business that is wholly in the picture,'' wrote Olin Downes, the music critic of The New York Times, about his performance in Wagner's ''Meistersinger,'' in a typical review. Studied at Juilliard Mr. Kullman was born in New Haven of German parentage on Jan. 13, 1903; the family name was spelled both ''Kullman'' and ''Kullmann'' well into his career. He was a choirboy in his youth and a member of the Yale Glee Club at college. He studied for three years at the Juilliard School of Music in New York and at the American Conservatory in Paris on a scholarship, and he taught at Smith College for a year. But in the late 20's there was hardly any domestic circuit for young American singers. Mr. Kullman did tour for a season with Vladimir Rosing's pioneering, English-language American Opera Company, but realized that his best hope for success was to establish a European career. Mr. Kullman auditioned in Berlin for Klemperer, who at that time was director of the Kroll Opera, the experimental wing of the Berlin State Opera. He made his debut with the Kroll as Pinkerton in Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' on Feb. 24, 1931. The Kroll Opera shut down at the end of that season, but Mr. Kullman was taken on by the State Opera proper, where he sang until 1936. His tenure in Berlin was cut short by his defiance of a Nazi ban on German-based singers appearing at the Salzburg Festival in Austria, where Toscanini and Walter were attempting to establish an anti-Fascist counterweight to the German summer festivals. Sang Regularly in Vienna Mr. Kullman, who was now singing regularly in Vienna, as well, performed often with those conductors, including Walter's first recording of Mahler's ''Das Lied von der Erde'' and Toscanini's famous productions of Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' and Verdi's ''Falstaff'' at Salzburg. Mr. Kullman's Met debut took place on Dec. 20, 1935, in the title role of Gounod's ''Faust'' - with 1,765 fans from New Haven present to cheer him on. ''Mr. Kullman made an effective debut, if not a sensational one,'' wrote Howard Taubman in The Times. ''His voice is a lyric tenor of equal range and agreeable texture, and he employs it to admirable purpose. There was a sense of style, musicianship and authority in his work.'' At the Met, Mr. Kullman's repertory included 33 parts, ranging from Mozart, to mainstream Italian tenor roles, to French operas, to the lighter Wagner. His most frequently sung role was Eisenstein in ''Die Fledermaus,'' which he performed 30 times. In addition, he made an occasional film and appeared on nationwide radio broadcasts. Last Met Performance In 1956 he accepted a teaching position at Indiana University in Bloomington, but continued to sing at the Met. By this time his roles were mostly smaller, secondary parts, such as Goro in ''Madama Butterfly,'' Valzacchi in ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and Shuisky in ''Boris Godunov.'' It was in this last part that he appeared at the Met for the final time, on Dec. 3, 1960. Mr. Kullman is survived by his daughter, Elise Burke, and a granddaughter, Yvonne Coty."
28779,Cecil Brown Is Dead; A News Broadcaster And Correspondent,"Cecil Brown, a radio news broadcaster whose career was studded with drama and controversy, died of a ruptured aorta Sunday at the Medical Center at the University of California at Los Angeless.","Cecil Brown, a radio news broadcaster whose career was studded with drama and controversy, died of a ruptured aorta Sunday at the Medical Center at the University of California at Los Angeless. He was 80 years old. Mr. Brown, a prize-winning journalist, was expelled from Italy in 1941 by the government of Benito Mussolini for ''continued hostile attitude'' toward the regime while serving as a correspondent for CBS. In December 1941, Mr. Brown was aboard the British battle cruiser Repulse when she and the battleship Prince of Wales were sunk by the Japanese off Malaya. After being rescued by a destroyer, he broadcast an eyewitness account of the sinking. His subsequent broadcasts from Singapore, however, brought him into conflict over censorship by the British authorities, who called his accounts detrimental to public morale and barred him from further broadcasting. He quit CBS in 1943 after a controversy with network officials. Mr. Brown, who was born in New Brighton, Pa., was graduated in 1929 from Western Reserve and Ohio State University.

31023,Alphonse Nkubito Dies at 42; Ex-Rwandan Justice Minister,"Alphonse Marie Nkubito, a former Justice Minister of Rwanda and an outspoken voice for human rights and the rule of law, died on Feb. 13 at his home in the capital city of Kigali.","Alphonse Marie Nkubito, a former Justice Minister of Rwanda and an outspoken voice for human rights and the rule of law, died on Feb. 13 at his home in the capital city of Kigali. He was 42. According reports from Rwanda radio, Mr. Nkubito, the founding president of the Rwandan Association for the Defense of Human Rights, died of unspecified natural causes. Mr. Nkubito, who had survived two assassination attempts, began the process of rebuilding Rwanda's shattered justice system after four months of genocidal slaughter in 1994. For Mr. Nkubito, a moderate Hutu who served as Justice Minister under the insurgent Tutsi Government from July 1994 to August 1995, the task of prosecuting more than 50,000 Hutu militants accused of killing as many as one million of the minority Tutsi was an opportunity as well as a challenge. He saw it as a chance to use the ideals of law and justice to bridge the country's ethnic hatreds and break the cycle of rampage and revenge that had plagued Rwanda since he was a child. Born into a Hutu peasant family in 1954 in the waning days of an ancient Tutsi monarchy that had ruled under Belgian supervision since 1916, Mr. Nkubito was 5 years old when a Hutu uprising killed tens of thousands of Tutsi and drove half the Tutsi population into exile, primarily in neighboring Uganda. There, as Hutu in Rwanda consolidated their power under the dictatorship of Maj. Gen. Juvenal Habyarimana, the Tutsi, whose cattle-raising ancestors had subjugated the pastoral Hutu centuries earlier, proceeded to build an army. Many of the well-drilled, well-equipped soldiers who began raiding Rwanda in 1990 and conquered the country in 1994 were the children of the exiles of the 1950's. A promising student in secondary school, Mr. Nkubito was admitted to the new University of Rwanda School of Law, graduating with its second class, in 1978, after submitting a prescient dissertation on ""Homicide and Its Repression in Rwanda."" Mr. Nkubito, who went to work for the Justice Ministry and rose to become chief prosecutor for the Court of Appeals in Kigali, became so uneasy with the routine abuses of justice he witnessed that in September 1990 he helped found the human rights defense association. The next month, when Rwanda was invaded by Tutsi exiles from Uganda, and the Government jailed without charge 10,000 suspected rebel sympathizers, Mr. Nkubito used his authority to free hundreds of them before the Government intervened and transferred him to a provincial court. Undaunted, Mr. Nkubito, whose action had made him a hero to some in Rwanda, toured the country preaching reconciliation while accusing the Government of corruption and of crippling the justice system. After General Habyarimana grudgingly accepted a constitution providing for a multiparty system in 1991, Mr. Nkubito returned to his post in Kigali. But as fighting between Government forces and the Rwandan Liberation Front ebbed and surged over the next two years, Mr. Nkubito became an increasing irritant, so much so that in November 1993 he was seriously wounded in a grenade attack on his car by what his supporters describe as a Government assassination squad. Five months later, when the death of General Habyarimana, whose plane was shot down under mysterious circumstances on April 6, 1994, set off a well-planned, highly coordinated attack on the Tutsi minority and others by the Rwandan military, Mr. Nkubito was tipped off that a death squad was on its way to kill him. He escaped once again, eventually making his way to Belgium. When he accepted the position as Justice Minister after the Tutsi takeover in July, Mr. Nkubito did not alter his stance. He repeatedly denounced Government abuses and insisted on a full measure of due process for the thousands of Hutu detainees, many of them jailed on the strength of unsubstantiated denunciations by personal enemies. His scrupulous approach was used against him in October 1995, when he was ousted, ostensibly for dragging his feet in bringing the accused to trial. According to his friends, he was actually removed because he had sharply objected during a raucous Cabinet meeting to Government-sanctioned killings. After his dismissal, Mr. Nkubito became a director of the Bank of Kigali, but devoted much of his energies to investigating human rights abuses. Mr. Nkubito's small house in Kigali was often crowded with visitors seeking his advice on personal problems. Friends recalled that he paid no heed to those who urged him to leave the country for his own safety. He recently told a friend that he never went to bed at night expecting to see the day and never got up in the morning expecting to live to nightfall. Mr. Nkubito was found dead in his bed by a member of his household staff. He was overweight and suffered from hypertension and diabetes. Mr. Nkubito, whose wife and their three children died of illnesses several years ago, is survived by a son, Theophili, from a previous relationship."

Neuringer, a senior scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose research enhanced the medical applications of magnetic imaging technology, died Tuesday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 65 and lived in Wellesley, Mass. The cause was cancer, M.I.T. said. He retired there last month after 30 years as a staff member of the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory. Dr. Neuringer's work with M.R.I. -- the magnetic resonance imaging that creates cross-section snapshots of bodily organs -- found new ways to study the structure and functions of molecules and cells. Technology developed by him is used in cardiac surgery and in treating brain disease, diabetes and cancer. M.R.I.'s provide detailed ""pictures"" that show soft tissue not seen on X-rays. Although Dr. Neuringer was not a faculty member, he was known for inspiring the students who came in touch with him, many of them from Harvard Medical School, the Harvard-M.I.T. Division of Health Sciences and the M.I.T. Department of Nuclear Engineering. ""There are people in almost all basic magnetic resonance-imaging fields who at one time or another worked with him,"" said Dr. David Holtzman, a neurologist at Children's Hospital and visiting scientist at the Magnet Laboratory. Leo Neuringer was born in Manhattan, graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1957. He founded the Magnet Laboratory's High Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Resource in 1974 and its Magnetic Resonance Imaging Facility in 1982, serving as director of both until four years ago. Before his retirement in April, he directed an effort to develop instrumentation for the whole-body imaging of patients. Dr. Neuringer is survived by his wife, the former Adele Friedman; a son, Larry of Rye, N.Y.; two daughters, Dr. Julia Neuringer-Cohen and Dr. Isabel Neuringer, both of Brookline, Mass.; a sister, Frances Yarmush of Brooklyn; a brother, Irv, of Bethlehem, N.H., and one grandson."

29611,"Marvin Mandel, 95, Former Governor of Maryland","Former Gov. Marvin Mandel, whose record of modernizing Maryland's state government was overshadowed by a messy divorce and a fraud conviction for helping associates profit from a racetrack deal, died on Sunday in St. Mary's County, Md.","Former Gov. Marvin Mandel, whose record of modernizing Maryland's state government was overshadowed by a messy divorce and a fraud conviction for helping associates profit from a racetrack deal, died on Sunday in St. Mary's County, Md. He was 95. Gov. Larry Hogan, who confirmed the death, ordered that flags throughout the state be flown at half-staff. The cause of death was not given. Mr. Mandel, a Democrat, was first elected governor by the state legislature, where he was speaker of the House of Delegates, when Spiro T. Agnew, a Republican, resigned to become vice president in 1969 under President Richard M. Nixon. Voters elected Mr. Mandel in 1970 and again in 1974. Before he was indicted, in 1975, Mr. Mandel had compiled a substantial record as governor, including placing strict limits on carrying handguns, protecting the environment, streamlining the court system, helping Washington and Baltimore build subways, and having the state assume school construction costs that were burdening localities. In an interview for this obituary in 2011, he said he was proudest of his reorganization of the state government, in which 248 independent agencies were consolidated into 12 cabinet-level departments. ''We reduced the government to a sizable figure of agencies where we could adequately work with them,'' he said. ''You have no idea how difficult it was to get them to surrender their 'freedom,' as they called it.'' He added, ''I had legislators crawling out of my pocket.'' In his first two legislative sessions, 93 of the 95 measures he proposed were enacted. But it was a later legislative episode that brought him down and sent him to prison for 19 months before President Ronald Reagan commuted his sentence in 1981. In 1971, the owners of Marlboro, a decrepit half-mile racetrack, won approval from the legislature to double its allotment of racing days to 36 from 18. But Mr. Mandel vetoed the bill. The veto depressed Marlboro's value, and several of Mr. Mandel's close friends began buying stock in the track. In December, one of them, W. Dale Hess, a former state House majority leader, gave the governor a $320,000 share of a profitable investment company that owned land leased by the federal government for the Social Security Administration. Mr. Mandel also received real estate, jewelry and vacation trips, prosecutors said. Then, in January 1972, the legislature overrode Mr. Mandel's veto, with most of his allies there surprisingly voting to override. Marlboro, now with twice as many racing days as it previously had, suddenly became more valuable. Mr. Mandel insisted as late as 1975 that he had not known that his friends were investors. His conviction -- by the same federal prosecutors who had pursued Mr. Agnew on bribetaking charges, forcing him to resign as vice president in 1973 -- was not universally popular in Maryland. Some of Mr. Mandel's defenders said his actions on the racetrack had not been criminal but simply a matter of traditional state political practice. His conviction and three-year prison sentence were ultimately set aside by a federal court in 1987. That decision did not bear on what the jury had found; rather, it turned on a Supreme Court decision concluding that denying Marylanders the ''intangible'' benefit of honest government -- as the charges had read -- did not constitute a crime under the federal fraud statute. Congress promptly amended the statute to cover such an offense, but Mr. Mandel's conviction had been wiped away, and he got his law license back. He practiced business law in Baltimore and Annapolis, did some lobbying, served on the board of the University of Maryland and advised Robert Ehrlich, a Republican who served as governor from 2003 to 2007. Mr. Mandel insisted that he had done nothing wrong. In a 2010 memoir, ''I'll Never Forget It: Memoirs of a Political Accident From East Baltimore,'' he wrote, ''I said then, and I say now, that I never did anything illegal as governor of Maryland.'' Bradford Jacobs, an editor of The Baltimore Evening Sun, offered a broader appraisal in a 1984 book, ''Thimbleriggers'' (that word describes operators of a shell game played with thimbles). ''He played legislators as one would keys on a piano,'' Mr. Jacobs wrote, after praising Mr. Mandel for keeping ''the state budget commendably tight'' while enacting a progressive, modernizing agenda. ''He was excellent at legislating, competent at administering, and an embarrassment at acknowledging the difference, publicly perceived, between right and wrong.'' Mr. Mandel was born in Baltimore on April 19, 1920, and grew up there. He served in the Army after graduating from the University of Maryland Law School in 1942. He was elected to the House of Delegates in 1952 and rose quickly, becoming chairman of the city's delegation and the ways and means committee before becoming speaker in 1963. The criminal case against him attracted special attention because it was intertwined with Mr. Mandel's divorce, an event that he and his wife both later called a ''soap opera.'' In July 1973 he issued a news release announcing that he was going to divorce Barbara Mandel, his wife of 32 years, and marry Jeanne Blackistone Dorsey. His statement implied that he had discussed the matter with his wife. Mrs. Mandel, known as Bootsie, responded by saying that ''Marvin has not discussed this with me'' and that ''the governor crawled out of my bed this morning.'' She added, ''He should see a psychiatrist.'' Of her successor in the governor's heart, she said, ''How can she be a first lady when she isn't a lady first?'' Mrs. Mandel refused to move out of the governor's mansion, causing the governor to stay in a hotel and then in an apartment. She agreed to leave in December after a divorce settlement of over $500,000 had been negotiated. But the governor, who married Mrs. Dorsey on the day his divorce became final in 1974, did not have that kind of money. As his trial and a lawsuit filed by Mrs. Mandel showed, much of the money was put up by Irvin Kovens, one of the others convicted in the mail fraud case. Mr. Mandel's second wife died in 2001. He is survived by a son, Gary, and a daughter, Ellen M. Maltz, from his first marriage; a stepdaughter, Helen Dorsey; three stepsons, Paul, Philip and John Dorsey; and four grandchildren.

Marzio, who as the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston for nearly 30 years elevated it to major-museum status through an ambitious program of physical expansion and a commitment to Latin American, Hispanic and Asian art, died on Thursday in Houston. He was 67. The cause was cancer, Mary Haus, a spokeswoman for the museum, said. Mr. Marzio became the director of the Houston museum in 1982, after serving as the director and chief executive of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. He proved to be a dynamic force, equally adept at raising money, attracting important donations and identifying new artistic territory for the museum to explore in its exhibitions and acquisitions. Under his leadership, the museum added a sculpture garden designed by Isamu Noguchi in 1986; a center devoted to European decorative arts on a four-and-a-half-acre estate donated by Harris Masterson III and his wife, Carroll Sterling Masterson, in 1991; and the Audrey Jones Beck Building, designed by Rafael Moneo, in 2000, to house much of its permanent collection. At his death, Mr. Marzio was planning a third building dedicated to arts movements in the Americas, Europe and Asia. The museum, which was founded in 1900, received several important donations while Mr. Marzio was director, notably Alfred C. Glassell Jr.'s collection of African, pre-Columbian and Indonesian gold; Ms. Beck's gift of 46 Impressionist and Postimpressionist paintings; and the oil heiress Caroline Wiess Law's bequest of more than $400 million and works by de Kooning, Picasso, Arshile Gorky and others. Mr. Marzio was intent on diversifying and expanding the museum's commitment to artists outside the European and North American mainstream. He created new departments of Asian and Latin American art and established a new research institution, the International Center for the Arts of the Americas. The broadening focus of the museum was reflected in pioneering exhibitions like ''Hispanic Art in the United States: 30 Contemporary Painters and Sculptors,'' which opened in 1987 and traveled to museums around the country, including the Brooklyn Museum in 1989. Although his name inevitably appeared on the short list of candidates when vacancies appeared at top museums in other cities, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Mr. Marzio stayed put in Houston. Under his leadership, the museum's attendance increased to 1.6 million visitors annually from 300,000; membership to more than 40,000 from 7,000; the operating budget to $52 million from $5 million; and the endowment to more than $1 billion from $25 million. The museum's permanent collection more than tripled in size, to 63,000 works from 20,000. Peter Cort Marzio was born on May 8, 1943, on Governors Island, off Manhattan. The first member of his working-class Italian family to finish high school, he won a football scholarship to Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pa., where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1965. After earning a doctorate in history at the University of Chicago in 1969, he taught at the University of Maryland and was a research assistant to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin on his book ''The Americans: The Democratic Experience,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1973. After serving as a curator of prints and chairman of the cultural history department at the Smithsonian Institution, Mr. Marzio was named the Corcoran director in 1978. From 1997 to 2000, he was chairman of the Federal Council on Arts and Humanities. He was married with two children, but the family declined to provide information about survivors. Mr. Marzio was the author of ''Rube Goldberg: His Life and Works'' (1973) and two standard works on the history of drawing and lithography in the United States: ''The Art Crusade: An Analysis of American Drawing Manuals, 1820-1860'' (1976), and ''The Democratic Art'' (1979)."
32674,"Kenneth Walton, 76, Bold F.B.I. Official","Kenneth Walton, a flamboyant official with the Federal Bureau of Investigation who galvanized the agency's New York office against violent political radicals and entrenched organized crime bosses in the early 1980s, died on May 25 in Albuquerque.","Kenneth Walton, a flamboyant official with the Federal Bureau of Investigation who galvanized the agency's New York office against violent political radicals and entrenched organized crime bosses in the early 1980s, died on May 25 in Albuquerque. He was 76. The cause was throat cancer, his wife, Charlotte, said. Mr. Walton emerged as the public face of the F.B.I. in notorious cases that included the 1981 robbery of a Brink's armored car in Rockland County, N.Y., the arrest in 1982 of a fugitive in Manhattan for extorting $1 million from Johnson & Johnson in the Tylenol poisoning scare and the government's offensive against the Mafia after Rudolph W. Giuliani became the federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Mr. Walton mixed the panache of a central-casting G-man with an audacity to defy rigid protocol, a combination that defined him inside the F.B.I. as an ''agent's agent'' and allowed for unusual joint operations between the bureau and its frequent rival, the New York Police Department. ''Ken Walton was the operational reason it succeeded,'' Robert J. McGuire, a former New York City police commissioner, said in an interview this week. ''He had the complete trust and confidence of the cops because he was more of a street detective than a button-down bureau agent.'' The joint task forces established in New York became models for cooperation between the F.B.I. and local law enforcement agencies across the country. Mr. Walton's style as the bureau's deputy assistant director in New York -- a title he held for six years as second in command of the nation's largest F.B.I. office -- sometimes rankled his superiors in Washington. When Lee F. Laster retired as chief of the New York office in 1985, Mr. Walton, instead of succeeding him, was shifted to be special agent in charge of the bureau's Detroit division. Once there, Mr. Walton successfully pursued corrupt judges and other officials, but he also clashed with the local federal prosecutor, Roy C. Hayes. He was transferred to Washington and promoted to deputy assistant director of the bureau's criminal division. According to Ronald Kessler's 1993 book, ''The FBI,'' Mr. Walton was asked to take a polygraph test during an inquiry into a news leak about a preliminary F.B.I. investigation into possible financial irregularities involving the office of Representative William H. Gray III, Democrat of Pennsylvania. The Justice Department responded to the leak by saying Mr. Gray was not a target and was cooperating with the investigation. Mr. Walton denied being the source of the leak, but bristled at being asked to take a lie-detector test and refused to do so. He retired from the F.B.I. in 1989, ending a 24-year career with it. He worked on other government inquiries, including a congressional investigation into counterfeiting that led to a redesign of the $100 bill. He moved to New Mexico in 1994 and opened a private investigation agency. Kenneth Paul Walton was born on July 26, 1939, in Bloomer, Wis., just north of Eau Claire. His father, also named Kenneth, was a bus driver. His mother was the former Alvina Schnese. After serving in the National Guard and the Air Force, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. In addition to his wife, the former Charlotte Rivera, he is survived by two sons, Paul and Grant; a daughter, Samantha Walton; three granddaughters; four great-grandchildren; and a brother, Jim. Mr. Walton became known as ''the Caped Crusader'' for his habit of flinging an overcoat over his shoulders as he bolted from his desk to the front lines. ''I've worked for people who have said, 'Keep me advised,''' he told The New York Times in 1981. ''I don't have to be kept advised, because very frequently I'm there.'' Mr. Walton, Mr. Kessler wrote, ''was someone who appreciated the fact that the work of the F.B.I. is, after all, done by the field, not by headquarters, someone who was willing to stand up to headquarters to support his agents.'' That camaraderie extended beyond the bureau. Joseph Valiquette, who was the F.B.I. spokesman in New York, recalled in an interview this week that outside his office Mr. Walton kept the kind of ceremonial green lantern that the police would hang at a crime scene to identify a command post. ''The cops loved that,'' Mr. Valiquette said. While seeking the suspect in the Tylenol case, Mr. Walton transferred counterintelligence agents without permission to flood Midtown Manhattan with wanted posters. Three weeks later, the suspect was arrested in a library on East 40th Street, where a patron recognized him from a poster. He pursued suspects aggressively in the armored car case, in which two Nyack police officers and a Brink's guard were killed. The robbery was carried out by a coalition of radical groups that included members of the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army. The crime, Mr. Walton told The Times in 1981, undercut much of the intellectual support that what he called ''the entire militant left movement'' had drawn in the 1970s, when its leaders were treated as heroes by some. He personally led a raid on a Mississippi farmhouse with armored trucks and SWAT teams to arrest a suspect in the Brink's case. (She was later released because she had not been at the crime scene.) Despite his many exploits in the field, Mr. Walton said that during his six years in New York he had fired his gun at a live target only once: He shot a rat in the corridor outside his office at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan."
32005,GERALD MOORE IS DEAD AT 87; TOP ACCOMPANIST FOR SINGERS,"Gerald Moore, an English pianist whose sensitive performances and articulate advocacy helped elevate accompaniment to a high level of musical endeavor, died in his sleep Friday at his home in Buckinghamshire, England.","Gerald Moore, an English pianist whose sensitive performances and articulate advocacy helped elevate accompaniment to a high level of musical endeavor, died in his sleep Friday at his home in Buckinghamshire, England. He was 87 years old. Mr. Moore, whose career spanned more than half a century, served as accompanist, on disk and in concert, to most of the major artists of his time. Although he appeared several times as a soloist in his youth and was a splendid interpreter of the duo-sonata literature, he made his most vivid impression in the song repertory, where his performances with Elena Gerhardt, Elisabeth Schumann, John McCormack and later with Victoria de los Angeles, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf were hailed as exemplary partnerships. ''Moore's strength lay not only in the vastness of his repertory,'' William S. Mann wrote in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ''nor even in the beauty of his legato playing, his subtle command of pedaling and his mastery of tone color, but more especially in his chameleonic empathy with every musical partner - whether Casals, Chaliapin or a young debutant recitalist - and his readiness to turn every partnership to musical advantage of a refreshing and inspiriting nature.'' Over the course of his career, Mr. Moore recorded virtually all of Hugo Wolf's lieder, most of the songs of Richard Strauss and more than 500 Schubert songs. In addition to the Austro-Germanic repertory, Mr. Moore was equally at home with the Spanish cancion (he often accompanied Miss de los Angeles in this music) and the French melodie (he made a memorable series of disks with Maggie Teyte). Recorded Farewell Recital Such was his reputation that the Grand Prix du Disque, usually reserved for outstanding soloists, was awarded to Mr. Moore on four occasions. When he retired from concertizing in 1967, his farewell recital - in which he was ''accompanied'' by Miss de los Angeles, Miss Schwarzkopf and Mr. Fischer-Dieskau - was recorded by EMI. Mr. Moore insisted that he was not a ''born'' accompanist. ''This old cliche is constantly applied to anybody in any walk of life and is, in my opinion, absolute nonsense,'' he wrote in a witty, anecdotal autobiography, ''Am I Too Loud?'' (1962). ''Surely it is just as fatuous to say that a man is a born diplomat, a born leader of men, or a born drunkard. It must be environment, training, experience which, creating the opportunity, make the man. The use he makes of all these determines whether he turns diplomat or rises to the dizzy heights of accompanying. I cultivated a taste for the art in the same way that an epicure cultivates a taste for good wine and cigars.'' Gerald Moore was born in Watford, England, on July 30, 1899, and took his first piano lesson at the age of 6, at the insistence of his mother. ''It seems to me that as soon as I could toddle I was seized and flung, literally, at the piano,'' he recalled. When he was 13, the family moved to Canada and it was there, some three years later, that Mr. Moore began his career, accompanying a cellist and a tenor on a tour through several provinces. He was paid $40 for the entire trip, which he later estimated came out to about $1 a concert. In 1919, Mr. Moore returned to England to study. His early teachers included Wallis Bandey, Michael Hambourg and Mark Hambourg, but he considered the tenor John Coates, with whom he began working in 1925, to be the man who taught him about accompaniment. ''He would listen carefully and critically to every note in my part,'' Mr. Moore wrote in ''Am I Too Loud?'' ''It was a tough school; after two hours of slogging study he would say it was now time to start work. 'You play that as if you had never been in love.' 'Have you no zest for living?' 'This is angry, all venom, and you sound like a blancmange.' All this was hurled at me with scorn and acidity. Many a time I felt like revolting under the lash of his tongue but, thank God, I stuck it.'' A Good Raconteur The remainder of Mr. Moore's career was a nonstop succession of great singers and instrumentalists, tours and recordings. A spirited raconteur, Mr. Moore was full of stories and opinions about the people he worked with. He enjoyed accompanying the young Yehudi Menuhin, found Chaliapin playful but rather intimidating, and loved Elisabeth Schumann - ''An adorable person who, like her singing, was all sunshine. She sang with a smile.'' He admired the ''shattering honesty'' of John McCormack and compared the voice of Kathleen Ferrier to a ''pure crystal stream.'' Of Mr. Fischer-Dieskau he said: ''He has taken me deeper into the heart of song than I have ever been before.'' And of Miss de los Angeles: ''After a lifetime of listening to hundreds upon hundreds of lovely voices I would say without hesitation that for the sheer quality of sound, Victoria's affects me more than any other.'' Mr. Moore began a second career during World War II when the pianist Myra Hess invited him to lecture on the art of accompaniment at the National Gallery. He repeated his lecture, which was published as ''The Unashamed Accompanist,'' throughout Britain and the United States; it was later recorded and was most recently available on Seraphim Records. Mr. Moore also gave regular master classes throughout the world on the subject of interpretation. He wrote several books, including ''Singer and Accompanist'' (1953), ''The Schubert Song Cycles'' (1975) and ''Farewell Recital'' (1978). After Mr. Moore's retirement from the recital stage, he continued to record, to teach and to lecture for some years. In the summer of 1971, he was the artistic director of a song festival in London. In 1973, he was awarded the Hugo Wolf Medal in Vienna. He is survived by his wife, the former Enid Kathleen Richard, whom he married in 1942."

52806,Earle Warren Is Dead at 79; Jazz Saxophonist and Singer,"Earle Warren, an alto saxophonist and singer best known for his work with the original Count Basie Orchestra, died on Saturday at Hope House Manor in Springfield, Ohio, where he lived.","Earle Warren, an alto saxophonist and singer best known for his work with the original Count Basie Orchestra, died on Saturday at Hope House Manor in Springfield, Ohio, where he lived. He was 79. The cause was complications of a stroke and kidney failure, said a friend, Phil Schaap, the radio disk jockey and jazz historian. Mr. Warren was an important element in the Basie band's brilliance. As the lead alto saxophonist, he led the saxophone section, making sure it swung with authority. From his earliest recordings with the band, done in July 1937, Mr. Warren can be heard driving the section on, his saxophone clear and precise, articulating the rhythms of the tunes. And his occasional solos with the band, on ""Sent for You Yesterday"" or ""Jumpin' at the Woodside,"" for example, show him to be a bluesy, aggressive improviser. Discovered by Basie's Scouts Mr. Warren was born in Springfield into a musical family, and early on he mastered several instruments. By 1933 he was singing with the pianist Art Tatum. A few years later, he moved to Cincinnati, where he led a big band. Count Basie's two main saxophonists, Lester Young and Herschel Evans, were scouting for a lead saxophonist when they heard Mr. Warren. By March 1937, Mr. Warren had joined the band, setting it up to be one of the great American orchestras of the 20th century. Mr. Warren spent the next 13 years with Basie, except for 1946, when he led and recorded with his own band. In 1950, he left the Basie orchestra to freelance. He appeared on ""The Sound of Jazz,"" an important television show that featured performers like Coleman Hawkins, Billie Holiday and Ben Webster, and performed at countless festivals. But in the late 1950's and 60's, when rock-and-roll began to compete with jazz, Mr. Warren started a parallel career, leading a band for the rock impresario Allan Freed, managing James Brown and the Platters, and conducting Diana Ross's band. In 1972 he started the Countsmen, a well-recieved band, with which he played until his retirement in 1992. He is survived by a sister, Nancy Mitchell of Springfield; a brother, Robert, of Tulsa, Okla., and seven children. A memorial service is to be held on June 20 at 8:30 P.M. at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. WKCR-FM is planning a memorial broadcast of Mr. Warren's music from 5 A.M.

14639,Trisha Brown Dies at 80; Cerebral Choreographer and a Postmodern Pillar,"Trisha Brown, the choreographer and exemplar of the founding generation of American postmodern dance, died on Saturday in San Antonio.","Trisha Brown, the choreographer and exemplar of the founding generation of American postmodern dance, died on Saturday in San Antonio. She was 80. Barbara Dufty, the executive director of Ms. Brown's dance company, confirmed the death. Ms. Brown had been treated for vascular dementia since 2011. Few dance inventors have so combined the cerebral and sensuous sides of dance as Ms. Brown did, and few have been as influential. Her choreography, showcased primarily in New York, helped shape generations of modern dance creators into the 21st century. [ Mikhail Baryshnikov, Laurie Anderson and other artists speak on working with Ms. Brown. ] In December 2012, it was announced that the two dances she had made the previous year would be her last. By that point, she had been an international figure for over 30 years, choreographing for the Paris Opera Ballet, collaborating with Mikhail Baryshnikov, and commissioning stage designs from Robert Rauschenberg and other eminent visual artists, including Donald Judd and Nancy Graves. In 1983, she won European as well as American acclaim for ''Set and Reset.'' This intensely sensuous theater piece, with music by Laurie Anderson and designs by Rauschenberg, became the most beloved work ever made in postmodern dance. In the 1980s, her influence was cited by the American choreographers David Gordon, Mark Morris and Stephen Petronio; and her work began to join the repertories of other dance companies. In 1988, the French government named Ms. Brown Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres. In January 2000 she was promoted to Officier and in 2004 to Commandeur. In 1991, she was named a MacArthur fellow, the first female choreographer to achieve this distinction. Patricia Ann Brown was born on Nov. 25, 1936, to the former Dorothy Louise Abel, an English teacher, and Martell W. Brown, a salesman. In later years she often spoke of her debt to the landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. In public conversation with the choreographer Merce Cunningham (also from Washington State), she once remarked, ''The rain forest was my first art class.'' Ms. Brown graduated from Weatherwax High School in Aberdeen in 1954 and studied modern dance at Mills College, in Oakland, Calif., earning a degree in 1958. She taught dance at Reed College in Oregon for the next academic year and also studied at the American Dance Festival summer schools of 1958, 1959 and 1961, learning especially from Louis Horst, the veteran pedagogue of modern dance composition. Her next chief influences were the postmodern choreographer and teacher Robert Ellis Dunn and John Cage, the radical composer whose ideas on music and art opened up many possibilities. After moving to New York in 1961, she helped found the avant-garde Judson Dance Theater group the next year. Like her colleagues Mr. Gordon, Steve Paxton and Yvonne Rainer, she made dances that eliminated bravura, academic technique, acting and musicality -- the hallmarks of modern dance as it had been developed by Martha Graham and others, not to mention ballet. In 1970, Ms. Brown helped found another experimental collective, Grand Union, as well as her own troupe, the Trisha Brown Dance Company. In those years she worked, as a rule, in unconventional spaces and without music. The term ''postmodern dance'' was not coined until the late 1970s, and perhaps it can now be seen that Ms. Brown and others were leading dance at that time into the radical extremes of modernism. Cunningham, whom she greatly admired, had made dance independent from music and design; she in turn helped to make it independent of technical rigor and, in the 1970s, to present it with no musical accompaniment. This was ''democratic dance,'' composed largely of movement that the average untrained dancer could do, albeit in new combinations. Some dances were performed barefoot, others in sneakers. Three historic works that Ms. Brown made in 1971 suggest much in their titles alone: ''Walking on the Wall,'' ''Roof Piece'' and ''Accumulation.'' ''Walking'' had dancers suspended in harnesses moving sideways along walls; ''Roof'' spread its dancers across 12 roofs on 10 SoHo blocks; ''Accumulation'' was a formal study in graduated movement, with repeated phrases building in complexity -- like sentences that each time added one word. The experimental dance of that era, embodied in those pieces, set itself up against virtuosity. Ms. Brown nonetheless now became a virtuoso of a new kind. In 1978 she took her ''Accumulation'' solo and embellished it, showing, in ''Accumulation With Talking Plus Water Motor,'' just how many things could be done simultaneously. She could coordinate several physical acts while talking, as if illustrating multiple trains of thought in action. Having earlier pared dance down to its basics, she was now rebuilding it in new ways, and it was then that she became a seminal figure of truly postmodern dance. A classic of hers from this era was ''Opal Loop/Cloud Installation'' (1980), among the purest of all pure-dance works. A quartet in silence, it is its own music, the connections and ricochets between the dancers making its harmonies marvelous. Here ''the line of least resistance'' became gorgeous: a fascinating chain sequence of hitches, ripples, shimmies, hops, knee bends. The style was often called ''release technique,'' and some accredited its invention to her. (In fact, release technique was devised by another native of Washington State, Joan Skinner.) Ms. Brown, a gently but memorably witty woman, simply described her own idiom as ''the line of least resistance,'' neatly evoking the rippling chain-effect of through-the-body impulses and ricochets that characterized much of her dance. By this time, Ms. Brown was already moving on, starting a different kind of dance theater. From 1979 she made a series of pieces that turned her purity into a new kind of theatricality, sometimes ravishing and generally novel, working with designers like Rauschenberg, and with sound scores and music by Ms. Anderson, Judd and others. (When asked why she had stopped choreographing in silence, she once replied, ''I got fed up with listening to all the goddamn coughing.'') Although the names of works from this era are uninviting -- ''Glacial Decoy'' (1979), ''Set and Reset'' (1983), ''Lateral Pass'' (1985), ''Newark'' (1987), ''Astral Convertible'' (1989), ''Foray Fort'' (1990) and ''Astral Converted'' (1991) -- the works themselves excited lasting adoration. These remained pure-dance creations, with ingeniously inventive choreography, but their music, costumes and dcor made them potently theatrical: Each had a strong atmosphere in which visual effects and music made contributions. It was these pieces, notably ''Set and Reset,'' that brought her a new kind of worldwide prestige. By the late 1980s, she was having seasons in big theaters like City Center in New York and Sadler's Wells in London; and she became a darling of the French. She never quite abandoned this style, returning to it in 2011 for her final creation, ''I'm going to toss my arms -- if you catch them they're yours,'' which had designs by her husband, Burt Barr, and music by Alvin Curran. From the late 1980s on, Ms. Brown opened up her next phase: a new engagement with classical music. The composers Monteverdi, Bach, Rameau, Schubert and Bizet supplied her with the challenges she needed, and her responses were never conventional in musicality or theatricality. Her ''M.O.'' (1995) was based on Bach's ''Musical Offering''; in 2002, she staged Schubert's ''Winterreise'' with the eminent baritone Simon Keenlyside (a superb mover). For decades, Ms. Brown was her own greatest dancer, creating many remarkable solos for herself. ''If You Couldn't See Me'' (1994) memorably fused her cerebral and sensuous sides. The underpinning notion -- a gimmick, you might say -- was that her back remained turned to the audience throughout. The transcendent factor lay in her spine's fluidity. When, in 1989, Mr. Baryshnikov turned from being a ballet specialist to a master investigator of American modern dance, Ms. Brown was a favorite collaborator. That solo in 1995 became a duet, ''You Can See Us.'' As danced in 1996, this showed Mr. Baryshnikov facing front; Ms. Brown still kept her back to the audience. From the 1930s on, a series of choreographers had made New York a haven for pure dance. Of those choreographers, Cunningham and Ms. Brown were among the brainiest. Devotees of difficulty, they never needed to court an audience. The news that her 2011 dances would be her last -- she had made over 100 dances, many of which had been recorded on film and video -- followed Cunningham's death in 2009 and the closing of his company in December 2011. Plans for the limited afterlife of her company were announced in the ensuing months and years. In January 2016, the Brooklyn Academy of Music gave a season to the company's final presentation of her ''proscenium'' theater pieces. Since 2015, ''In Plain Site'' seasons have been given in special locations, excerpting dances from her repertoire and asking audiences to walk around different rooms to observe the various dances (an entirely Brownian idea). In 2016, the art historian Susan Rosenberg published ''Trisha Brown: Choreography as Visual Art'' (Wesleyan University Press). Mr. Barr, Ms. Brown's husband, died in November. She is survived by her son, Adam; four grandchildren; a brother, Gordon; and a sister, Louisa Brown. Since the 1980s, Brown dances have often been performed by other companies. Her ''Set and Reset'' is usually included in the undergraduate curriculum for French dance students. The choreographer Mr. Petronio, a member of her dance company in the early 1980s, added her ''Glacial Decoy'' to his company's repertoire in 2016. But Ms. Brown's work is not easily codified, and its language may prove elusive to dancers from generations who did not know the casual body language of the last century. All dance legacies are fragile; hers may prove especially so. Any avant-gardist of this pertinacity should continue to provoke debate. How great was even Ms. Brown's greatest work? That motto of hers, ''the line of least resistance,'' has sometimes suggested her own limitations: Her work has often seemed to lack drama. Or did it rather extend our idea of drama? Much of Ms. Brown's work created intensely kinesthetic currents. Audiences felt them even as they watched them. Dances in which nothing happened became dances in which much was eventful."

He was 85. His death was announced by his manager, Pamela Sutton. She did not specify a cause. Mr. Bilk had been a leading figure on Britain's traditional jazz scene for several years when he recorded ''Stranger on the Shore,'' a wistful ballad that he wrote with Robert Mellin, with string accompaniment in 1961. It reached No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart in 1962, making him one of the first British performers to achieve that distinction. Born Bernard Stanley Bilk in Pensford, a village in Somerset, England, on Jan. 28, 1929, he adopted the stage name Acker from a local slang word for ''friend.'' He learned the clarinet as a bored army conscript in Egypt after World War II and went on to play with the trumpeter Ken Colyer and other British exponents of New Orleans-style jazz before forming his own band. Mr. Bilk attributed his distinctive vibrato to two childhood accidents. He lost part of a finger in a sledding accident and two teeth in a fight at school. Known for his goatee, garish waistcoat and bowler hat as well as his smooth playing style, he remained a regular on British television with a large and loyal following long after jazz was displaced from the charts by rock 'n' roll. He was named a member of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 2001. He is survived by his wife, Jean, and a son and daughter."

He was 29. The cause was suicide, a statement from his manager said. Mr. Young had appeared on ''Rizzoli & Isles,'' a police procedural set in Boston and based on novels by Tess Gerritsen, since its debut in 2010. He played Barry Frost, a computer-savvy homicide detective who can't stand the sight of blood, who is the partner of Jane Rizzoli, played by Angie Harmon. TNT announced on Monday that ''Rizzoli & Isles'' had been renewed for another season. Mr. Young's first major role came in 1998, when he played the title character on ''The Famous Jett Jackson.'' The show followed the child star of an action show who decides to move production back to suburban North Carolina from Hollywood so he can resume life with his family. '' 'The Famous Jett Jackson' makes instructive drama out of the sentimental truism that family and friends trump fame and wealth,'' Marc Weingarten wrote in an article about diversity on television in The New York Times. ''But Jett, a hip-hop-loving kid played with guileless charm by Lee Thompson Young, is never sitcom-bland.'' Mr. Young, who grew up in South Carolina, said he sympathized with the character. ''I get out of L.A. as often as I can,'' he said. Lee Thompson Young was born on Feb. 1, 1984, in Columbia, S.C. He played the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a school production when he was 10. Two years later he accompanied his mother to New York so she could attend Union Theological Seminary, and once there he found an agent. He earned a film production degree from the University of Southern California long after he began acting professionally. Mr. Young had recurring roles on the NBC comedy ''Scrubs'' and the WB superhero drama ''Smallville.'' He also acted in films, appearing alongside Billy Bob Thornton in the high school football drama ''Friday Night Lights'' (2004) and with Laurence Fishburne in ''Akeelah and the Bee'' (2006).

29886,"Cresson Kearny, Expert on Nuclear Survival, Dies at 89","Cresson Kearny, an inventor and specialist in jungle warfare who wrote a best-selling manual on surviving a nuclear attack, died on Dec. 18 in Montrose, Colo.","Cresson Kearny, an inventor and specialist in jungle warfare who wrote a best-selling manual on surviving a nuclear attack, died on Dec. 18 in Montrose, Colo. He was 89. The cause was complications of a stroke, said his daughter Stephanie Kearny, who is writing a biography of him. His manual, ""Nuclear War Survival Skills,"" is available free on the Internet at www.oism.org/nwss. It includes instructions on how to build and furnish fallout shelters, complete with a do-it-yourself fallout meter, his own invention, which can be made of materials commonly found in the home. The manual includes a foreword by Edward Teller, the architect of the hydrogen bomb, as well as an admiring biographical note by Eugene P. Wigner, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, who writes that in 1964, when he was authorized by the Atomic Energy Commission to set up the Civil Defense Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, Mr. Kearny was among the first researchers he hired. First published in 1979 by the laboratory, the book had sold more than 600,000 copies by the mid-1990's. Mr. Kearny also allowed it to be republished by anyone without obligation to pay royalties. Updated in 1987, the manual offers designs for six basic types of shelter, suitable for environmental conditions in different parts of the United States. Designed to be built in a trench or above ground by untrained people in 48 hours or less, the shelters are made of wood, dirt and other materials found around the house. They have been tested extensively by amateurs at Oak Ridge and around the country and have been improved upon over several decades. Cresson Henry Kearny (his last name is pronounced Carney) was born on Jan. 7, 1914, in San Antonio, the elder of two sons of Clinton Hall Kearny, a civil engineer, and Mary Chabot Cresson Kearny. While he was attending Texas Military Institute in San Antonio, his father died and his mother declared bankruptcy. He later went to Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania for a year and won a scholarship to Princeton, from which he graduated in 1937 with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. He attended Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship and graduated in 1939 from Queen's College with a degree in geology. After Oxford, Mr. Kearny joined a Royal Geographic Society expedition in the Peruvian Andes. He then worked as an exploration geologist for Standard Oil in the Orinoco jungles of Venezuela. Persuaded that the United States would soon be at war, he quit his job in 1940, packed his specialized jungle gear and reported for active duty in Texas as a first lieutenant in the Army Reserve. In February 1941 he transferred to Panama, where he helped develop tactics and special equipment for foot soldiers. Later, as a major, he was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services in Southeast China. In 1943, he married May Willacy Eskridge of San Antonio. They had five children: a son, Cresson, now of Oakland, Calif., and four daughters, Adelia Willacy Kearny, Diana Catherine Kearny Fosse, Susanna Joyce Kearny and Stephanie Kearny, all of Albuquerque. They survive him, along with six grandchildren and one great-grandchild. After the war, a poliolike disease left Mr. Kearny incapacitated for decades, but he continued to invent and promote specialized combat equipment, some of which was used in the Korean, Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars. His health later improved. Increasingly concerned about nuclear war, Mr. Kearny began to work independently on nuclear survival. In 1961, Herman Kahn, a prominent nuclear strategist, invited him to join the Hudson Institute to study nuclear defense issues. Three years later, Dr. Wigner recruited him to Oak Ridge, and he began the projects that led to his book on surviving nuclear war. As the cold war thawed, he shifted his concerns to the danger of a limited nuclear attack by rogue nations and terrorists, his daughter Stephanie said. ""Throughout his life,"" she said, ""he believed in being prepared for trouble."""
51863,"Louis P. Martini, 79, Leader in Wine Industry","Louis P. Martini, a leading figure in the California wine business and chairman of the Louis M. Martini Winery in Napa Valley, died Monday at his home in St. Helena, Calif.","Louis P. Martini, a leading figure in the California wine business and chairman of the Louis M. Martini Winery in Napa Valley, died Monday at his home in St. Helena, Calif. He was 79. The cause of death was cancer, his family said. The Martini family has been involved in the California wine industry for more than 70 years. Mr. Martini's father, Louis M. Martini, founded the family winery as the L. M. Martini Grape Products Company in 1922 in Kingsburg, near Fresno. The elder Martini, who never thought of Prohibition as anything more than a temporary aberration, began planning the expansion of his business while other wine companies were closing. In 1933, he moved to the Napa Valley and changed the company's name to the Louis M. Martini Winery. Louis Peter Martini was born in Livermore and grew up in Kingsburg, working in the winery and in the vineyards as a boy. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1941 and spent four years in the Army Air Forces during World War II. He joined the winery as vice president in 1946 and became the winemaker in 1954; wines he made in the 1950's and 60's are still prized by collectors. At 6 feet 4 inches, Mr. Martini was a gentle giant, who worked in the shadow of his flamboyant father until the elder Martini's death in 1974. To an extent, the son's self-effacing nature is reflected in the winery's reputation. While he was a major producer of fine wine and an important behind-the-scenes industry leader, Mr. Martini avoided the well-publicized social side of Napa Valley life, and his winery rarely appeared in trendy articles about the wine business. But his achievements were numerous. In the 50's and 60's, he helped improve grape quality by identifying and propagating superior grape clones. He developed vineyards in the Carneros district of the valley when it was considered useful only for grazing sheep, and he is credited with making the first Carneros varietal pinot noir in 1952. Today, many of the best California pinot noirs come from Carneros. Mr. Martini also made the first varietal merlot wine in the United States with his merlot blend of 1968 to 1970. And he was a pioneer in the use of mechanical grape harvesting. From 1968 to 1985, he was president and general manager of the winery, which remains in family hands. His daughter Carolyn is president and chief executive. Mr. Martini was a founder and former chairman of the Wine Institute and a charter member of the American Society of Enologists. Surviving, besides his daughter, are his wife, Elizabeth Martinelli Martini; two sons, Michael, of St. Helena, the current Martini winemaker, and Peter, of Seattle; another daughter, Patricia, of San Francisco, and four grandchildren."

He was 65 years old. Mr. Short was a longtime contributor to the Democratic Party and a close friend of Hubert H. Humphrey. After the former Vice President's death in 1978, Mr. Short ran for the Senate in Minnesota, spending more than $1 million of his own money in a losing cause. As Bob Short, he was known to sports fans, sometimes not very fondly, as the owner first of the Minneapolis Lakers of the National Basketball Association and later of the Washington Senators, an American League baseball team. He upset local fans when he moved the Lakers to Los Angeles and the Senators to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where they became the Texas Rangers. He acquired the Lakers in 1957 and the Senators in 1968. Neither team fared well financially or on the field under his ownership. Mr. Short was born in Minneapolis on July 20, 1917. He graduated from Fordham University Law School, but he set out in the trucking industry by buying into a small company with borrowed money and turning the concern into a large freight hauler. Owned Minneapolis Hotels He earned his fortune in the trucking and hotel industries. He headed Admiral Merchants Motor Freight Inc. and owned several hotels in Minneapolis, including the 700-room Leamington, which served as his headquarters. Mr. Short was a dark horse in a race for the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party's nomination for Governor in 1966. Two years later, when Vice President Humphrey was running for President, he asked Mr. Short to serve as treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Short held the post until the Democrats lost in November, leaving behind a plan for wiping out the party's campaign debt of more than $7 million. Lost 1978 Senate Race He returned to politics in 1978, when Muriel Humphrey, who was appointed to fill her late husband's seat in the Senate, decided not to run that fall for the four years remaining on his term. In a move that divided an already shaken party, Mr. Short made a well-financed bid for the Senate seat, but lost to David Durenberger, a Republican. When he took full control of the Washington Senators in 1969, Mr. Short said he would keep the team in the capital. But by 1971, after $3 million in losses, he got permission from the league's other owners to move the franchise to Arlington, Tex., where he eventually sold the club. He is survived by his wife, the former Marion McCann; three sons, Robert, Brian and Kevin, and four daughters, Marianne, Elizabeth, Carolyn and Colleen."
19827,"Charles Sellier Jr., 67, 'Grizzly Adams' Creator","Charles Sellier Jr., a producer and director of family-friendly films and television shows and the creator of the popular 1970s NBC series ''The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams,'' died on Monday at his home near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.","Charles Sellier Jr., a producer and director of family-friendly films and television shows and the creator of the popular 1970s NBC series ''The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams,'' died on Monday at his home near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. He was 67. Darryl Howard, a longtime friend, said that Mr. Sellier died unexpectedly but he did not specify the cause. Almost always working independently, Mr. Sellier (pronounced sell-ee-AY) produced, and often wrote and directed, more than 30 movies and over 200 television shows -- many with religious themes, some historical and others examining science. But he was best known for writing the 1972 novel ''The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams,'' which he later adapted for a movie and the television series. Loosely based on an actual person who escaped into the wilderness in 1853 after being accused of a murder he didn't commit, Grizzly Adams is a bearded, barrel-chested man (played by Dan Haggerty) who counts among his friends raccoons, skunks, ferrets, deer, coyotes, porcupines, an eagle and, of course, the abandoned grizzly bear cub who matures into a powerful companion named Ben. Adams's human companions are an old trader, Mad Jack the Mountain Man (Denver Pyle), and an Indian named Nakoma (Don Shanks). While Grizzly protects the wildlife from harm and aids people coming through the forest, he must watch out for bounty hunters seeking the price on his head. The series ran on NBC from early 1977 until late 1978, but concluded more definitively with a 1982 television movie, ''The Capture of Grizzly Adams,'' in which a bounty hunter draws Grizzly back to civilization and Grizzly proves his innocence. Among Mr. Sellier's other films, usually as writer and producer, are ''In Search of Noah's Ark,'' ''In Search of Historic Jesus,'' ''The Bermuda Triangle'' and ''The Lincoln Conspiracy,'' based on a 1977 book he wrote with David W. Balsiger. The book and movie theorized that Lincoln's assassination resulted from a conspiracy involving Northern politicians determined to block his lenient Reconstruction policies. Mr. Sellier's television shows and mini-series include ''Mark Twain's America,'' ''George W. Bush: Faith in the White House'' and ''The Greatest Heroes of the Bible.'' Charles Edward Sellier Jr. was born in Pascagoula, Miss., on Nov. 9, 1943, the only child of Charles and Gladys Carson Sellier. His father was a shipping clerk working on the Gulf Coast. Mr. Sellier is survived by his wife of 25 years, Julie Magnuson, and a son, William. Faith suffused his life. ''He was born a Cajun Catholic, then became a Mormon and later an evangelical Christian,'' Mr. Howard said of his friend. ''He was very devout, studied the Bible and prayed every day without fail.'' Still, beyond the religious themes in much of his work, Mr. Sellier saw himself as a pragmatic businessman. He followed market research, he told The New York Times in 2006, producing films because he saw an appetite for them. ''You may come back to me in five years and ask, 'Why is the only thing you make sci-fi movies?' '' he said."
5265,"Ray Dolby, Who Transformed Movie Sound, Dies at 80","Ray Dolby, the sound pioneer who revolutionized the recording industry with the invention of the Dolby noise-reduction system and transformed cinema and home entertainment with Dolby digital surround sound, died on Thursday at his home in San Francisco.","Ray Dolby, the sound pioneer who revolutionized the recording industry with the invention of the Dolby noise-reduction system and transformed cinema and home entertainment with Dolby digital surround sound, died on Thursday at his home in San Francisco. He was 80. He developed Alzheimer's disease several years ago and received a diagnosis of acute leukemia in July, his company, Dolby Laboratories, said in announcing the death. The Dolby name became synonymous with high fidelity. For his pioneering contributions to audio engineering, Dr. Dolby received an Oscar, several Emmy Awards and a Grammy. Trained in engineering and physics, he started Dolby Laboratories in London in 1965 and soon afterward introduced technology that produced cleaner, crisper sound by electronically reducing the hiss generated by analog tape recording. Decca Records was the first customer to buy the Dolby system. The noise-reduction technology quickly became a staple of major labels. Film studios began adopting the system in the 1970s, beginning with Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film ''A Clockwork Orange.'' Dolby Laboratories introduced digital surround-sound technology to home entertainment in the 1980s. Film industry executives credit Dr. Dolby with enabling directors like Steven Spielberg to endow sound with the same emotional intensity as pictures. The producer Sidney Ganis, a former president of Paramount Pictures, recalled the powerful scene in the 1977 Spielberg film ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' in which the mother spaceship of an alien race hovers above Devils Tower in Wyoming and communicates with scientists on the ground through a series of electronically produced tones. ''The sound of the spaceship knocked the audience on its rear with the emotional content,'' Mr. Ganis, a former president of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, said in an interview. ''That was created by the director, but provided by the technology that Ray Dolby invented.'' Ray Milton Dolby was born on Jan. 18, 1933, in Portland, Ore., to Earl Milton Dolby and the former Esther Strand. His father was a salesman. An inveterate tinkerer with mechanical devices, Dr. Dolby was interested in how sound worked from a young age and took clarinet lessons. As a teenager, he met Alexander Poniatoff, a Russian migr and electrical engineer who in 1944 started Ampex, a pioneering maker of audio and later video recorders, in San Carlos, Calif. Mr. Poniatoff had gone to Ray Dolby's high school looking for a projectionist for a talk he was going to give and young Ray volunteered. Impressed with his abilities, Mr. Poniatoff invited him to work for Ampex. ''I was so far ahead in my credits that I didn't have to worry about getting into college, so I went to school three hours a day and worked five at Ampex,'' Dr. Dolby told The Los Angeles Times in 1988. Hired in 1949, Dr. Dolby developed the electronic components of the company's videotape recording system. He left the company in 1957, the same year he graduated from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, deciding to pursue graduate studies at Cambridge University in Britain on a Marshall Scholarship and a fellowship from the National Science Foundation. He received a postdoctoral degree in physics from Cambridge in 1961. While at Cambridge, he met a German summer student named Dagmar Bumert; they were married in 1966. She survives him, along with two sons, Tom and David, and four grandchildren. In mid-1962, Dr. Dolby saw an announcement from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in a Sunday newspaper; Unesco was seeking an expert to help the government of India set up a new national laboratory to develop scientific and industrial instruments. Dr. Dolby applied and won the assignment. He set off for India in 1963 and traveled the country assessing its scientific instruments industry and how the new research lab might help advance it. His stint in India turned out to be pivotal to his thinking about the problems of sound. In his free time, Dr. Dolby hired professional musicians to play at his home so that he could make live recordings using his Ampex tape recorder. He had long been bothered by the tape hiss that distorted the sound quality of the recordings; the slower the tape speed, the noisier it became. ''I was doing recording at Cambridge, and I thought about noise reduction,'' he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1987. ''In India, I had my recorder with me and thought about noise reduction.'' So, after two years in India, he decided to tackle the problem. Returning to England, he founded Dolby Laboratories. First he developed noise-reduction technology that eliminated the hiss, even at low tape speeds, making cassette players sound like high-quality systems. Then he tackled another problem: in the late 1960s, the quality of sound in films lagged far behind that of home stereos. ''Studios were using the same sound technology as 'Gone With The Wind,' 35 years earlier,'' Walter Murch, an Oscar-winning film editor and sound designer, said in an interview on Friday. When Dolby Laboratories introduced noise-reduction and multichannel sound to cinema in the 1970s, Mr. Murch said, the technology was a game changer. ''It's like going from black and white film to three-dimensional color high definition,'' Mr. Murch said. ''That's probably exaggerated, but not much.'' Dolby Laboratories gained wide attention in 1977 with the release of ''Close Encounters'' and ''Star Wars,'' both of which used Dolby Stereo, a system for recording films in multichannel sound. In the 1980s, the company introduced surround-sound technology in television, compact discs and laser discs. Dr. Dolby was named to the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 1987 and awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by President Clinton in 1997. He served as chairman of the Dolby board from 1965 until 2009, retiring in 2011. Dolby Laboratories is continuing to explore new ways to experience entertainment; one project is focused on investing small devices with cinema-quality sound. Already Dolby audio is a feature of Amazon's Kindle Fire HD tablets as well as some Android phones and tablets. ''Ray Dolby made the inventors the heroes of the company,'' Kevin Yeaman, the chief executive of Dolby Laboratories, said in a telephone interview on Friday. To honor Dr. Dolby in 2012, the company secured the rights for 20 years to name the auditorium that is home to the Academy Awards the Dolby Theater."

Rosenfield, who helped create the school lunch program in 1946 and then supervised the resettlement of European refugees in the United States, died on Friday at his home in Washington. He was 83. In 1946, as the chief assistant to the Administrator of the Federal Security Agency, a precursor of the Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. Rosenfield helped draft the legislation that created the school lunch program. Two years later, after serving as delegate to the United Nations Economic and Social Council in Geneva, he was named by President Harry S. Truman as Commissioner of the Displaced Persons Commission, which was responsible for supervising the admission and resettlement of refugees after World War II. By the time the commission expired four years later, Mr. Rosenfield and a staff of 2,500 had helped bring more than 500,000 refugees to the United States. A native of Brooklyn who graduated from City College and in 1934 received a law degree from Columbia University, Mr. Rosenfield gained entree to public service as a protege of Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. During his undergraduate days, Mr. Rosenfield met Leonora Cohen, the daughter of the renowned City College philosophy professor Morris Raphael Cohen, and they married. In 1942, after seven years as secretary to the Commissioner of the New York City Board of Education, Mr. Rosenfield, who became a recognized expert on education administration, went to Washington, initially as counsel to the Federal Security Agency's Office of Education and later as assistant to the Federal Security Administrator. After leaving Government service in 1953, Mr. Rosenfield entered private legal practice in Washington. As a result of his work with the Displaced Persons Commission, Mr. Rosenfield, who contributed many articles to education, legal and other scholarly publications, became a recognized expert on immigration law and a passionate advocate of liberal immigration policies. In the 1950's, for example, he was a co-author of ""Immigration Law and Procedure,"" a multivolume reference work that has continued to be published through successive revisions. Yet his most lasting contribution to public policy literature may have been an aside in his last official act in Government service. According to Merriam-Webster researchers, a final report that Mr. Rosenfield wrote to President Truman on immigration policy in 1953 contains the earliest known printed use of the term ""baby boom."" He is survived by a daughter, Marianne Smigelskis of Chicago."

He was 49 and lived in West Hollywood, Calif. Elisabeth Nonas, a close friend, said the cause was complications from AIDS. For many people, Mr. Monette's memoir and a previous book about nursing a lover who died of AIDS humanized the tragedy of the disease and the torment of denying one's homosexuality, but it also brought to life the rich relationships that some gay men enjoy. When he won the National Book Award, Mr. Monette said that writing the autobiography ""literally kept me alive"" after he contracted AIDS, but he also said he feared it would be his last published work. He said the award sent a message that gay and lesbian literature ""is significant."" Mr. Monette was born in Lawrence, Mass., on Oct. 16, 1945. In ""Becoming a Man,"" he described growing up in an ordinary middle-class world in which he became obsessed with his homosexual yearnings but had to suppress them: ""Never lost my temper, never raised my voice.

14491,Francis Fraser Dies at 91; Cashed In on His Cruelty,"Francis Fraser, a British underworld enforcer known as Mad Frankie, whose life of crime and torture led to a lucrative retirement chronicling his own grisly deeds in books, films and lectures, on stage and television, and as a ''gangland'' tour guide, died on Wednesday in London.","Francis Fraser, a British underworld enforcer known as Mad Frankie, whose life of crime and torture led to a lucrative retirement chronicling his own grisly deeds in books, films and lectures, on stage and television, and as a ''gangland'' tour guide, died on Wednesday in London. He was 90. His death was announced on his official website. British news organizations said he died at King's College Hospital in South London, where he had been admitted for a hip or leg operation and slipped into a coma on Friday resulting from complications during surgery. Eddie Richardson, the head of a crime family with which he once worked, told The Associated Press, ''He's had a long life, and I don't think he's done too bad.'' Mr. Fraser is well remembered in the back streets of South London, where he sadistically worked over many a victim with ax and pliers, and in West End theaters and broadcast studios, where he drew audiences into the raptures of villainy with accounts of his exploits from the 1930s into the '80s. Capitalizing on public fascination with the macabre, he made a remarkable transition from criminal and prison life to author and celebrity, becoming a household name in Britain in his 70s. His oeuvre included six ghostwritten books, a feature film, a documentary about his life, television and stage shows, newspaper and magazine articles, DVDs, CDs, university lectures and dinner talks. Many Americans, too, may recall his London and British bus tours, showing gawkers the prisons where he served time, the country mansions he looted, his old haunts and robbery scenes, places where gangs clashed and he was shot, and where, he said, he had maimed and killed scores of people. It was hard to tell how much of it was true, but Mr. Fraser was an engaging performer: a small, wiry character with menacing eyes under bushy brows, a face lined with the crags of knife scars and punches, and a cockney twang that conveyed the ring of authenticity. His story, told in person, on his website, and in police, court and penal records, was cheerfully gruesome. While officials called him Britain's most dangerous criminal, suspected in as many as 40 killings, Mr. Fraser was tried for murder only once, in 1966. The case was dropped after a key witness experienced a memory lapse. But years later, Mr. Fraser told Seth Linder, a freelance writer, what had happened. ''It was that lovely fight at Mr. Smith's nightclub,'' Mr. Fraser said. ''This guy shot me in the thigh. The police alleged I took the gun from him and killed him, which, of course, I did. I wasn't going to pat him on the back, was I?'' His exploits began in childhood with street fights, shoplifting and muggings. He became an army deserter and black marketeer during World War II, then a smash-and-grab jewelry thief. In the 1960s, he graduated to armed robberies, kidnapping and strong-arm duties for a vicious London gang led by Mr. Richardson and a brother, Charlie. The gang's members ran extortion and protection rackets, with mock trials, torture and sometimes death for those who did not pay up. The authorities said they liked to remove victims' toes with bolt cutters. For disloyalty to the gang, they prescribed blowtorches and whippings. Mr. Fraser's specialty was nailing people to the floor and extracting their teeth with pliers. Convicted of 26 crimes, including prison riots and attacks on guards and inmates, he said he served 42 years behind bars and was certified insane three times, although he insisted that he had faked madness to lighten punishments with hospital stays. He probably exaggerated his prison time. Mr. Fraser was part of a London underworld riddled with a generation of cockney gangsters in bespoke suits, like the Richardsons and the Kray twins, Reggie and Ronnie, whose names and pictures were as likely to be found in the society pages as in the crime sheets. He described matter-of-fact brutality on his website. Under ''The Chopping of Eric Mason,'' a thug who threatened to accuse him falsely of starting a pub brawl, he related: ''I kidnapped him and threw him in the motor, took him to our headquarters, Atlantic Machines, and chopped him up with me chopper, me ax. Then took him to the London Hospital and dumped him out there with a blanket around him.'' In ''Mad Frank's Diary: A Chronicle of the Life of Britain's Most Notorious Villain'' (2000), he was more circumspect: ''Sometimes when I'm signing books I'm asked how many people I've killed, and I reply that the police say 40, and I'm not going to argue with them.'' Francis Davidson Fraser was born in South London on Dec. 13, 1923, one of five children of a Canadian seaman and an Irish washerwoman. He grew up in poverty in a Roman Catholic household, where he learned to recite prayers in Latin. At 17 he was sent to Borstal, the juvenile detention center, where he was birched for attacking a guard. His prison terms, for assault, torture, robbery, extortion and rioting, ranged from two to 10 years and were so frequent that he rarely spent more than a few years at large. In a prison library, he discovered books. ''I used to love P. G. Wodehouse -- Jeeves and all that,'' he told Mr. Linder. ''In fact, that's what gave me the idea to start doing country houses.'' He said he helped plan, but did not otherwise join in, the 2.6-million-pound ''Great Train Robbery'' in 1963, then the largest cash heist in British history. In prison, he met Irish Republican Army terrorists, and at Brixton in 1968 he encountered James Earl Ray, then awaiting extradition to the United States for the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Fraser said little about his home life. One memoir cited three sons, Frank Jr., David and Patrick, ''from an early relationship,'' and another son, Francis, ''from a marriage to Doreen.'' In recent decades, he lived in South London with Marilyn Wisbey, the daughter of Tommy Wisbey, a Great Train Robbery culprit. Information about his survivors was not available. In 1991, Mr. Fraser was shot in the head outside a London nightclub. He insisted that the assailant, never caught, had acted for corrupt officials who wanted to silence his new career as an author and entertainer. Besides ''Mad Frank's Diary,'' his books, all ghostwritten by James Morton, included ''Mad Frank: Memoirs of a Life of Crime'' (1994), ''Mad Frank and Friends'' (1999), ''Mad Frank's Britain'' and ''Mad Frank's London'' (both 2002), and ''Mad Frank's Underworld History of Britain'' (2007). He acted in a dozen television shows and several theatrical productions, and in 1999 appeared in a one-man show in London, ''An Evening With Mad Frankie Fraser,'' which later toured Britain. He also appeared as an East End crime boss in the 1996 feature film ''Hard Men,'' and in a 2007 documentary, ''Mad Frank.'' In interviews, he remained almost nonchalant about his life of crime, saying the general public had little to fear. ''Sure I was violent,'' Mr. Fraser told the British newspaper The Independent in 1994, ''but only to people like myself.''"

He was 87 years old. The Mayor, who is 57, canceled scheduled appearances and meetings yesterday, and, according to his press office, will make no public appearances until Wednesday. He is scheduled to be in Albany then to press his legislative agenda. In speeches and casual remarks, Mayor Koch made references to his father with humor and poignancy. He told of how, when he was in the House of Representatives, his father had called to complain that he was not enjoying retirement. ''Eddie,'' his father said, ''I'm so bored. Could you get me a job in the post office?'' ''Papa,'' the son replied, ''do you want me to go to jail?'' Other times, the Mayor talked about hardships during his childhood, and his father's lack of great success as a businessman. Without fondness, the younger Mr. Koch recalled having to work for tips as a boy in the hat-check concession his father had operated in a Newark catering hall. A Native of Poland Louis Koch was born in Poland in 1894 and emigrated to the United States when he was 14. He worked for years as a furrier in Manhattan, but during the 1930's, he moved his family to Newark, working in the fur business and at the catering hall. In the 1940's, Mr. Koch returned to New York City, and in 1976, two years after his retirement, he moved to Florida. He was married in 1919 to Joyce Silpe, the Mayor's mother, who died in 1960. A year later, Mr. Koch married Rose Klein. On Jan. 1, 1978, when his son was sworn in for his first term as Mayor, Mr. Koch sat in the front row. Someone asked him how felt. ''Look,'' he said, ''who wouldn't be excited? How many fathers have the luck, the happiness?'' Besides his wife and the Mayor, Mr. Koch is survived by another son, Harold; a daughter, Pat Thaler, and four grandchildren. A private funeral service was held yesterday in Fort Lauderdale, and another is scheduled for tomorrow in New York City. The location of the service and burial plans were not made public."
45689,"Dorothy Schiff, 86, Ex-Post Owner, Dies","Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.","Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old. The Post's vice president for editorial and administration, Peter Faris, said she had died of cancer. Members of the Post staff said Mrs. Schiff had learned in May that she had cancer and had decided against being treated for it. Mrs. Schiff, the granddaughter of a wealthy investment banker, used her family money to obtain the controlling stock of The Post in 1939. She sold it in 1976 to Rupert Murdoch, who sold it in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow. Under her stewardship, the newspaper alternately made and lost money, and Mrs. Schiff constantly fretted that it would drive her into pauperdom. But she always managed to keep the newspaper afloat, seeing it outlast its competitors to become the only afternoon daily in New York City. She said in 1987 that she decided to sell the paper to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian entrepreneur, after The Post incurred heavy losses in the mid-1970's. Weak Competitor in '39 Mrs. Schiff bought a controlling interest in The Post in 1939 from J. David Stern at the urging of her second husband, George Backer. She had little business experience, and she later learned that she had assumed obligations for millions of dollars in severance pay if the paper closed. Mrs. Schiff played only a peripheral role in the management of The Post in the first 10 years of her ownership. When she took active control, her new editor, James A. Wechsler, said the odds of its surviving were 1,000 to 1. Few would have challenged him. The Post was a weak third in the field of New York City afternoon dailies, behind The Journal-American and The World-Telegram, and it had been losing money for 20 years. But the Post survived and prospered, becoming a liberal power in journalism while its powerful competitors collapsed, one by one. Even her critics agreed that most of the credit had to go to Mrs. Schiff. But they also said her success was partly attributable to personality traits for which they criticized her and to which she freely confessed: a fondness for gossip and scandal, a fear of becoming poor and a craving for power or, as she called it, influence. 'Men, Money & Magic' Mrs. Schiff resumed her maiden name after her third divorce but decided that ''Mrs.'' was more appropriate than ''Miss'' for a grandmother. She described her private life in her diaries and other papers and in interviews. The book, ''Men, Money & Magic: The Story of Dorothy Schiff,'' by Jeffrey Potter, was published by Coward, McCann & Geoghegan in 1976. Much of the book is devoted to her relationships with her husbands and male friends, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who persuaded her to build a home near his in Hyde Park, N.Y. Her biography suggested that their relationship had included sex and that it had been approved by Mr. Backer. Mrs. Schiff came to regret what she called ''that awful book.'' In a statement volunteered for this obituary, she said, ''I want to make it very clear that President Roosevelt never made a suggestion that I become his girlfriend, and Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt was just as good a friend as Mr. Roosevelt.'' Born on Fifth Avenue Mrs. Schiff was born on March 11, 1903, in the Fifth Avenue apartment of her parents, Mortimer L. and Adele Neustadt Schiff. The apartment was a wedding gift from her grandfather, Jacob H. Schiff, a stern banker and the head of Kuhn, Loeb & Company. As a girl, Dorothy - known to many as Dolly - was often treated coldly by her parents, each of whom had separate romantic and social interests. ''There was no joy in my growing up,'' she recalled. ''None, absolutely none.'' Later she would explain her refusal to grant bonuses or congratulations to Post staff members for good work by saying, ''They weren't given to me as a child, and any"

He was 71. Willette Ballard, a representative for the group, said the cause was congestive heart failure. The Whispers had numerous hits and, at the height of their popularity, in the 1980s, four singles in the Billboard pop Top 40. The group's first platinum album, released in 1979, was ''The Whispers,'' which included the disco hit ''And the Beat Goes On.'' Its last big hit was the 1987 single ''Rock Steady,'' a collaboration with the producer Kenneth Edmonds, known as Babyface. Mr. Caldwell wrote a number of the Whispers' songs, including the fan favorite ''Lady.'' The Whispers were formed in Los Angeles in 1963 by the twin brothers Walter and Wallace Scott, Marcus Hutson, Gordy Harmon and Mr. Caldwell. The group's first Top 10 R&B hit was ''Seems Like I Gotta Do Wrong'' in 1970. Leaveil Degree replaced Mr. Harmon in 1971. Mr. Hutson died in 2000. The four surviving members continued to perform and record together and, according to the group's website, have concerts booked into the fall. The Whispers were inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2014."

Woititz, a best-selling author, lecturer and counselor to the troubled offspring of alcoholics, died last Thursday at her home in Roseland, N.J. She was 55. The cause was cancer, her family said. Dr. Woititz's ""Adult Children of Alcoholics"" offered insights into typical patterns in the families of alcoholics, like lack of self-esteem and difficulty relating to people. The trade paperback turned into something of a publishing phenomenon. Issued by Health Communications Inc. in 1983, the book won a grass-roots following and made best-seller lists around the country in 1986 and stayed on them for about a year. An expanded edition appeared in 1990. The book was translated into six foreign languages; the English version alone has sold 1.8 million copies. Another of her books, ""Struggle for Intimacy"" (1985), also reached best-seller lists, and has sold 900,000 copies. Doctorate from Rutgers Dr. Woititz was born in Great Neck, L.I., and graduated from Antioch College. She received an M.A. from Montclair State College, where she became an adjunct professor. Her doctorate in education was granted by Rutgers University in 1976. She taught during the summer at the Rutgers Center for Alcoholic Studies. She was the founder and president of the Institute for Counseling and Training of West Caldwell, N.J.

53159,"William H. Ginsburg, 70, Monica Lewinsky's Lawyer","William H. Ginsburg, a civil malpractice lawyer in Los Angeles whose career took a startling turn in 1998 when he went to Washington to represent, volubly and controversially, a young White House intern named Monica Lewinsky, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles.","William H. Ginsburg, a civil malpractice lawyer in Los Angeles whose career took a startling turn in 1998 when he went to Washington to represent, volubly and controversially, a young White House intern named Monica Lewinsky, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 70. The cause was cancer, his wife, Laura Yudell Ginsberg, said. Mr. Ginsburg had spent three decades practicing law in Southern California when a friend and client, Dr. Bernard Lewinsky, a radiation oncologist, asked him to help his daughter. Ms. Lewinsky, 24, was embroiled in a stunning scandal over accusations that she had had an affair with President Bill Clinton and that he had urged her to lie about it. In the five frenzied months from Mr. Ginsburg's arrival in January 1998 to his departure in early June, his public image evolved from fresh-faced truth teller in a truth-challenged town to publicity hound lacking the necessary legal skills. Mr. Ginsburg failed to secure an early plea bargain or immunity agreement with prosecutors. His public statements sometimes prompted questions about whether he had his client's best interests in mind. ''No one ever lies,'' he told one interviewer. ''People often do what they have to do to make their story sound right.'' At one point he wrote a letter to Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, accusing him of prosecutorial misconduct. ''Congratulations, Mr. Starr!'' Mr. Ginsburg wrote. ''As a result of your callous disregard for cherished constitutional rights, you may have succeeded in unmasking a sexual relationship between two consenting adults.'' That assertion appeared to threaten Ms. Lewinsky's legal position; she had denied that there was a relationship. After the letter was made public, another lawyer for Ms. Lewinsky, Nathaniel Speights, quickly asserted that ''nothing has changed'' in her position. Mr. Ginsburg once appeared on five Sunday talk shows on the same day, setting a standard sometimes referred to as ''the full Ginsburg.'' He reveled in being courted by television anchors seeking the first interview with Ms. Lewinsky, though he never delivered it. Barbara Walters won the contest, in March 1999, long after he had left the scene. He was replaced on June 2, 1998, by two lawyers with extensive Washington experience, Jacob A. Stein and Plato Cacheris. The Lewinsky family said in a statement that day that the parting was by mutual agreement, but Ms. Lewinsky later railed against Mr. Ginsburg in her memoir, saying he cared more about publicity than her case and had tried to divide her family. Supporters of Mr. Ginsburg said he had been in an impossible position, trying to protect both his client and the president, and that he deserved some credit for the fact that Ms. Lewinsky was never prosecuted. ''She was a pawn in all this, and Bill went out there and dropped everything for his friend and really put himself in the line of fire and drew it away from Monica,'' George J. Stephan, who worked with Mr. Ginsburg for 25 years, said in an interview on Wednesday. ''If I were Monica's father, I would have been very happy.'' Mr. Stephan emphasized that Mr. Ginsburg had represented Ms. Lewinsky for less than five months, and that he had been successful in many high-profile cases. Mr. Ginsburg was involved in a 1984 case in California that established a patient's right to refuse medical care. He spent many years successfully representing swimming pool manufacturers against injury claims, defended a cardiologist who had examined the Loyola Marymount University basketball player Hank Gathers shortly before he died during a game, and defended a doctor accused of concealing that Liberace had died of AIDS. William Howard Ginsburg was born on March 25, 1943, in Philadelphia. His father worked as a lawyer for Lyndon B. Johnson when he was a senator from Texas. Mr. Ginsburg graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and received his law degree from the University of Southern California in 1968. In addition to his wife, his survivors include a daughter, Sasha Gutstein; two sons, David and Maxwell; two grandchildren; his mother, Sylvia; and his brother, Kenneth Gibbs."

He was 81 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He died of a neurological disorder, his daughter, Lydia Parnes of Washington, said. Justice Bloom was first appointed to the Criminal Court bench in 1962 by Mayor Robert F. Wagner and served there until 1969, when he was elected to the State Supreme Court in the Bronx and Manhattan. In 1979, Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed him an associate justice of the Appellate Division and he remained there until his retirement in 1986.

He was 64 years old and lived in Sag Harbor, L.I. Professor Beckerman, who was dean of Columbia's School of the Arts from 1972 to 1976, blended his practical knowledge of working theater with an intellectual curiosity about drama theory. His ''Shakespeare at the Globe'' (1962) offered new insights into the theater in which the Bard presented his plays. Professor Beckerman went to Columbia in 1965 and during his years there was also chairman of the department of English and comparative literature. He also established, in the mid-1960's, the program that enabled students to receive doctoral degrees in theater at Columbia. He was born in New York and pursued his theatrical interests in drama groups at City College and later at Columbia, where he received his graduate degree. He taught at Hofstra University, where he founded the drama department, from 1947 until 1965. On that school's Long Island campus, he organized Hofstra's annual William Shakespeare Festival. He directed productions there and elsewhere, including plays done by the Equity Library Theater.

She was 61 years old. She died of breast cancer, said her husband, Dr. Girard Franklin, also a psychoanalyst. Dr. Friedman, as she was known professionally, felt it important not to hide her illness because of the effect on therapy, her husband said. When she assumed the presidency of the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Society in May 1990, she gave an address titled, ""Impact of a Therapist's Life -- Threatening Illness on the Therapeutic Situation."" The address was published last year by the magazine Contemporary Psychoanalysis. At the time of her death, Dr. Friedman was a training and supervising analyst at the William Alanson White Institute in Manhattan besides being a member of the faculty. She was to start teaching a course on women's issues in psychoanalysis next week. She was also a training and supervising analyst at the Institute for Psychotherapy, an attending psychologist at Roosevelt Hospital and a lecturer in psychiatry at Columbia University. She was particularly known for her work on mother-daughter relationships. In a study on raising children in The New York Times Magazine in March 1985, Dr. Friedman was quoted as saying: ""The cultural expectations will always be more powerful than any biological differences. From day one, a mother treats a boy baby differently from a girl baby. Cultural imprinting is so subtle that we can't help ourselves. But it's not a bad thing. We're raising them for the culture they have to live in.""

41707,"Rabbi Solomon Freehof, 97, Dies; Leading Interpreter of Jewish Law","Rabbi Solomon B. Freehof, a leader of the Reform Jewish movement and a world-renowned interpreter of Jewish law, died yesterday at Montefiore Hospital in Pittsburgh.","Rabbi Solomon B. Freehof, a leader of the Reform Jewish movement and a world-renowned interpreter of Jewish law, died yesterday at Montefiore Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 97 years old. Dr. Freehof, who lived in Pittsburgh, was rabbi emeritus of Rodef Shalom Temple, that city's leading Reform Jewish congregation, which he headed from 1934 to 1966. He returned to the pulpit there on occasion to preach at the High Holy Days or on the anniversary of his bar mitzvah. Until recently he made periodic visits to the temple to work in the library. A rabbi for 75 years, he was Reform Jewry's designated expert on responsa, or interpretation of Jewish religious laws. For many years he provided Reform Jews with answers to questions on how they should observe Jewish teachings. His role was to free Reform Jews from strictures of rabbinic law but at the same time to help them remain faithful to Jewish teachings. Blending Freedom and Loyalty ''I'm struggling for a philosophy which will allow us to have a kinship with the greatness of the Jewish spirit,'' he said in an interview in 1975. ''The problem is how to have loyalty and freedom - and it's a problem. The purpose of my responsa is not governance, but guidance.'' In 1959, he became the first American elected president of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, the international organization of Reform Jews. He held the post until 1964. He also served as president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis and served with the Commission on Jewish Education for Reform Judaism and the National Jewish Welfare Board. Dr. Freehof began his interpretations of Jewish law in World War II, when he headed a committee of Jewish chaplains. With Jewish soldiers stationed in Iceland, where night lasted six months, when was sunset? His decision was that it would be the same time as in New York. Born in London on Aug. 8, 1892, Dr. Freehof came to the United States when he was 11 years old. The family first lived in Baltimore, where he received his primary and secondary education. He later moved to Cincinnati, where he attended the University of Cincinnati, while attending Hebrew Union College. He was ordained a rabbi in 1915 at the age of 22. He then taught at Hebrew Union for several years and served as a chaplain with the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe in World War I. Afterward, he became rabbi of Kehillath Anshe Mayriv Temple in Chicago and in 1934, he married Lillian Simon, who had been his secretary and was an author of children's books His library contained thousands of volumes, including one of the world's greatest collections on Jewish law. He did his own bookbinding. A Prolific Author He was a prolific author who wrote hundreds of articles, a series of book reviews and more than a score of books on Jewish law, including ''Stormers of Heaven,'' ''The Responsa Literature,'' ''Book of Job'' and ''Preface to Scripture.'' For years he spoke on radio on one of his favorite subjects, Shakespeare. He was also in demand as a lecturer. Even before the days of television he expressed concern for young people, warning of the excesses that could come from radio and films. ''There is little that religion can do to influence them except to try and hold radio and movies to standards of decency,'' he said. He is survived by his wife and several nieces and nephews."
52282,at 103,"Edward L. Bernays, an early leader in the public relations field who devised or developed many techniques for influencing public opinion, died yesterday at his home in Cambridge, Mass.","Edward L. Bernays, an early leader in the public relations field who devised or developed many techniques for influencing public opinion, died yesterday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 103. Mr. Bernays was one of the first people to expand what had been a narrow concept of press agentry, or working to influence government policy, into a far more ambitious -- and controversial -- realm of seeking to influence and change public opinion and behavior. Over the years, he was instrumental in the formation of opinion-shaping methods that were used on behalf of many business and industrial enterprises, welfare and civic groups, and governments at home and abroad. He helped shape public relations by favoring the use of endorsements from opinion leaders, celebrities, doctors and other ""experts"" to strengthen the arguments his clients wanted to make. In addition, he favored surveys, releasing the results of experiments and polls to make a better case for his clients' positions and products. Mr. Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, was born in Vienna, grew up in New York and made the city his longtime home and base for his public relations work. Doris E. Fleischman was his wife and partner for more than 50 years. They began working together in 1919, were married in 1922 and moved to Cambridge in 1962. She died in 1980. Several of the societal changes that Mr. Bernays espoused for clients have had long-lasting effects. For instance, he was instrumental in making it acceptable for women to smoke in public, sponsoring, on behalf of the American Tobacco Company's Lucky Strike cigarettes, demonstrations in which debutantes gathered on street corners to light up. The cigarettes were even called ""torches of freedom."" On behalf of Lucky Strike, Mr. Bernays also undertook to alter women's fashions. When surveys showed that women objected to Luckies because the green package with its red bull's-eye clashed with the colors of their clothes, he swung into action to make green fashionable. There followed a green fashion luncheon, green balls (at which green gowns were worn), and window displays of green suits and dresses. The campaign was a brilliant success, according to sales figures. He regarded himself as a professional opinion maker who, by following precise principles, could produce desired changes in attitudes. ""Public relations, effectively used, helps validate an underlying principle of our society -- competition in the market place of ideas and things,"" he wrote in 1971. But in an interview in 1991, when he turned 100, he said: ""Public relations today is horrible. Any dope, any nitwit, any idiot can call him or herself a public relations practitioner."" He said he was still consulting with clients and regarded public relations loftily as a ""social science."" By the 1990's, his niche in cultural history seemed assured. In 1995, Ann Douglas, a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University, wrote in ""Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in the 1920's"" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux) that in that era, ""Freud was the chosen mentor of Madison Avenue,"" and ""Edward Bernays, often called the 'father of public relations,' who orchestrated the commercialization of a culture, was Freud's nephew and a self-conscious popularizer of his thought."" One of his early public relations strokes was on behalf of Venida hairnets. When women began to bob their hair after World War I, they discarded hairnets, much to the distress of hairnet manufacturers. Venida, an industry leader, called in Mr. Bernays, who conducted a public relations campaign for the product. Among other things, he got artists to praise the ""Greek coiffure"" look that hairnets gave their wearers. And he got a labor expert to urge labor commissioners around the country to insist that women working with or near machines wear hairnets for their own protection. Much favorable publicity ensued. In this, as in similar campaigns, Mr. Bernays's approach was oblique. The emphasis was on hairnets, not on Venida. Indeed, Venida was rarely mentioned at all. Born on Nov. 22, 1891, Mr. Bernays was one of five children of Ely Bernays and Anna Freud Bernays. The family moved in 1892 to the United States, and in 1912 Mr. Bernays graduated from Cornell University. After doing United States Government war propaganda work in World War I, Mr. Bernays realized that, as he put it in the 1991 interview, ""if this could be used for war, it can be used for peace."" And so he opened his office with his wife-to-be and in a short time accumulated an impressive array of clients, among them the Hotel Association of New York City; the Waldorf-Astoria; Procter & Gamble Company; the Celanese Corporation; Continental Baking Company; General Electric Company; General Motors Corporation; Philco; United Fruit Company; Westinghouse Electric Corporation; Time Inc.; CBS, and NBC. He also handled publicity for Clare Boothe Luce and Samuel Goldwyn. Some of Mr. Bernays's promotion efforts became legendary. To promote Ivory soap and make bathing more popular with children, he set up a national small-sculpture panel that for years oversaw soap-carving competitions. In his later years, beginning in the early 1960's, he was a public opponent of smoking and took part in anti-smoking campaigns. Around his 100th birthday, he campaigned unsuccessfully to get legislation passed in Massachusetts and other states that would have required the licensing of public-relations practitioners. His books include ""Biography of an Idea: Memoirs of Public Relations Counsel Edward L.

19864,"Dennis deLeon, 61, Dies; Led Rights Panel in City","Dennis deLeon, a former New York City human rights commissioner who was one of the first city officials to announce that he was infected with the virus that causes AIDS and who later led one of the nation's most influential advocacy groups for Latinos with AIDS, died Monday in Manhattan.","Dennis deLeon, a former New York City human rights commissioner who was one of the first city officials to announce that he was infected with the virus that causes AIDS and who later led one of the nation's most influential advocacy groups for Latinos with AIDS, died Monday in Manhattan. He was 61. The cause was heart failure, said Bruce Kiernan, Mr. deLeon's companion for 32 years. Mr. deLeon learned he was H.I.V.-positive in 1986 and had grown weaker in recent years, Mr. Kiernan said. Mr. deLeon had been human rights commissioner for three years when he disclosed his condition in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times in 1993. At the time, AIDS bore far more of a stigma than it does today, and he said he had been struggling about whether to go public. ''When I contemplated disclosure,'' he wrote, ''I felt that my hope to continue contributing to society as a lawyer and human rights activist was threatened. Would I be evaluated on my merits if I sought to be a judge, a law professor, a law firm member or a governmental appointee?'' In his article, Mr. deLeon commended two other officials -- Thomas K. Duane, then a City Council member and now a state senator, and Ronald Johnson, the city's AIDS services coordinator at the time -- for previously disclosing their H.I.V.-positive status. Until then, Mr. deLeon said, only his mother, his partner and Mayor David N. Dinkins had been aware of the situation. As commissioner, he had seen hundreds of cases in which H.I.V.-positive New Yorkers were shunned by colleagues and employers, he wrote. ''Often, the person is transferred into a meaningless position, passed over for advancement or fired,'' he added. ''Such treatment is often made to appear superficially legitimate but is frequently revealed through investigation to be based on discrimination. Why should I put up with this?'' He would not. A year later, Mr. deLeon became president of the Latino Commission on AIDS, an organization that had a staff of two. It now has a staff of 45 and a budget of $5 million and works in partnership with 380 organizations around the county. Mr. deLeon was its president until a few months ago. Under his leadership, the organization created a national Spanish-language clearinghouse for AIDS information, a network of prevention programs in Spanish-speaking churches, and committees with the mission of mobilizing gay Latinos as well as immigrants, women and inmates with AIDS. In 2003, the organization sponsored the first National Latino AIDS Awareness Day, a program that is now held annually on Oct. 15 in 40 states. Dennis Lawrence deLeon was born in Los Angeles on July 16, 1948, one of two children of Jess and Josephine Munoz deLeon, who were of Mexican descent. His father was a schoolteacher. Besides Mr. Kiernan, his partner, Mr. deLeon, who lived in Manhattan, is survived by his father; his sister, Diane Walden; his stepmother, Louise deLeon; a half brother, Dan; and a half sister, Denise. After graduating from Occidental College in 1970, Mr. deLeon received his law degree from Stanford in 1974. He later became a trial lawyer for the Department of Justice in Washington, then returned to his home state to work for California Rural Legal Assistance, helping migrant workers. Mr. deLeon's human rights work came to the attention of Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., New York City's corporation counsel, and in 1982, at his recommendation, Mayor Edward I. Koch named Mr. deLeon senior assistant corporation counsel. Four years later, Mr. Dinkins, then the Manhattan borough president, appointed Mr. deLeon deputy borough president. After Mr. Dinkins became mayor in 1990, he named Mr. deLeon human rights commissioner. It was a time of heightened ethnic tension in the city. As commissioner, Mr. deLeon worked to calm disputes between blacks and Orthodox Jews in Crown Heights and Williamsburg, Brooklyn; blacks and Korean grocery owners in Flatbush, Brooklyn; and Dominicans and the police in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. In 1992, after two black children were attacked by four white men in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx -- they were robbed and their faces were sprayed with a white liquid -- Mr. deLeon sent in one of the Bias Response Teams he had created two years earlier. Under Mr. deLeon, a human rights commission study found that many hospitals and clinics in the city were refusing to perform abortions on women infected with the AIDS virus. Investigators posing as patients made appointments at 50 health centers but were turned away from 20 clinics when they said they were H.I.V.-positive. ''To have this service denied to these women is really a crime,'' Mr. deLeon said. ''No one wants to deal with these folks. We're sending a message to the clinics that this is illegal, and we will pursue you.''"

She was 22. Ms. Keegan was riding in a car driven by her boyfriend, Michael Gocksch, a fellow Yale graduate, when it rolled over. She was pronounced dead at the scene; Mr. Gocksch was not seriously injured. Ms. Keegan was to start working as an assistant at The New Yorker magazine in June. A musical she wrote with two other students, ''Independents,'' is to be performed at the New York International Fringe Festival this summer. At Yale, Ms. Keegan helped organize a protest challenging campus recruiting, known as Occupy Morgan Stanley. Students gathered outside the hotel where Morgan Stanley was holding an information session, chanting slogans like ''Take a stance, don't go into finance.'' Ms. Keegan expressed a similar view in a column she wrote for DealBook on The New York Times Web site. The column, which followed an article she wrote for The Yale Daily News, tapped into a national debate about the financial services industry. ''Maybe I'm overly optimistic, but I think most young, ambitious people want to have a positive impact on the world. Whether it's through art or activism or advances in science, almost every student I spoke to had some kind of larger, altruistic goal in life,'' she wrote. ''But what I heard again and again was that working at JPMorgan or Bain or Morgan Stanley was the best way to prepare oneself for a future doing public good,'' she continued. ''Why do students believe this? Because the recruiters tell them it's true. Personally, I think it's ridiculous. Those skills can be gained elsewhere.'' Marina Evelyn Keegan was born Oct. 25, 1989, in Wayland, Mass., where her family lives. Survivors include her parents, Tracy and Kevin, and two brothers, Trevor and Pierce."

35105,"Mike Lynn, 76, Vikings' General Manager","Mike Lynn, who as general manager helped the Minnesota Vikings reach the Super Bowl and who orchestrated what proved to be one of the worst trades in N.F.L.","Mike Lynn, who as general manager helped the Minnesota Vikings reach the Super Bowl and who orchestrated what proved to be one of the worst trades in N.F.L. history, died on Saturday. He was 76. His death was confirmed by a representative for the Vikings. As general manager from 1975 to 1990, arriving the same year the Vikings were defeated in the Super Bowl by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mr. Lynn helped Minnesota win seven N.F.C. Central Division titles and reach Super Bowl XI, which they lost to the Oakland Raiders at the Rose Bowl on Jan. 9, 1977. He was also instrumental in the Vikings' move to the Metrodome in 1982. But his accomplishments were tarnished by a 1989 midseason trade with the Dallas Cowboys for running back Herschel Walker, the 1982 Heisman Trophy winner. Mr. Lynn, who thought a powerhouse back was crucial for his team to win the Super Bowl, pursued the trade despite the objections of the Vikings' coach, Jerry Burns. The Vikings gave up five players, two of them All-Pros, and a half-dozen draft picks over three years, including three in the first round. Walker proved a disappointment that season, scoring only six touchdowns in the remaining 11 games, and the Vikings lost the division to the San Francisco 49ers. Walker was released in 1992 after two more disappointing seasons. The Cowboys used their draft picks to rebuild what was the N.F.L.'s worst team into the winners of the Super Bowls played in 1993, 1994 and 1996. The Vikings have not won a Super Bowl in four appearances and have not been back to one since 1977. ''I gave up too much,'' Mr. Lynn told The New York Times in 1992. After he left the Vikings in 1990, Mr. Lynn became president of the World League of American Football, which went on hiatus after two seasons and was reborn as N.F.L. Europe. (It was dissolved in 2007.) In 1995, he tried to start a sponsor-owned league with CBS, but it also fizzled. Michael Lynn was born on May 18, 1936, in Scranton, Pa. He dropped out of college to work at a Dixie-Mart and manage a movie theater in Memphis. He wrote a letter that caught the eye of Max Winter, owner of the Vikings, and started working as his assistant in 1974. Mr. Winter was a mentor, and promoted Mr. Lynn rapidly: in June 1975, he was named general manager. Mr. Lynn and his wife, Jorja, had four children. Information on survivors was not available. Although Mr. Lynn eventually sold his Vikings stock, he never stopped making money off the team. A 1979 contract with the Vikings guarantees him and his heirs 10 percent of luxury suite revenue at the Metrodome until the team moves to a new stadium. The arrangement has paid him $14 million to $20 million since it took effect in 1982. The Vikings recently announced plans to build a $975 million stadium by 2016."
891,"Alvin Bunis, 87, Creator Of a Senior Tennis Circuit","Before Alvin Bunis came along, a professional tennis player's career seldom lasted past his early 30s.","Before Alvin Bunis came along, a professional tennis player's career seldom lasted past his early 30s. But Bunis (pronounced BUN-iss) believed that people would pay to see champions like Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall and Don Budge compete even after their prime years were behind them. So he created the Tennis Grand Masters circuit, for players over 45. At its peak in the late 1970s, the circuit drew thousands of fans in more than 25 countries, attracting many of the greatest names in professional tennis. Bunis, an avid amateur player who started organizing tournaments in 1972, died on Aug. 26 in Cincinnati. He was 87. The cause was complications of a stroke, his son, Alvin Jr., said. Bunis was drawn to senior tennis because, as he told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2003, ''it's one of the few mainstream sports where you can see players play close enough to how they played at the height of their careers.'' The tournaments were usually played over a weekend and featured eight-man draws of former superstars, and prize money was awarded. Bunis sold Tennis Grand Masters to International Management Group in 1981. Tennis Grand Masters stopped holding events a few years later, and he founded the World Senior Tennis Open. These days competitive senior tennis in the United States is played in exhibition matches. Bunis's senior tour predated its counterpart in pro golf, the Senior PGA Tour (now the Champions Tour), established in 1980. Bunis later wrote on senior tennis for Tennis Magazine and, with Roger Williams, wrote ''How to Play Winning Tennis in the Prime of Life'' (1983). Alvin Woodrow Bunis was born in New York City on Feb. 2, 1924. He learned to play tennis as a boy and became one of the top players in Cincinnati after he moved there as a teenager. He was a singles semifinalist and a doubles champion at the Tri-State Tennis Tournament in Ohio in 1943 before serving in the Navy during World War II. After the war, Bunis developed a scrap metal brokerage and industrial waste control company. He played men's singles at Forest Hills, Queens, in the national championships, which became the United States Open. In 1950, he married Ann Johnston, who survives him. In 1970, Bunis played senior doubles at Wimbledon. In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by another son, Henry; a daughter, Catherine McDonough; and seven grandchildren. A third son, William, died before him."
18764,"Lyman Wynne, 83, a Leader in Research on Mental Illnesses","Dr. Lyman C. Wynne, a psychiatrist and psychologist whose research helped lay the foundation for family-based therapies for mental disorders, died on Jan. 17 in Bethesda, Md.","Dr. Lyman C. Wynne, a psychiatrist and psychologist whose research helped lay the foundation for family-based therapies for mental disorders, died on Jan. 17 in Bethesda, Md. He was 83. The cause was cancer, his daughter Christine Wynne said. Dr. Wynne's studies of families coping with mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, prompted therapists to include family members as allies in treatment plans when possible, and also clarified the understanding of how genetics influences mental disorders' progression. His research was ''essential to debunking the blaming notion that a child's early family environment, particularly the mother, causes schizophrenia,'' said Dr. Eric D. Caine, chairman of the psychiatry department at the University of Rochester, where Dr. Wynne was a professor for more than 20 years. In recent years Dr. Wynne, with Dr. Pekka Tienari, Dr. Karl-Erik Wahlberg and others, published findings from a landmark study of Finnish adoptees at risk of developing schizophrenia, demonstrating that stressful social environments can increase the likelihood that genetically vulnerable people will develop the disorder. ''His main contribution was to use social environment as a support and help in treatment of severe disorders,'' said Susan H. McDaniel, director of the Wynne Center for Family Research, based at the University of Rochester and founded and financed by Dr. Wynne's family. Dr. Wynne was born Lyman Carroll Wind in Tyler, Minn., on Sept. 17, 1923, to a struggling farming couple. He moved to Duluth at 12 and lived with relatives through high school. He won a scholarship to Harvard and graduated with a medical degree in psychiatry. While at Harvard he changed his surname to Wynne, and married Adele Rogerson. He later earned a doctorate in social psychology, and worked during the 1950s and '60s at the National Institute of Mental Health, in Bethesda. Dr. Wynne trained as a psychoanalyst during his time at the institute, and his work -- together with that of other theorists working independently -- helped establish family therapy approaches. Dr. Wynne is survived by five children, Christine Wynne of Lake Oswego, Ore.; Randy Wynne of Tampa, Fla.; Sara Wynne of Oakland, Calif.; Barry Wind of Bethesda; and Jonathan Wynne of Brooklyn; a sister, Nadine Tornquist of Minneapolis; and five grandchildren. He had his own family therapy practice for much of his career, and his wife joined him as a therapist when their children were grown. She died in 2003."
2956,"Robert A. Scalapino, 92, A Scholar of Asian Politics","Robert A. Scalapino, an eminent scholar of Asian politics who achieved prominence during the Vietnam War for his strong defense of American policy as opposition to it was growing, died Nov. 1 in Oakland, Calif.","Robert A. Scalapino, an eminent scholar of Asian politics who achieved prominence during the Vietnam War for his strong defense of American policy as opposition to it was growing, died Nov. 1 in Oakland, Calif. He was 92. The cause was complications of a respiratory infection, the University of California, Berkeley, said. Professor Scalapino taught there from 1949 to 1990 and founded its Institute of East Asian Studies in 1978. The author of 39 books on Vietnam, China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan, Professor Scalapino was also editor of Asian Survey, a scholarly publication, from 1962 to 1996 and advised the State Department and other government agencies. In 1965, he wound up arguing the Johnson administration's case for escalating the war at what was billed as a national teach-in on Vietnam policy. The event was a debate by a panel before an audience of 5,000 in Washington and more than 100,000 people at more than 100 campuses who had gathered to hear the debate by radio hookups. McGeorge Bundy, the national security adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson, had been scheduled to attend, and many participants had hoped to hear his pro-war views and confront him. When he canceled at the last minute, it fell to Professor Scalapino, who had also been invited to join the panel, to take the lead in defending the White House's policy. He argued that the United States was fighting communism, not Asian nationalism, and that China would regard the United States as a ''paper tiger'' if it abandoned the war. He continued to make that argument the following year in a long article in The New York Times Magazine. He wrote that the war tested ''the American capacity to respond to a threat that is important but not terminal.'' His pro-war views were disputed by some academics. In 1967, after he helped write a report with 13 other scholars arguing that the war's prosecution was a ''moderate'' course, four professors at the University of Pennsylvania wrote a letter to The Times saying that ''destroying a small country'' was immoral. Robert Anthony Scalapino was born Oct. 19, 1919, in Leavenworth, Kan., and spent his teens in Santa Barbara, Calif., where his father taught school. He studied politics, focusing on relations between the United States and Europe, at what is now the University of California, Santa Barbara, graduating in 1940. He earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. from Harvard. His interest in Asia was sparked when he was trained in the Japanese language as a Navy officer in World War II. Professor Scalapino became an influential analyst of the Japanese political system. He called it a ''one-and-a-half party'' system in which the dominant Liberal Democrats maneuvered with minority parties to govern. His description of present-day China as an ''authoritarian-pluralist society,'' one that allows limited rights but not democracy, was widely quoted. In the mid-1970s, John K. Fairbank, the eminent sinologist, called Professor Scalapino ''a leader in the Asian revolution in American thinking.'' Professor Scalapino advised secretaries of state, advocating closer relations with China years before President Richard M. Nixon's historic 1972 visit, and condemning ''flagrant'' human rights abuses in Taiwan in the 1960s. In 2002, he worked behind the scenes to arrange for a group of American experts on Korea to visit North Korea. The trip was canceled after President George W. Bush included North Korea in what he called ''the axis of evil.'' Last year, the National Bureau of Asian Research and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars created the Scalapino Prize, to be awarded to an outstanding American scholar on Asia. His wife of 64 years, the former Dee Jessen, died in 2005, and their daughter Leslie Scalapino died last year. He is survived by his daughters Diane Jablon and Lynne Scalapino; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Professor Scalapino visited the People's Republic of China 62 times, the last when he was 88. He went to Tibet and, with the aid of an oxygen container, rode a yak up a mountain to a Buddhist monastery."

Degnan, an advertising executive who helped guide the sport of competitive croquet through a period of extraordinary growth in the late 1980's and early 1990's, died on Aug. 7 while on a business trip to New Orleans. He was 76 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla., and Westhampton Beach, N.Y. The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Connie Merlino. Before Mr. Degnan promoted the sport, there were only dozens of clubs in America where competitive croquet -- as opposed to recreational croquet -- could be played. But after his tenure as a leader of the United States Croquet Association and the United States Croquet Foundation, there are now about 250 croquet clubs and about 5,000 players registered with the association. The competitive sport is distinguished by strict adherence to rules, handicapping, national ranking and standardized equipment including a 105-foot-by-84-foot court. The prizes are slim -- rarely more than $5,000 for winning a major tournament. The game was avidly played on the East Coast in the 1920's by members of the Algonquin Round Table such as George S. Kaufman and Alexander Woollcott and on the West Coast by entertainment celebrities like Harpo Marx and Samuel Goldwyn -- all of whom are in the Croquet Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I. ""Now, after a spurt in the 1980's, the number of clubs is on the increase again,"" said Anne Robinson, secretary of the association. In drumming up interest in the sport, Mr. Degnan, a World War II fighter pilot, would tell beginners that he had nerves of steel on flying missions with the Flying Tigers over Burma, China and India, but that he could be a nervous wreck when faced with a hard-to-reach wicket. He also compared croquet with the dog-eat-dog world of advertising in which he earned his living. ""It's me against you,"" he would say. ""You have to work out your strategy and decide whether to play offensively or defensively."" Although he was a fine golfer, Degnan described croquet as more challenging because it ""involves less distance and more precision."" Mr. Degnan became attracted to the game in the mid-1970's. Ten years later, he was ranked as the sixth top player in the nation. In 1992, Mr. Degnan was inducted into the Croquet Hall of Fame in recognition of both his skill as a player and as a promoter and planner of tournaments. Mr. Degnan was a member of the Palm Beach Croquet Club and the Westhampton Beach Mallet Club. From 1994 to 1995, he was president of the foundation, a fund-raising organization he also served for 20 years as vice president and board member. And from 1984 to 1991, he was a vice president of the U.S.C.A., which arranges tournaments, membership, rules and other aspects of the game. Most of the croquet clubs in the United States are in warm-climate states like Florida, Texas and Arizona. The association says the average age of competitive players is 45. Croquet is one of the few competitive sports that does not separate players based on their age and sex. The United States National Croquet Championship to be held at the Meadow Club in Southampton, N.Y., from Sept. 27 to Oct. 3, has registered players from teen-agers to those in their 70's. The game is not cheap. A regulation court, or putting green, on which the game is played may cost between $30,000 and $50,000 to build. Donald Eugene Degnan was born in New York City on Nov. 18, 1922. He was attending Notre Dame when World War II began. He left college and joined the Flying Tigers, the band of daring volunteer American aviators who scored victories against the Japanese. After the war, Mr. Degnan returned to Notre Dame and graduated in 1946. In 1955, he founded the advertising firm of Donald Degnan Associates. In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Lissa Degnan of Denville, N.J., and Diana Degnan Thorson of Miami. Croquet wasn't Mr. Degnan's only passion. He worked hard to keep the memories of the Flying Tigers alive as vice president of the P-40 Pilots Association and as a member of the P-51 Pilots Association and the Hump Pilots Association. http://www.nytimes.com"

He was 89. His death was confirmed by his daughter Kristen Welch. In 1970, as the director of archaeology at Colonial Williamsburg, Mr. Nol Hume was searching in the ruins of Carter's Grove, a nearby 17th-century plantation along the James River, when he and his colleagues discovered the remains of a once-fortified settlement called Wolstenholme Towne. The site was founded in 1619 by 220 men and women who had arrived on the vessel Gift of God to establish a plantation for the Virginia Company of London. The settlement, named for John Wolstenholme, a prominent company shareholder, was about nine miles downstream from Jamestown, where colonists had first landed 12 years before. More settlers arrived in the succeeding months, but within three years, Wolstenholme had all but disappeared. In 1622, Indians, who had controlled the Tidewater area before the colonists arrived, attacked settlers in their homes and fields, leaving as many as 400 English dead. Afterward, most of the remaining outlying colonists in the area retreated to the safety of Jamestown. Mr. Nol Hume not only verified the massacre by exhuming the bones of its victims, he also found physical evidence of colonization that had largely eluded archaeologists at Jamestown, where the swampy ground had swallowed perishable artifacts and where sophisticated excavations did not begin until a generation later. Henry M. Miller, a historical researcher, wrote in The Public Historian in 2011, ''This plantation complex, largely destroyed in the 1622 Algonquin Indian uprising, yielded valuable insights about the first decades of English settlement in America and provided key evidence later used to help interpret Jamestown.'' As the head of archaeology at Williamsburg and an author of ultimately more than two dozen books, Mr. Nol Hume endowed the unvarnished artifacts he unearthed with a social and economic perspective. The newspaper Antiques and the Arts Weekly recently credited his books, lectures and television presentations with propelling the field of historical archaeology ''to the forefront of his profession.'' Reviewing his book ''The Virginia Adventure,'' the historian Arthur Quinn wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1994 that Mr. Nol Hume ''will charm the mute artifacts into speaking about subjects on which the written record has preferred to remain silent.'' ''He is now unquestionably the foremost colonial archaeologist of his generation,'' Professor Quinn concluded. Mr. Nol Hume, who had been fascinated by artifacts since he received a gift of ancient Greek coins as a child but who did not have a degree in archaeology, proudly considered himself to be a historical detective. ''Historical archaeology,'' he wrote, ''simply means hunting for physical evidence and reviewing it alongside the testimony of people who knew or saw what happened.'' As director of Colonial Williamsburg's archaeological mission from 1957 to 1988, he had to reconcile competing agendas. The architects who oversaw the early excavations were mainly interested in unearthing the colonial capital's original brick foundations so that they could faithfully recreate its buildings. Most of the artifacts they dug up were neither recorded nor preserved. ''The archaeology being done at Colonial Williamsburg was atrocious,'' Mr. Nol Hume said in a 2012 video interview with Cinebar Productions, which produces documentaries for museums and nonprofit organizations. [Video: Ivor Noel Hume Reflections on a Life Well Lived Watch on YouTube.] He also confronted another professional quandary: whether to exhibit the objects he uncovered as they were, or to gussy them up for popular consumption at Williamsburg, which had become a tourist attraction. He initially came down on the side of raw authenticity. ''History became more important than beauty,'' he recalled. ''Reality became the thing. I was one of the people who pushed for that. ''Looking back, I wish I hadn't,'' he continued. ''It wasn't that I was wrong. My own feeling was that Colonial Williamsburg was a place to come, and, as one person said, it was a place to recharge their patriotic batteries, and that's what it was.'' Ivor Nol Hume (known as Nol) was born on Nov. 4, 1927, in London to Cecil Nol Hume, who represented an American bank in Europe, and the former Gladys Mary Bagshaw Mann. He was raised largely by servants in an aristocratic household. He was evacuated from London during World War II and studied at Framlingham and St. Lawrence Colleges. He served briefly in the Army until he was injured in an accident. Hoping to become a playwright, he was hired as a stage manager in London. After hearing a radio report about a man who fished antiquities from the Thames, he followed suit -- but what he found was mostly counterfeit coins, which he cashed in for meal money. He delivered his other finds to Adrian Oswald, the head of the Guildhall Museum, and began working with him, doing postwar archaeology in the rubble of London. Mr. Oswald offered Mr. Nol Hume a job at the museum in 1949; a week later, he found himself in charge after his boss contracted pneumonia and never returned to work. ''I came into archaeology through the back door,'' he once said. He decided to specialize in 17th- and 18th-century wine bottles -- mainly because no one else had -- and when Colonial Williamsburg came calling for an expert, he was hired. ''I had never heard of Williamsburg,'' he recalled. ''I thought American history began at Plymouth.'' He would spend the rest of his life in the area, excavating other sites and discovering what he hailed as ''the birthplace of American science'': remnants of Thomas Harriot's laboratory on Roanoke Island, N.C., set up by metallurgists in the late 16th century to test mineral samples for gold. Mr. Nol Hume's first wife, the former Audrey Baines, a fellow archaeologist with whom he worked, died in 1993. In addition to his daughter Kristen, he is survived by his second wife, the former Carol Grazier, and their sons, Michael and David Grazier; their daughter, Andrea Zecca; nine grandchildren; and a brother, David. Mr. Nol Hume's books include ''A Guide to Artifacts of Colonial America'' (1969), ''All the Best Rubbish'' (1974) and an autobiography, ''A Passion for the Past: The Odyssey of a Transatlantic Archaeologist'' (2010). He was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1993 for his service to British cultural interests in Virginia. Mr. Nol Hume approached archaeology with wonderment and imagination, much like the playwright he aspired to be. ''What will you find next?'' he said. ''What will it mean, how will it fit into the story that you're trying to recreate?'' ''People ask me, 'What is the most exciting thing you ever found?' And I usually reply, rather glibly: 'The last thing. Because one leads to another.'''"
17288,"Dr. Philip Majerus, Who Discerned Aspirin's Heart Benefits, Dies at 79","Dr. Majerus is credited with recognizing that small doses of aspirin taken daily can help to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Philip W. Majerus, a biochemist who was credited as being the first to theorize that taking small doses of aspirin regularly can prevent heart attacks and strokes in vulnerable patients, died on June 8 at his home in St. Louis.","Dr. Majerus is credited with recognizing that small doses of aspirin taken daily can help to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Philip W. Majerus, a biochemist who was credited as being the first to theorize that taking small doses of aspirin regularly can prevent heart attacks and strokes in vulnerable patients, died on June 8 at his home in St. Louis. He was 79. The cause was prostate cancer, his wife, Dr. Elaine Majerus, said. He had taught at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis for almost 50 years. Even before his findings were confirmed in a study by other researchers a decade later, Dr. Majerus was taking aspirin daily. ""I was already convinced that aspirin prevented heart attacks,"" he recalled in the journal Advances in Biological Regulation in 2014. ""I was unwilling to be randomized into a trial where I might end up with the placebo. I refused to participate."" Dr. Majerus recommended that ""all adults should take an aspirin daily unless they are among the few percent of the population that cannot tolerate the drug."" The cardiovascular benefit of aspirin was fully achieved by 50 to 75 milligrams daily, he said, and ""there is no evidence that branded aspirin, which is much more expensive, is in any way superior to the generic version."" Later studies found that for people in their 50s who are vulnerable to heart disease, taking daily doses of aspirin reduces the risk of heart disease. In 1998, Dr. Majerus received the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Cardiovascular Metabolic Research for his findings, which were credited with saving countless lives. When he received the award, Circulation, the journal of the American Heart Association, said it was Dr. Majerus who ""first proposed that low-dose aspirin could be used to treat people at risk of heart attack, stroke and other ailments associated with blood clots."" He later theorized that aspirin could also be effective in preventing some forms of cancer, pointing the way to recent studies indicating that daily doses of aspirin also reduces the risk of colon cancer. Philip Warren Majerus was born in Chicago on July 10, 1936, the son of Clarence Majerus, a manufacturer who owned a five-and-dime store in Quincy, Ill., and the former Helen Mathis. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1958, graduated from Washington University School of Medicine and did postdoctoral training at the National Institutes of Health. He joined the Washington University faculty in 1966 and retired in 2014 as a professor of medicine and biochemistry and molecular biophysics. ""I got my start in biochemistry because of the Vietnam War,"" he recalled in The Journal of Biological Chemistry. ""As I was finishing my medical residency at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1963, I had two choices going forward: Either I could go to Vietnam as a physician, or I could become a research associate in the United States Public Health Service at the National Institutes of Health. The choice was easy."" As early as the 1950s, studies had demonstrated that aspirin reduced clotting; one California doctor, Lawrence Craven, reported that he had prescribed daily doses to thousands of patients without ""a single case of detectable coronary or cerebral thrombosis."" In the 1970s, Dr. Majerus and his postdoctoral research fellow, Gerald Roth, focused on the impact of aspirin on platelets, small cells that precipitate clotting when a blood vessel is injured. They clump together and a clot forms and seals the wound. ""Late one afternoon, I looked in the St. Louis phone directory for aspirin and found a company in town, Rexall, that made aspirin tablets,"" Dr. Majerus recalled in 1978. ""I called after hours, and a man answered the phone. I explained what I wanted: 100 bottles of 100 tablets containing 160 MG aspirin and the same number of bottles of a matched placebo. The man said he could make them without any problem, and he delivered them to my lab the next morning at no charge."" He studied patients who were being treated for kidney failure and, to facilitate dialysis, had shunts, which can cause clotting, inserted in their arms. After six months, 18 of the 25 patients who were taking a placebo developed a blood clot, compared with six of the 19 who were given aspirin. Investigating how aspirin inhibited clotting, Dr. Majerus concluded that the medicine modified an enzyme that leads to the formation of a platelet-made molecule that constricts blood vessels and aggregates platelets. The pills' effect lasts for the platelets' life span, typically about two weeks. ""Phil Majerus, more than any other individual, has produced the most original body of work on biochemistry of platelets as it relates to thrombosis,"" Prof. Joseph L. Goldstein, a Nobel laureate at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said when the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award was announced. Harvey Weiss and John Vane were among the other scientists who pioneered research into the efficacy of aspirin in preventing heart attacks. Dr. David Sackett, who died last year, conducted clinical trials that confirmed their findings as he developed what became known as evidence-based medicine. Dr. Majerus's first marriage, to the former Janet Brakensiek, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, the former Elaine Flansburg, he is survived by three daughters and a son from his first marriage - Suzanne Thompson, Mary Juliet Del Valle, Mary Karen Majerus, and David Majerus - four grandchildren and two sisters, Diane Brewer and Kathy Burke."
16092,"Chandraswamy, 66, Guru Acquitted in Fraud, Dies","Chandraswamy, a Hindu holy man who counseled such 1980s glitterati as Elizabeth Taylor, the Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and the Sultan of Brunei before coming under a barrage of criminal investigations, died here on May 23.","NEW DELHI -- Chandraswamy, a Hindu holy man who counseled such 1980s glitterati as Elizabeth Taylor, the Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and the Sultan of Brunei before coming under a barrage of criminal investigations, died here on May 23. He was 66. A spokesman for Apollo Hospital said Chandraswamy had a stroke recently and died there. Born Nemi Chand Jain, the son of a Rajasthani moneylender, Chandraswamy left home to study astrology and meditation, only to emerge a few years later as a ''guru on the make,'' said Vinay Sitapati, a political scientist who interviewed him for a book. How Chandraswamy spent the intervening time was never clear. In the decades that followed, he built a vast network of political connections, most of them in the governing Indian National Congress, Mr. Sitapati said. In doing so he became an influential purveyor of information about India's power centers and of that coveted good: access. Rustic in appearance, with his wood staff and flowing beard, Chandraswamy proved skillful at winning the trust of international leaders, securing their confidence by rattling off the names of his influential confidants and performing such seemingly supernatural feats as mind reading. Often he would ask a new acquaintance to write questions on scraps of paper, crumple the scraps into balls, and then repeat each question as they unfolded the paper. ''He closed his eyes and went into a trance,'' K. Natwar Singh, a senior diplomat, wrote. ''Suddenly he asked my wife to pick up any of the paper balls. She did so. Opened it. Chandraswamy then told her what the question was. He was spot on.'' In the mid-1970s, Mr. Singh arranged a meeting between Chandraswamy and Margaret Thatcher, then the newly elected leader of Britain's Conservative Party. (She was elected prime minister in 1979.) He said he had watched her skepticism melt away as the ''godman,'' as he called him, who spoke only Hindi, guessed her scribbled questions correctly. ''By the fourth question, the future iron lady's demeanor changed,'' Mr. Singh wrote. Mrs. Thatcher was so impressed, he said, that she asked for a second appointment, and even agreed to his request that she wear a red dress. This talent, ''for entering the heads of others,'' as one journalist put it, gave Chandraswamy access to all manner of regents and superstars in a period when India's economy was beginning to tap into international networks. In her book ''Gurus: Stories of India's Leading Babas,'' the journalist Bhavdeep Kang wrote that Mobutu Sese Seko, the military dictator of Zaire, would invite Chandraswamy to Kinshasa, the capital, and ask him to hide behind a curtain during an important meeting, then ask his advice on whether the visitor could be trusted. Mr. Singh, the diplomat, recalled landing in the Bahamas and struggling fruitlessly to get an appointment with the prime minister there, only to get an unexpected call from a chuckling Chandraswamy -- who, Mr. Singh said, had not been told of his travel plans -- informing him that he had arranged a meeting between the men for the next day. Among Chandraswamy's patrons, none mattered more than P. V. Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister from 1991 to 1996. The two had met in 1971 at the Hindu temple Tirupati Balaji and entered into a kind of symbiosis. Mr. Rao was ''a bit of a provincial country bumpkin'' eager for the contacts and intelligence the guru could provide. Chandraswamy won him over by passing on what other party members were saying about him, said Mr. Sitapati, author of the biography ''Half-Lion: How P. V. Narasimha Rao Transformed India.'' ''He needed someone like Chandraswamy who could use the back channels,'' Mr. Sitapati said. When Mr. Rao was unexpectedly named prime minister in 1991, after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, Chandraswamy's ashram became a hub for Delhi's power circles. He vacationed aboard Mr. Khashoggi's 282-foot yacht, Nabila. (It was later used as a set for a James Bond film and owned for a time by Donald J. Trump.) Subramanian Swamy, a member of Parliament and a longtime friend of the guru's, said Chandraswamy's prominence began to attract ill will. ''He was jetting around the world, living in great comfort,'' Mr. Swamy said. ''A guru is supposed to sit in a hut.'' His time in the limelight ended with breathtaking swiftness. In 1996, Chandraswamy was arrested on charges of defrauding Lakhubhai Pathak, a London-based Indian-born businessman, of $100,000. Mr. Pathak, nicknamed the ''pickle king'' by the popular news media for the commodity his family business sold, claimed the money he had given to Chandraswamy was meant for Mr. Rao, who left power in 1996. Chandraswamy was acquitted in the case, as was Mr. Rao, who faced fraud charges. An income-tax raid on the guru's ashram reportedly turned up records of $11 million in payments to Mr. Khashoggi, who was later implicated as a middleman in the Iran-contra scandal, the clandestine effort in which the Reagan administration sold arms to Iran and channeled the proceeds illegally to right-wing counterrevolutionaries in Nicaragua. In 1997, Congress Party leaders suggested that Chandraswamy was party to the conspiracy that led to Mr. Gandhi's assassination, though the investigation was curtailed the next year and he was never charged. He was prohibited from traveling abroad, however, and politicians who had sought Chandraswamy's blessings for years now avoided him. Even Mr. Rao, his old friend, kept his distance. ''Many of these people, who looked upon him as a spiritual person, seeing that he was not able to protect himself -- naturally, there was a devaluation,'' Mr. Swamy said. ''They suddenly felt, if this is what the state is doing to him, you better avoid him.'' Mr. Sitapati, who interviewed the guru repeatedly in 2015 and 2016, said Chandraswamy's only visitors were low-level officials. ''He had a very lonely life,'' he said. ''His face would totally light up when he started talking about the 1970s and 1980s. It was really like the autumn of the patriarch.'' There was no immediate word on whether he left survivors. Chandraswamy was cremated last week on the banks of the Yamuna River in a ceremony attended by a handful of mourners. The Press Trust of India said there were no V.I.P.s among them."
50142,"Jan Murray, 89, Dies; Stand-Up Comic Became TV Host","Jan Murray, a stand-up comedian who became one of television's first stars, died yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif.","Jan Murray, a stand-up comedian who became one of television's first stars, died yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 89. He had suffered from deteriorating health for the past few months, according to his son Howard Murray. Mr. Murray belonged to a close-knit generation of New York stand-up comics who honed their craft in local clubs and successfully made the transition to the then-novel medium of television. ''The house was always filled with comedians,'' said his daughter Diane Murray, recalling her father's friends -- Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, Shecky Greene and Buddy Hackett -- who gathered for dinner and poker games at their home. ''It was an unusual house, but when you are growing up, you don't realize that's not normal,'' she said. Mr. Murray's gravelly voice and quick wit entertained a generation of Americans through a long string of television game shows, including ''Songs For Sale,'' which had been a radio show and ran on television from 1950 to 1952, and ''Dollar a Second,'' which ran from 1953 to 1957. He also was the creator and producer of his most popular show, ''Treasure Hunt,'' which ran from 1956 to 1959. ''Treasure Hunt,'' though it was one of the most highly rated daytime shows, was canceled in the wake of the scandals that centered on ''Twenty One'' and ''The $64,000 Question.'' Mr. Murray then began a new show, ''Charge Account,'' of which he was host from 1960 to 1962. Mr. Murray also appeared in about 20 movies and worked as a substitute host for Johnny Carson on ''The Tonight Show.'' He retired at 82, citing asthma. Jan Murray was born Murray Janofsky on Oct 4, 1916, in the Bronx, family members said yesterday. His parents, Herman and Celia Janofsky, were immigrants from Eastern Europe. ''We're not sure if they were from Poland or Russia,'' Howard Murray said. ''The border changed weekly in those days.'' The Janofskys lived on Longfellow Avenue, and Mr. Janofsky worked in the garment industry. When Mr. Murray was a boy, his mother would take him to burlesque shows and to the 25-cent vaudeville performances at Loew's Boulevard Theater. After she became ill and could not leave the house, he would memorize the acts and perform them at her bedside. At 18, Mr. Murray had graduated from his audience of one to packed houses at the Melody Club in Union City, N.J. He commuted two hours by bus and subway and earned about $50 a week. He made his reputation in the Catskills working as a tummeler, a Yiddish term for an all-around entertainer. Mr. Murray changed his name when he began performing. ''One of his first agents told him that it would not be an easy name for the audiences to remember,'' his son said. He married Pearl Cohen in 1939, but they divorced. He later met a showgirl, Kathleen Mann, whom he married in 1949. His second wife's nickname was Toni, and his production company, Jantone Productions, was named for the couple. In addition to his wife and his son Howard and daughter Diane, both of Los Angeles, he is survived by a son by his first marriage, Walter Murray of Los Angeles; a daughter, Celia, of Apple Valley, Calif.; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. The family often shared a story about the blend of cultures in Mr. Murray's circle. Passover Seder at the Murrays was a Hollywood tradition, with a guest list of 40 on each of the two nights. Among the regular guests were Jackie Gleason, Jerry Lewis, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme. Though it was a Jewish holiday feast, the chef was always Mr. Murray's Irish Catholic mother-in-law from Mississippi, Bertie Murphy. One year, she came to the Seder upset and pulled her daughter aside. ''Kathleen, I've forgotten the rolls!'' she said, not realizing that on Passover, Jews eat matzo and leavened bread is forbidden."

He was 82 and a resident of Fresno, Calif. The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said. Two of the nation's fastest men in the 1930's were born in Kansas within two years of each other. One, Glenn Cunningham, was widely regarded as the dominant miler of his day, but in 28 races in which he and Mr. San Romani, a native of Frontenac, faced each other, the record shows a dead heat, with each finishing ahead of the other 14 times. Mr. San Romani, whose right leg was so mangled when he was run over by a truck at the age of 8 that doctors initially thought amputation was the only way to save his life, began running as rehabilitation. He won admission to Kansas State Teachers College in Emporia by promising the track coach he would make the 1936 Olympic team. By the time he graduated, he had broken a series of world relay and collegiate mile and 1,500-meter records. He also made the 1936 Olympic team and placed fourth in the 1,500, behind John Lovelock, Cunningham and Luigi Beccali, then, in a match race, became the only man to beat Mr. Lovelock. Mr. San Romani later taught music in the Anaheim, Calif., school system. Survivors include his wife, Lena, a son, 4 daughters, 14 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren."

He was 85. His death followed complications from a thyroid condition, said Barry Chevannes, a longtime friend and anthropology professor at the university. Mr. Planno was one of the most influential people in the development of Rastafarianism, a sect whose members mostly regard Africa as the promised land and Haile Selassie as a divine figure. Though rejected by mainstream Jamaican society, the movement grew into a structured religion, in large part under Mr. Planno's influence. Some Rastafarians smoke marijuana as a sacrament, but others object to its use. Most Rastafarians preach a oneness with nature and grow their hair long and wear it in dreadlocks. Mr. Planno taught the principles of Rastafarianism at his home in the Kingston ghetto of Trench Town to students that included the singer Bob Marley, perhaps the best-known adherent of the movement."
30413,"Jacques Francais, 80, Dies; Dealer in String Instruments","Jacques Francais, a dealer in classical string instruments who with a glance could authenticate a Stradivarius worth millions and then often match it with its next player, died on Wednesday in Manhattan.","Jacques Francais, a dealer in classical string instruments who with a glance could authenticate a Stradivarius worth millions and then often match it with its next player, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 80. The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his wife, Beatrice, said. Mr. Francais's accomplishments included assembling, in 1971, an exhibition at Lincoln Center of antique French violins that had never been shown outside France and that had not been seen there in public since the Exposition Universelle in 1900. In 1985, he completed a 20-year hunt for two violins, a viola and a cello that Antonio Stradivari had made to be played together but that had been sold separately. And in 1996 he brokered the $4 million sale of the cellist Emanuel Feuermann's instrument, made by Stradivari in 1730. For years Mr. Francais (pronounced frahn-SAY) presided over an atmospheric workshop near Carnegie Hall, complete with fireplace, venerable paintings, an enormous window and almost priceless violins scattered about. But Mr. Francais knew that every violin had a price, and he knew what that price was, or at least the price he wanted to pay or receive. Each year in the 1980's and 90's he negotiated the sale of 6 to 10 violins made by the great masters Antonio Stradivari and Joseph Guarnerius del Gesu. That number was estimated to be as many as half the world sales. He also brought a marksman's eye to spotting the fakes that so many people showed him in hope of receiving his prized certification. After a brief look, Mr. Francais almost always said ""No,"" at no charge. ""Then I am free to tell them that my opinion is final, and they cannot ask questions,"" he said in 1977. For all his business acumen, it was the artistic side of his ethereal profession that Mr. Francais held dearest, Mrs. Francais said. He belonged to a 200-year line of luthiers, as makers, restorers and dealers of string instruments are called, and enjoyed nothing so much as matching a great musician with a great instrument. Isaac Stern wrote on a photo on Mr. Francais's desk: ""For Jacques -- whose vast knowledge is matched only by his compassion for fiddlers' foibles -- he ministers lovingly to our needs and we are grateful."" Jacques Pierre Francais was born in Paris on July 3, 1923. One of his grandfathers was Henri Francais, official violin maker to the Paris Conservatory; the other was the violin and cello dealer Albert Caressa. The two jointly owned one of the world's best violin-making and repair shops. Mr. Francais's godfather was the violinist Jacques Thibaud. Mr. Francais (who omitted the accent in his last name in this country) wanted to be an artist, his wife said, but his father, Emile, demanded that he stay in the family's craft. He worked as an apprentice in Mirecourt, the historical center of French violin-making. He also apprenticed in Mittenwald, the German equivalent. In World War II he served with the Free French ski troops and then joined the occupation force in Vienna, where his knowledge of French, German and English proved useful. Mr. Francais then came to New York to apprentice with Rembert Wurlitzer, who ran the most complete violin restoration shop in the United States. After a year he returned to Paris to apprentice with his father, who drilled him intensively on recognizing the origin of violins. In 1948 Mr. Francais came to New York on a one-way ticket with 20 violins, 4 cellos and 24 bows to sell on consignment, as well as fine etchings, also on consignment, and $50. Mr. Francais went on to own Jacques Francais Rare Violins Inc., which employed a dozen top experts. People brought more and more important instruments to be inspected or repaired by the company's experts, which further sharpened their expertise. Mr. Francais considered the wood used to make and repair fine violins -- maple and spruce -- very important, and knew and tracked the old European violin-makers as they planned to retire so he could bid for their wood. He said he believed that the secret to the great Italian violins was a slow-drying varnish used in the 17th century, though some scientists dispute that theory. Mr. Francais met Beatrice Mathews when she went to his shop with a violin. Both were married, but when they met after they had both become single again, he greeted her using the description of her violin, ""red Scarampella."" She became his third wife. In addition to his wife, Mr. Francais is survived by a daughter, Isabelle, who lives in Manhattan and the south of France, and a granddaughter. Mrs. Francais would not say how many Stradivarius violins her husband left behind. For him, the interesting question was always where he would find the next one. ""It is not the money,"" he told a reporter. ""It is the hunt."""

44793,"Khomeini, Imam of Iran And Foe of U.S., Is Dead","Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeine died today, 12 days after he underwent surgery for bleeding in his digestive system, the official Iranian news agency reported.","Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeine died today, 12 days after he underwent surgery for bleeding in his digestive system, the official Iranian news agency reported. He was believed to be 89 years old. ''The leader of the Islamic revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeine, passed away at a Teheran Hospital,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency reported in an urgent dispatch. (Reuters reported that a statement from his son Ahmad, his chief aide, accompanied the announcement. (''The lofty spirit of the leader of Moslems and free men everywhere, His Excellency Imam Khomeini, has gone to Heaven and his heart, which was brimming with love for God and the oppressed of mankind, stopped beating,'' it said.) The Ayatollah is referred to by Iranians as the imam, or spiritual leader. Death Follows Surgery IRNA said Ayatollah Khomeini's death ''took place after a surgical operation to stop bleeding in his digestive system on Tuesday, 23rd May.'' Teheran Radio, the state-run radio, also reported the Ayatollah's death in its early morning broadcast, the British Broadcasting Corporation, reported in London. Yesterday, Iran had said Ayatollah Khomeini's health was deteriorating and urged the nation to pray for the leader, who underwent surgery last mont for bleeding in his digestive system. Iran's state-run radio and television monitored in Nicosia, had said the Ayatollah's condition was declining but it gave no details. Both carried a brief statement from Ayatollah Khomeini's office that said: ''At 3:00 P.M. on Saturday a complication arose in the imama's condition, which the doctors are trying to control. We urge the nation to pray for the imam's health, and hope that their prayers will be ansered.'' Earlier in the week, the television said a ''slight cardiac complication'' had arisen May 27, but that it was relieved the next day. Iran's main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Kahlq, or People's Holy Warriors, said last week that Ayatollah Khomeini suffered a heart attack on May 27. The statement by the Iraq-based group said the heart attack came five days after he underwent surgery on the duodenum, a part of the small intestine close to the stomach. The Mujahedeen's claim could not be independently confirmed. Ayatollah Khomeini had been reported ailing since he suffered a heart attack in 1986. Since then the was rarely seen outside his home in the north Tehran suburb of Jamaran. Speculation Is Heightened But his hospitalization heightened already intense speculation about who will succeed Khomeini as leader of the theocratic state. Political turmoil ahs gripped the country since Ayatollah Khomeine launched a radical resurgence in February with his death decree against British author Salman Rushdie for allegedly blashpeming against Islam in his novel, ''The Satanic Verses.'' A purge of so-called moderates who apparently favored rebuilding ties with the West followed as the 10-year-old islamic regime withdrew into its traditional isolationist stance. Ouster of Chosen Successor Ayatollah Khomeini in March ousted his designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, 64, who had openly criticized the regime's short-comings, and then appointed a 20-member committee to review the succession. But in the absence of a single personality who could match the patriarch's political and revolutionary authority, there was widespread speculation that Iran may be ruled by collective leadership in the post-Khomeini era."
8174,"Wendy Scott, 50, Who Faked Illness for Attention","Wendy Scott, who had one of the most severe cases on record of a syndrome in which people feign illness or make themselves sick to get medical treatment, died on Oct. 14 at a hospice in South London.","Wendy Scott, who had one of the most severe cases on record of a syndrome in which people feign illness or make themselves sick to get medical treatment, died on Oct. 14 at a hospice in South London. She was 50. The cause was intestinal cancer, said Mary Jane Lang, a friend of Miss Scott. Miss Scott, who lived in London, spent 12 years traveling from one hospital to another in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, pretending to be ill so that she could become a patient. She was admitted to hundreds of hospitals and underwent 42 operations, nearly all of them unnecessary. Remarkably, Miss Scott recovered from the condition, called Munchausen syndrome, which many doctors consider untreatable. In an interview in The New York Times on July 20, Miss Scott said she had not faked her way into a hospital in 20 years. She credited her devotion to a pet with helping her recover. She became so attached to a kitten that she gave up hospitals for fear the kitten would be neglected in her absence. In recent years, she tried to help other people with Munchausen syndrome, communicating with them by mail, telephone and Internet. She also approached Dr. Marc Feldman, a psychiatrist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an expert on Munchausen syndrome, who said she had helped a number of patients. In the last year, Ms. Scott became increasingly ill but had difficulty obtaining medical care in London because of her notorious record. While visiting Miss Lang in the United States last summer, she sought help from Dr. Feldman, whose colleagues in Birmingham discovered that she had advanced intestinal cancer. Miss Scott remained in the hospital in Birmingham until last month, and then returned to London. Miss Scott was born in 1948 in Wemyss, in the Fife region of Scotland near the North Sea. Information about survivors was not available. http://www.nytimes.com"

Bennett, a Florida Democrat who was a champion of ethical reforms in Congress and who sponsored the legislation that put ""In God We Trust"" on currency, died on Sept. 6 in Jacksonville, Fla.","WASHINGTON, Sept. 9 Charles E. Bennett, a Florida Democrat who was a champion of ethical reforms in Congress and who sponsored the legislation that put ""In God We Trust"" on currency, died on Sept. 6 in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 92. Mr. Bennett spent 44 years in the House of Representatives, more than 40 of them without missing a vote on legislation. ""I'm not a brilliant person,"" he said in The New York Times in 1991. ""I do produce some good legislation. But I've never been accused of being a genius. But I feel that being there and making the vote is my duty and responsibility."" He said he had ducked out of funerals, bolted from hospital beds and defied snowstorms to get to the Capitol for a vote. He once rolled onto the House floor in a wheelchair. His legislation in 1955 required that the mint put ""In God We Trust"" on all currency; the words appeared only on coins beginning in the 1860's. The measure passed the House and Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The next year, Congress made the words the national motto. Mr. Bennett said America had to distinguish itself from other world superpowers. ""In these days when imperialistic and materialistic communism seeks to attack and destroy freedom, we should continuously look for ways to strengthen the foundations of our freedom,"" he said of his bill from the House floor in April 1955. ""At the base of our freedom is our faith in God and the desire of Americans to live by his will and his guidance. As long as this country trusts in God, it will prevail."" Nicknamed ""Mr. Clean,"" Mr. Bennett sponsored the legislation that created the House Ethics Committee and served as its first chairman. A sponsor of the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act, he walked with canes, the result of polio he contracted in the Army in World War II while leading guerrillas in jungles in the Philippines. Mr. Bennett, who received the Silver Star, returned hundreds of thousands of dollars in wartime disability checks to the Treasury. A lawyer by training, he was a leading advocate for the creation of a permanent Congressional ethics committee in the 1960's and declined to accept contributions from military contractors, even though he could have easily drawn such donations as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee. He also consistently voted against Congressional pay raises. Charles Edward Bennett was born in Canton, N.Y., on Dec. 2, 1910. He was raised in Tampa, Fla., and was a graduate of the University of Florida at Gainesville and its law school. He practiced law in Jacksonville until 1942, when he enlisted in the Army. He was discharged in 1947, as a captain, and was elected to Congress the following year representing the Jacksonville area. He wrote several books on the early history of Florida. In 1992, Mr. Bennett retired from Congress after his wife, Jean, suffered a stroke. Survivors include his wife of 50 years; three children, Lucinda Bennett of Jacksonville, Bruce Bennett of Lake Worth, Fla., and James Bennett of Glastonbury, Conn.; and three grandchildren. The death of a third son, Charles Jr., in 1977 from a drug overdose inspired him to push for antidrug legislation, including a measure to authorize the military, primarily the Navy, to help civilian law-enforcement agencies interdict drug traffic outside United States borders."
37463,"Masayoshi Ito, 80, Japanese Politician","Masayoshi Ito, a conservative Japanese politician who was Foreign Minister briefly in the early 1980's, died today, NHK television reported.","TOKYO, May 20 Masayoshi Ito, a conservative Japanese politician who was Foreign Minister briefly in the early 1980's, died today, NHK television reported. He was 80. In April 1989, he was asked to take over as Prime Minister from Noboru Takeshita, who had been disgraced in the Recruit influence-peddling and bribery scandal. Some members of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party viewed Mr. Ito as a potential rescuer because he was one of the few politicians who had not been implicated in the affair. The scandal involved illicit payments and gifts of stock in the Recruit conglomerate in exchange for political favors. Mr. Ito, who was suffering from diabetes, declined the Prime Minister's post for health reasons and because he felt that party leaders were not interested in making fundamental changes in the political system. He retired from Parliament when general elections were held in July 1993. In June 1980, he had served as Acting Prime Minister for a month after the sudden death of Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira, his political mentor. Mr. Ito also served as Foreign Minister from July 1980 to May 1981 in the Government of Mr. Ohira's successor, Zenko Suzuki. He resigned in a dispute with Mr. Suzuki over a Government declaration that Japan was in an ""alliance"" with the United States, a statement that was later amended. The issue of close ties with Washington was delicate in Japan, and Mr. Ito's resignation was generally viewed by the public as a gesture of principle."

Ross, who helped perfect the transistor and calculate whether the moon's surface could support a spaceship's weight, and then went on to lead Bell Laboratories, the legendary fount of technological marvels and Nobel Prize winners, died on March 10 at his home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla.","Ian M. Ross, who helped perfect the transistor and calculate whether the moon's surface could support a spaceship's weight, and then went on to lead Bell Laboratories, the legendary fount of technological marvels and Nobel Prize winners, died on March 10 at his home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. He was 85. The cause was complications of pneumonia, his wife, Christina, said. For much of the 20th century Bell Labs was among the world's largest research institutions. Its mission was to help AT&T, the telephone monopoly and its corporate parent, cope with everything from digital communication to squirrels chewing phone lines. Its thousands of scientists and engineers fostered discoveries like the transistor, the laser and information theory, earning seven Nobel Prizes and 29,000 patents. Dr. Ross was Bell Labs' president when its mission changed radically in 1984, after AT&T had spun off its local phone companies to settle a federal antitrust suit. The loss of these so-called Baby Bells -- subsidiaries like New York Telephone and Southern Bell -- opened the door for AT&T to hurl its economic and technological might into new, unregulated businesses to compete with companies like I.B.M. Bell Labs was the glamorous vanguard of this drive to go beyond communications into all phases of information technology. Preaching ''urgency,'' Dr. Ross nudged his army of scientists to align their sometimes spectacularly esoteric schemes and dreams with market needs, going so far as to dispatch some of them to accompany AT&T sales employees on their rounds. But he refused to give specific instructions to the 10 percent of Bell employees doing basic research, an enterprise that, among other things, yielded proof that the universe started with a Big Bang. ''It's a foolish thing to tell a research person what the problem is -- you'll get the answer to that problem and miss a brilliant discovery in the process,'' he said. In the three years after AT&T's breakup, the labs' wizards never paused, conjuring wonders like an undersea fiber-optic cable to a superfast computer algorithm for solving complex problems. In 1996, five years after Dr. Ross retired, AT&T split into three companies, one of which was its old manufacturing arm, renamed Lucent Technologies. Lucent took most of Bell Labs' personnel. Lucent at first performed well, increasing the lab's budget and staff. Then the markets for both its shares and products dipped, and in 2006 Lucent merged with Alcatel, a French company. Two years later, Alcatel-Lucent announced that Bell Labs was pulling out of basic science to focus on more immediately marketable fields. SBC Communications, a former Baby Bell, bought AT&T's bones (not including Bell Labs) in 2005 and took its name. Ian Munro Ross was born on Aug. 15, 1927, in Southport, England, and joined Bell in 1952 after earning a doctorate in mechanical sciences from the University of Cambridge. William Shockley, who led the team that invented the transistor in 1947, hired him. In a 2009 oral history interview, Dr. Ross said he had intended to stay for no more than a year but gave up that plan after finding the intellectual buzz there ''exhilarating.'' An early assignment was to organize a symposium to tell other companies everything Bell had learned about making transistors, the lightning-fast switches that underpin modern electronics. The fee to attend the symposium was only $25,000, as a down payment on a 5 percent licensing charge. Dr. Ross said the relatively small fee reflected AT&T's hope that the companies would develop things AT&T could use. Thus did Texas Instruments, Fairchild and Sony get a jump-start on a multibillion-dollar field. Dr. Ross's early years at Bell were devoted to guiding teams working to improve the transistor. One effort involved making advances in ''field effect'' transistors, which became a mainstay of integrated circuits, the term for a set of electronic circuits on a small plate, or ''chip,'' of semiconductor material. Another team developed epitaxy, the growing of specialized silicon crystals to make super-thin semiconductor wafers. The wafers allowed for greater speed and memory and led to a new generation of computers, microprocessors and switching systems. In the oral history, Dr. Ross said of epitaxy: ''You know, the reaction, I think, in the industry was a sigh of relief that you could hear from coast to coast. And quite a number of cries, 'Why didn't I think of that?' '' Dr. Ross next ran two of Bell's semiconductor laboratories and oversaw electronics on Telstar, the first communications satellite. In 1964, he was named managing director of Bellcomm, a Bell systems unit formed solely to plan Apollo moon missions. Bellcomm's tasks included determining that the lunar surface was almost certainly not composed of dust so powdery that a landing vehicle would just keep sinking. NASA said moon missions would not have succeeded without Bellcomm's guidance. After returning to Bell Labs, Dr. Ross was named president in 1979. He was AT&T's first witness in defending itself against federal charges of antitrust violations in 1981. He called the Bell system ''interactive and interdependent,'' but conceded that it had withheld information from competitors. Dr. Ross belonged to the National Academy of Engineering, the National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Academy of Engineering, and won many industry and professional awards. He is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Christina Leinberg; his son, Tim; his daughters, Nancy Ross and Stina Ross; and two grandchildren. Dr. Ross was described as a quiet man, but he could not help bragging -- or at least expressing wonderment -- about the stunning electronic achievements he had helped foster. ''If we had had the same progress in the aircraft industry, you and I could be flying between London and New York in 500,000-seat planes and the fare would be about 25 cents,'' he once said."
41190,"Dom DeLuise, Comic Actor, Dies at 75","Dom DeLuise, a pudgy actor whose manic grin and air of desperation added comic bounce to films like ''The Twelve Chairs,'' ''Blazing Saddles'' and ''The Cannonball Run,'' died Monday in Los Angeles.","Dom DeLuise, a pudgy actor whose manic grin and air of desperation added comic bounce to films like ''The Twelve Chairs,'' ''Blazing Saddles'' and ''The Cannonball Run,'' died Monday in Los Angeles. He was 75 and lived in Pacific Palisades. The Associated Press reported that his son Michael had told a television and radio station in Los Angeles that his father had died after a long illness. Mr. DeLuise first made his mark on television in the early 1960's as Dominick the Great, an inept but determined magician trying desperately to maintain his poise as one trick after another failed. He created the character for ''The Garry Moore Show'' and brought it to the CBS variety series ''The Entertainers,'' where the ensemble cast included Bob Newhart and Carol Burnett, and ''The Dean Martin Summer Show.'' Before long Mr. DeLuise was appearing in films, usually in broad comedies as a nervous sidekick, a schmo or a preposterous fraud. He was a favorite of Mel Brooks, who cast him as the greedy Father Fyodor in ''The Twelve Chairs'' (1970), the director's silly assistant in ''Silent Movie'' (1976), the Emperor Nero in ''History of the World -- Part I'' (1981), the voice of Pizza the Hutt in ''Spaceballs'' (1987) and the Godfather-like Don Giovanni in ''Robin Hood: Men in Tights'' (1993). Burt Reynolds, another fan, teamed up with Mr. DeLuise in several films, including ''Smokey and the Bandit II'' (1980), ''The Cannonball Run'' (1981) and ''The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' (1982). Dominick DeLuise was born in Brooklyn and, after graduating from the High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan, attended Tufts. He broke into show business in the late 1950's in parts like Tinker the Toymaker in the daytime television show ''Tinker's Workshop.'' (The show's creator and first host, Bob Keeshan, had gone on to create and star in ''Captain Kangaroo.'') He then made regular appearances on ''The Shari Lewis Show'' as a bumbling private eye. After making his Broadway debut in 1963 as the cheerfully nervous mountebank Muffin T. Ragamuffin in ''The Student Gypsy,'' he appeared as a nervous flier in the cold-war thriller ''Fail-Safe'' (1964). This serious role was atypical. His chubby face and hysterical laugh made him a natural for comic roles, like the dimwitted spy in the Doris Day film ''The Glass Bottom Boat'' (1966). These parts he attacked over the ensuing decades with scene-stealing abandon. Working with Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Brooks, Mr. DeLuise went on a tear in the 1970s and early 1980s. Gene Wilder cast him as a hammy opera star in ''The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother'' (1975) and as the mad studio chief Adolf Zitz in ''The World's Greatest Lover'' (1977). He made a cameo appearance as a wild-eyed agent in ''The Muppet Movie'' (1979), took on a tragicomic role as a compulsive eater in ''Fatso'' (1980), and directed his first film, ''Hot Stuff'' (1979), in which he also took a starring role opposite Suzanne Pleshette. Mr. DeLuise's performances, never marked by restraint, stuck at fortissimo as time went on. Films like ''Loose Cannons'' (1990), in which he played the obese pornographer Harry (the Hippo) Gutterman, did him no favors, and he reached a nadir in ''The Silence of the Hams'' (1994), a horror spoof, in which he played Dr. Animal Cannibal Pizza. As his film career declined, Mr. DeLuise found a creative outlet in food. A talented amateur chef, he began doing cooking demonstrations on television and wrote several cookbooks, including, ''Eat This . . . It'll Make You Feel Better!'' (1988) and ''Eat This Too!: It'll Also Make You Feel Better'' (1997). He also wrote ''Charlie the Caterpillar,'' ''The Pouch Potato'' and other books for children. In 1965 he married the actress Carol Arthur, who survives him. In addition to his son Michael, he is survived by two other sons. Peter and David, and three grandchildren. His toughest acting assignment was his first, he told the writer Ronald L. Smith in 1992 for the book ''Who's Who in Comedy.'' He was handed the role of a penny in a school play. ''The part called for me to roll under a bed as soon as the curtain went up and stay there until I was found in the very last scene,'' he said. ''It was my hardest role to date. I detested having to be quiet and out of the action for so long.''"

49884,"Russell M. Saunders, Stuntman in Movies, Is Dead at 82","Russell M. Saunders, whose daring stunts in more than 100 movies overshadowed even his acrobatic antics on Santa Monica's fabled Muscle Beach, died on May 29 at a nursing home in West Los Angeles.","Russell M. Saunders, whose daring stunts in more than 100 movies overshadowed even his acrobatic antics on Santa Monica's fabled Muscle Beach, died on May 29 at a nursing home in West Los Angeles. He was 82. Doubling for actors like Alan Ladd, Gene Kelly, Red Buttons and Jack Benny, Mr. Saunders literally threw himself into the profession of appearing to risk his life, sometimes bringing that appearance perilously close to reality. Once when doubling for Richard Widmark, he jumped off a 50-foot cliff and broke his arm so badly on a rock in the water that he could never fully straighten it again. His partners in subsequent acrobatic acts had to learn to perform with one crooked arm to preserve the all-important symmetry. He did Ladd's famous fight scene in ""Shane"" in 1953; jumped off a 60-foot bridge for Robert Cummings in ""Saboteur"" in 1942; and was the agile figure leaping from rooftop to rooftop in the 1948 version of ""The Three Musketeers."" That ended with his catching a waving flag that ripped, then swinging on its shreds into an open window. Fay Alexander, the great circus acrobat who himself doubled for Tony Curtis and Doris Day in circus movies, said that performance was the greatest movie stunt he ever saw. Mr. Alexander, who died last year, called Mr. Saunders ""without a doubt the best all-around acrobat I've ever known."" He certainly had the right look. Salvador Dali used the perfectly proportioned acrobat as a model for his painting ""The Christ of St. John,"" making him what fellow stuntmen delighted in calling the ultimate double. Indeed, other stuntmen, many of whom learned their skills from him, praised Mr. Saunders's often breathtaking skills. Brayton Yerkes called him flamboyant, and ""the best all-around stuntman I've known."" Another stuntman, Gary Morgan, lauded Mr. Saunders's ability to imitate an actor's precise mannerisms, down to the peculiarities of his walk. Mr. Morgan, who learned the tricks of the trade from Mr. Saunders, remembered him working on several movies at the same time on the MGM lot: diving through a window for one picture, immediately doing a fight scene in another and then racing off to do acrobatics for Gene Kelly. ""He sometimes got four checks in a day,"" marveled Mr. Morgan, who got his first job through Mr. Saunders and whose own most recent stunt work was for the coming film ""Rush Hour II."" Mr. Morgan pointed out that stuntmen used to face far greater dangers than they do today, when they can use supporting wires that can be digitally removed from the film. Russell Maurice Saunders was born on a farm outside Winnipeg, Manitoba, on May 21, 1919, the youngest of eight children. His father was a farmer and railroad worker. His only immediate survivors are two sisters, Edna Hall of Penticton, British Columbia, and Doris Sandore of Newport Beach, Calif. His future was foreshadowed when, as a very young boy, he jumped off the barn, cradling two chickens, sure that they would enable him to fly. An older sister who worked as a cashier in the local movie house let him in free. He hung around circuses. He went to a summer camp specializing in acrobatics and began to develop skills that propelled him to Canadian championships in diving and gymnastics. He tried to enlist in the Canadian Air Force, but was rejected because he was color-blind. He then moved to California, where one of his sisters was living. He thought he might go to college, but got only as far as making friends with the diving coaches at the University of Southern California and the University of California at Los Angles, who helped him find jobs in water shows, one of which starred Bing Crosby. During World War II, he volunteered to serve in the United States Army as a paratrooper, but was later assigned to an Armed Force Aquacade in England. Soon after his arrival in California, he heard of Muscle Beach, then a platform just south of the pier in Santa Monica, where the great acrobats came to practice and show off. It later became the home of body builders like Jack La Lanne, another admirer. Mr. Saunders refused to lift weights. ""He said he'd rather lift girls than weights,"" Mr. Morgan said. Among his achievements on Muscle Beach was somersaulting over 14 people who were standing side by side and bending over. He also became so well known as a generous teacher who never charged for his considerable expertise that some called the beach Russell Beach, Ms. Boelsems said. Even after the platform that defined Muscle Beach was torn down in 1959 because the city thought it drew unsavory crowds, he continued to take his own equipment, including trampolines and teeterboards, to the beach to teach children. He called his trainees Muscle Beach AcroBrats. ""This has to be the only place in the world where someone can just walk up and receive free gymnastic instruction from pros,"" he said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1986. Mr. Morgan said Mr. Saunders was offered chances to move up in the movie business, including an offer to direct. But he never accepted a directing job, though he was often confused with Russell Saunders, a well-known assistant director, who died in 1987. ""Russ was like a big kid,"" Mr. Morgan said. ""He didn't want to interfere with anything that would interfere with him having fun."""

He was 89. The Heinz Sielmann Foundation, which he founded, announced his death but did not give a cause. Millions of Germans knew Mr. Sielmann through his popular television show ''Expeditions Into the Animal Kingdom,'' which ran from 1965 to 1991 and taught a generation about the wonders of nature. He gained international fame with his feature films about animal life, including award-winning works like ''Lords of the Forest,'' ''Galapagos: Dream Island in the Pacific,'' ''Vanishing Wilderness'' and ''The Mystery of Animal Behavior.'' For ''Lords of the Forest'' (1959), Mr. Sielmann spent 18 months filming gorillas in what was then the Belgian Congo. Known by the title ''Masters of the Congo Jungle'' in the United States, where it was narrated by Orson Welles, the film was among the first to depict gorillas as social, peaceful animals and not the violent beasts many thought them to be. Mr. Sielmann, who worked extensively with the BBC and the National Geographic Society during his 70-year career, founded the Heinz Sielmann Foundation in 1994 with his wife, Inge. It strives to promote a better understanding of nature and conservation among German children and to protect German regions where rare animals and plants live. Mr. Sielmann's wife will now run the foundation."

Phelan, an author and a dogged investigative reporter who made a crusade out of exposing the reclusive billionaire Howard R. Hughes, died on Monday at his home in Temecula, Calif. He was 85. The cause was lung cancer, Janet Phelan, a daughter, said yesterday. Mr. Phelan died just before the publication of his book ""Money: The Battle for Howard Hughes's Billions,"" which was written with Lewis Chester. The book is due from Random House next month. Mr. Phelan, who worked on the staff of The Saturday Evening Post and as a freelance writer for several other publications, including The New York Times and Paris Match, seemed endlessly intrigued by the financial dealings and political machinations of Mr. Hughes. His best-selling 1976 book, ""Howard Hughes: The Hidden Years,"" an account based largely on the experiences of two Hughes aides, offered the first inside look at the life of Mr. Hughes, who died in 1976. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California credited his re-election victory over Richard M. Nixon in 1962 to an article by Mr. Phelan in The Reporter magazine about a loan that Mr. Hughes had made to Mr. Nixon. Another investigation by Mr. Phelan helped reveal that Clifford Irving's purported biography of Mr. Hughes was based on Mr. Phelan's unpublished manuscript, not on interviews with Mr. Hughes, as Mr. Irving had claimed. The hoax cost Mr. Irving 17 months in a Federal prison. Born in Alton, Ill., Mr. Phelan began his career at The Alton Evening Telegraph, then moved to the West Coast in 1947 to work for newspapers in Long Beach, Calif. In his 1982 book, ""Scandals, Scamps and Scoundrels: The Casebook of an Investigative Reporter,"" he chronicled his career starting as a green newspaper reporter who thought he had dug up a big story about gangsters and wound up tossed in a ditch with a gun pressed against his head. In his memoir, he also said he had learned early on that many news organizations considered investigative reporting too expensive, risky and time-consuming. ""The chilling effect of libel suits would be substantially reduced,"" he wrote, ""if publishers and editors budgeted more for producing articles and less for lawyers to defend them.""

The concept of jewelry that could alert emergency personnel to allergies and other critical information, as well as provide a toll-free phone number for details, was born in a family emergency. In 1953, Mrs. Collins and her husband, Marion, were vacationing away from Turlock, in the Central Valley of California, when their daughter Linda, a high school sophomore, cut her finger while playing with an air rifle.

Though she had received expert care from a doctor who was her uncle in an excellent hospital founded by her grandfather, she almost died because nobody knew about her allergy. Her father, a physician like his own father, sought to protect her afterward by pinning a piece of paper to her clothing saying, ""Fatally allergic to tetanus antitoxin."" As Linda approached college, she tired of the safety pins and hotly rejected her father's suggestion that a tattoo might fit the bill. ""She said, 'Dad, why don't you fix me some sort of bracelet?'

Mr. Maltz was 76 years old and lived in West Hollywood. Mr. Maltz, the Brooklyn-born son of immigrants, won Oscars for two documentaries, ''The Defeat of the German Armies Near Moscow'' (1942) and ''The House I Live In'' (1945). His most notable pictures were ''This Gun for Hire'' (1942), ''Destination Tokyo'' (1944), ''Pride of the Marines'' (1945) and ''The Naked City'' (1948). For his short story, ''The Happiest Man on Earth,'' he won the O. Henry Memorial Award in 1938 and his major novel, ''The Cross and the Arrow,'' was about the German anti-Nazi resistance movement. Blacklisted by Film Industry Mr. Maltz's screenwriting career was interrupted in the late 1940's when the House Committee on Un-American Activities was investigating reported Communist influence in the movie industry. One producer, one director and eight screenwriters, of which Mr. Maltz was one, refused to answer committee queries, including ''Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?'' The group became known as the ''Hollywood 10.'' For refusing to respond, each was cited for contempt by Congress, sentenced to a year in jail and fined $1,000. They were blacklisted by the film industry. Gradually, some received work but had to use pseudonyms in film credits. After leaving Federal prison, Mr. Maltz lived in Mexico from 1952 to 1962, writing several American films under pseudonyms. By 1964 the blacklist was said to have been discontinued. In 1960 Frank Sinatra tried to defy the blacklist by hiring Mr. Maltz to write the screen adaptation of ''The Execution of Eddie Slovik.'' But Mr. Sinatra, attacked by the Hearst newspapers, the American Legion and other veterans groups, dismissed Mr. Maltz. His most recent screen work included ''Two Mules for Sister Sara'' (1971) and his wife, Esther Maltz, said that after recovering from a stroke last July he worked diligently until his death to finish a novel, ''Bel Canto,'' about the French resistance movement during World War II. Mr., Maltz is survived by his wife and two brothers, Ernest Maltz and Edward Maltz of New York."

23177,Pilots' Unit,"Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., who broke color barriers and shattered racial myths as the commander of the Tuskegee Airmen, the pioneering black fighter pilots of World War II, died on Thursday.","Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Jr., who broke color barriers and shattered racial myths as the commander of the Tuskegee Airmen, the pioneering black fighter pilots of World War II, died on Thursday. He was 89. He died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, an Air Force spokesman said. General Davis, who was a son of the Army's first black general, Benjamin O. Davis Sr., was the first black cadet to graduate from West Point in the 20th century and one of the first black pilots in the military. His leadership of America's only all-black air units of World War II helped speed the integration of the Air Force, and in 1954 he became its first black general. Like his father, General Davis struggled against racism. He was ostracized at West Point and then was barred from commanding white troops and turned away from segregated officers' clubs in the war years. A trim 6 feet 2 inches with a sometimes piercing gaze, a deep voice and an erect military bearing, General Davis carried himself with the knowledge that the stakes were huge: The wartime performance of his men was closely watched by officials who believed that blacks lacked the intelligence and courage to succeed as pilots. ""All the blacks in the segregated forces operated like they had to prove they could fly an airplane when everyone believed they were too stupid,"" General Davis said years later. The airmen commanded by General Davis compiled an outstanding record in combat against the Luftwaffe in the European theater in World War II. They shot down 111 enemy planes and destroyed or damaged 273 on the ground at a cost of more than 70 pilots killed in action or missing. They never lost an American bomber to enemy fighters on their escort missions. As the leader of dozens of missions in P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs, General Davis was highly decorated, receiving the Silver Star for a strafing run into Austria and the Distinguished Flying Cross for a bomber-escort mission to Munich. In his autobiography, ""Benjamin O. Davis Jr.: American"" (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1991), General Davis told of the pressures that he and the fliers who came to be known as the Tuskegee Airmen, for the base where they trained, had encountered in the face of racism. ""We would go through any ordeal that came our way, be it in garrison existence or combat, to prove our worth,"" he said. ""Our airmen considered themselves pioneers in every sense of the word."" Benjamin Oliver Davis Jr. was born on Dec. 18, 1912, in Washington, his mother having returned home while his father was stationed in Wyoming as a lieutenant with an all-black cavalry unit. At 14, he went up with a barnstorming pilot at Bolling Field in Washington in an open-cockpit plane, wearing goggles and a helmet, and after a few dives and steep turns had ""a sudden surge of determination to become an aviator."" Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927 inspired him all the more. After attending the University of Chicago, he entered the United States Military Academy in 1932, having been sponsored by Representative Oscar De Priest of Chicago, the only black member of Congress. His father had been denied an appointment to West Point. In his four years at West Point, no one would room with Cadet Davis and no one would speak to him outside the line of duty. But he surmounted the bigotry and isolation and graduated 35th in a class of 276, only the fourth black graduate in the military academy's history. ""Living as a prisoner in solitary confinement for four years had not destroyed my personality, nor poisoned my attitude toward other people,"" he would write in recalling his thoughts upon graduating. ""I had even managed to keep a sense of humor about the situation; when my father told me of my many supporters, the many people who were pulling for me, I said, 'It's a pity none of them were at West Point.' "" When he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1936, the Army had a grand total of two black line officers -- Benjamin O. Davis Sr. and Benjamin O. Davis Jr. At the start of his senior year at West Point, Cadet Davis applied for the Army Air Corps but was rejected because it did not accept blacks. He had hoped that he would at least be assigned to duty with white troops, but his first posting was with the all-black 24th Infantry Regiment at Fort Benning, Ga. He was not allowed inside the base officers' club, a snub he would regard as one of the greatest insults of his 37 years of military life. He later attended the Army's Infantry School at Fort Benning, but then was assigned to teach military tactics at Tuskegee Institute, a black college in Alabama, something his father had done years before. It was the Army's way to avoid having a black officer command white soldiers in the days when segregation prevailed and black troops performed menial tasks with little hope of promotion. For years, his father had been rotated from one noncombat post to another, often teaching assignments at black colleges, to keep him from commanding white troops. Benjamin O. Davis Sr. served 42 years before he was given the star of a brigadier general. Early in 1941, responding to pressures for broader black participation as war approached, the Roosevelt administration told the War Department to create a black flying unit. Captain Davis was assigned to the first training class at Tuskegee Army Air Field, and in March 1942 he won his wings as one of five black officers to complete the flying course. In July -- having been promoted to lieutenant colonel -- he was named commander of the first all-black air unit, the 99th Pursuit Squadron. The fighter squadron went to North Africa in the spring of 1943 and on June 2, operating out of Tunisia, saw combat for the first time, a dive-bombing mission against the German-held island of Pantelleria. During the summer, the 99th squadron flew missions supporting the invasion of Sicily. In September, Colonel Davis was called back to the United States to command the 332nd Fighter Group, a larger all-black unit preparing to go overseas. But soon afterward, it seemed that the military was about to scuttle its use of black pilots in combat. The top brass of the Army Air Forces recommended to the Army chief of staff, Gen. George Marshall, that the 99th be removed from tactical operations on the ground that it had performed poorly. ""The Negro type has not the proper reflexes to make a first-class fighter pilot,"" one Army Air Forces officer maintained. Having never been told of any deficiencies, Colonel Davis was incensed. He held a news conference at the Pentagon to defend his men and then stated his case to a War Department committee studying the use of black servicemen. General Marshall ordered a top-level inquiry, but permitted the 99th squadron to continue fighting. Months later, the inquiry rated the 99th's performance as comparable to those of other air units in the Mediterranean theater. But questions about the squadron had essentially been put to rest in January 1944, when its pilots downed 12 German fighter planes in two successive days over the Anzio beachhead in Italy. Colonel Davis and his 332nd Fighter Group arrived in Italy soon after that. Based at Ramitelli, and called the Red Tails for the distinctive markings on its planes, the four-squadron unit compiled an outstanding record on missions deep into German territory. In the summer of 1945, Colonel Davis took over the all-black 477th Bombardment Group, which was stationed at Godman Field, Ky. In July 1948, President Truman signed an executive order providing for integration of the armed forces. Colonel Davis helped draft an Air Force blueprint on integration that went into effect the next year, the wartime performance of his fliers having already created a climate for ending segregation. General Davis served at the Pentagon and in overseas posts over the next two decades. He gained the three stars of a lieutenant general in May 1965, when he was the chief of staff for American forces in South Korea. He was later commander of the 13th Air Force, based in the Philippines, and assistant commander of the United States Strike Command, with headquarters in Florida. In 1998 President Bill Clinton awarded him a fourth star, the military's highest peacetime rank. General Davis retired from the military in 1970, then became director of public safety in Cleveland, serving in the administration of Carl Stokes, the first black to be mayor of a large American city. Brought in to stem a rising crime rate and ease tensions between blacks and the city's police, he stayed in the post for only six months, then resigned over what he saw as the Stokes administration's failure to deal firmly with black extremist groups. He then joined the United States Department of Transportation, directing antihijacking efforts. In his five years with the department, he supervised the sky marshal program, security measures at airports and programs to curb cargo thefts. He is survived by a sister, Elnora Davis McLendon, of Washington. His wife, Agatha, died in March. In June 1987 -- more than a half-century after graduating from West Point -- General Davis returned there to see the changes that had been made since the days he was a social outcast and to use its archives for his autobiography. He walked into the visitors center to see an exhibition titled ""The Great Train of Tradition"" -- photographs of outstanding cadets from 1819 to 1950. The Class of 1936 was represented by photos of just two graduates: Gen. William C. Westmoreland, the commander of American forces in Vietnam and a former superintendent at West Point, and General Davis. Under his picture were the"

Correction Appended Brenda Barnes, a two-time corporate chief executive whose decision to leave her top job at Pepsi-Cola sparked a national debate about women juggling career and family, died on Tuesday in Naperville, Ill. She was 63.","Ms. Barnes was a two-time corporate chief executive whose decision to leave a top job at Pepsi-Cola inspired a national debate about women juggling career and family. Correction Appended Brenda Barnes, a two-time corporate chief executive whose decision to leave her top job at Pepsi-Cola sparked a national debate about women juggling career and family, died on Tuesday in Naperville, Ill. She was 63. Her daughter, Erin Barnes, said the cause was complications of a stroke. The elder Ms. Barnes had had a stroke in 2010, after which she gave up her corporate career entirely. Ms. Barnes had been chief executive of Pepsi-Cola North America for a year and a half when she decided in 1997 to step down, saying that after two decades of grueling hours away from home she wanted to spend time with her three children, ages 10, 8 and 7. She was 43 at the time and overseeing PepsiCo's chief profit engine, based in Somers, N.Y., making her one of the most recognized women in corporate America. She resisted the entreaties of her peers to remain at the company, explaining that she had had her fill of days and nights away from her children. ""I hope people can look at my decision not as 'women can't do it' but 'for 22 years Brenda gave her all and did a lot of great things,'"" Ms. Barnes told The Wall Street Journal at the time. ""I don't think there's any man who doesn't have the same struggle. Hopefully, one day corporate America can battle this."" Her choice and the blunt language she used to describe the many burdens executive women had to shoulder elicited sharp reactions. Supporters hailed her decision to put family first. Detractors argued that her retreat from such a lofty post was a defeat for women fighting to be considered men's equals in the boardroom. The debate raged on television talk shows in the United States and in tabloid newspapers in London - much to the surprise of Ms. Barnes, who had never seen herself as a public figure pushing a cause. A private woman by disposition (her nickname growing up outside Chicago was Bashful), Ms. Barnes weathered the public outcry and returned to Illinois with her family, settling in Naperville, about 33 miles west of Chicago. She did not fully retire from corporate life, however. She became a sought-after company director, joining the boards of The New York Times (from 1998 to 2008), Avon, Lucasfilm, Sears and Staples. In 2004, with her children in high school, Ms. Barnes accepted an offer to be a top executive at Sara Lee, the food conglomerate based in Chicago. She was soon named chairwoman and chief executive - becoming one of the few women to run a major American corporation - and given a mandate to revive Sara Lee's sinking fortunes. Ms. Barnes presided over a broad corporate restructuring, selling off noncore businesses and focusing on the company's food brands. But the overhaul did not spur a profit recovery, and Sara Lee's stock price remained stagnant for much of her time there. Ms. Barnes's stroke in 2010 came in May while she was lifting weights at a local gym. It left her incapable of simple motor activities. Three months later, at 56 and after a tough rehabilitation period, she stepped down permanently from Sara Lee. She did not return to corporate life again. Brenda Jo Czajka, a granddaughter of Polish immigrants, was born on Nov. 11, 1953, in Chicago and grew up in River Grove, Ill., a gritty suburb northwest of the city. Her father was a pipe fitter at International Harvester, the agricultural manufacturer; her mother stayed home to look after Brenda and her six sisters. Ms. Barnes began working at 15, helping out at a neighborhood flower shop for $1.25 per hour. (As chief executive of Sara Lee, she earned as much as $15 million a year.) She graduated from Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill., in 1975 with a major in economics. After stints waiting on tables and sorting mail, she landed a job in the back office of Wilson Sporting Goods in Chicago in 1976. Wilson was part of the fast-growing Pepsi conglomerate at the time, and Ms. Barnes began to climb the corporate ladder rapidly while working toward her master's degree in business at Loyola University Chicago, receiving it in 1980. She then moved to a senior job marketing salty snacks at Pepsi's Frito-Lay division in Dallas. Also in 1980, she married Randall Barnes, a top executive at the company. The marriage ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, Ms. Barnes is survived by two sons, Jeff and Brian; her partner, Sal Barrutia; and five sisters, Linda Stebbins, Donna Williams, Rhonda Thompson, Laurna Czajka and Trina Baker. Another sister, Andra, died before her. In more than 20 years with Pepsi, Ms. Barnes rose from one top job to another, moving from marketing positions to broader management roles until she was named to run the company's giant beverage business in North America in 1996. She gained a reputation for being adept at connecting with workers on the factory floor and for wooing her peers in the boardroom. But the hours were brutal. She often set her alarm for 3:30 a.m., she said, so she could catch up with work at home before rousing the children for school. ""There were two things in my life, kids and job,"" Ms. Barnes told The Christian Science Monitor. ""Exercise? Golf? Sleep? None of that."" Correction: January 24, 2017, Tuesday This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Saturday about the former corporate chief executive Brenda Barnes, using information from her family, misstated the cause of her death. It was complications of a recent stroke, not of a stroke she suffered in 2010."

She was 82 years old.","Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old. Miss Stanwyck's press agent, Larry Kleno, said she died shortly before 5 P.M. at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, where she had been admitted about a week ago. The actress played a rich mix of characterizations in 82 films but developed a distinctive image as a gutsy, self-reliant and self-assured woman whose husky voice and cool exterior usually masked a warm heart. She was a tough-talking but tender-souled mother in ''Stella Dallas'' (1937), a slang-slinging showgirl in ''Ball of Fire'' (1941), a lurid blonde who orchestrates her husband's murder in ''Double Indemnity'' (1944) and a bedridden neurotic who learns from telephone quirks that she is marked for murder in ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' (1948). Miss Stanwyck was nominated for best-actress Academy Awards for all four of those performances but won none. However, in 1982 the Motion Picture Academy awarded her an honorary Oscar for being ''an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress and one of the great ladies of Hollywood.'' A year earlier, she became the eighth person, and second woman, to be honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center for career-long excellence. Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954). Some of Her Other Films Other memorable Stanwyck films were ''The Bitter Tea of General Yen,'' which opened Radio City Music Hall in 1933, ''Annie Oakley'' (1935), ''Banjo on My Knee'' (1936), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Union Pacific'' (1939), ''Golden Boy'' (1939), ''Remember the Night'' (1940), ''The Great Man's Lady'' (1942), ''Lady of Burlesque'' (1943), ''Clash by Night'' (1952) and ''Titanic'' (1953). The actress commanded increasingly higher salaries in the 1930's and early '40's, and in 1944 the Government listed her as the nation's highest-paid woman, earning $400,000. From the mid-1950's on, she lent distinction to a string of otherwise lackluster movies. Turning to televison, she made many guest appearances and then starred in an anthology series, ''The Barbara Stanwyck Show,'' in 1960-61, and the highly popular series ''The Big Valley,'' in which she portrayed a frontier rancher from 1965 to 1969. The two series won her two Emmies and a cluster of other awards. The actress's take-charge, down-to-earth screen image mirrored her childhood as Ruby Stevens, born into a poor family of Scottish-Irish descent in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn on July 16, 1907. When she was 4 years old, her mother was killed when a drunken stranger pushed her off a moving streetcar. The loss devasted her father, a bricklayer, who deserted his five children. They never saw him again. Left School at Age 13 Young Ruby, who had to board with family friends, sought solace by seeing as many movies as her pennies allowed. At the age of 13, she had to leave school to earn a living. She started as a wrapper in a department store and worked in other low-paying clerical jobs while studying dancing with a vaudevillian friend of her family. At 15, Ruby entered show business as a chorus girl, first dancing in speakeasies and soon advancing to Broadway and touring stints in the Ziegfeld Follies and other revues. At 18, she won a leading role as a cabaret dancer in a melodrama, ''The Noose,'' which ran on Broadway for nine months. The program introduced her as Barbara Stanwyck, a glamorous name inspired by a theatrical poster: ''Jane Stanwyck in 'Barbara Frietchie.' '' In 1927, at the age of 20, she won a leading role in the Broadway play ''Burlesque.'' She received good notices, played the part for two years and won nonexclusive contracts with Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers. Her first important movie role was classic Stanwyck - a shallow adventuress redeemed by love in a 1930 melodrama, ''Ladies of Leisure,'' directed by a youthful Frank Capra. 'Beloved by All' Involved Mr. Capra, who also directed her in four later movies, wrote in his 1971 autobography, ''The Name Above the Title,'' that she was unique in not requiring rehearsals because she ''gave her all the first time she tried a scene.'' Her dedication, he wrote, made her ''beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras.'' Miss Stanwyck was also the favorite of Cecil B. De Mille, who wrote, ''I have never worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a better workman, to use my term of highest compliment.'' '' She was also the favorite leading lady of William Holden, Henry Fonda and Robert Preston. Friends and colleagues described the actress as modest, generous and outspoken, and co-workers fondly called her ''Missy.'' If a cameraman she worked with decades earlier was having financial problems, she invariably gave him enough money to ease his troubles. She repeatedly refused to use a double and was seriously injured several times. Miss Stanwyck's hair began silvering in her mid-40's, but she refused to dye it, just as she refused to conceal her age. In a 1981 interview at her longtime Beverly Hills home, she offered this advice: ''You have to know when you've had your hour, your place in the sun. To be old is death here. I think it's kind of silly. Be glad you're healthy. Be glad you can get out of bed on your own.'' Even in her 70's Miss Stanwyck began every day by walking half a mile on an uphill treadmill that dominated her bedroom. Praise for 'Thorn Birds' In the early 1970's the actress became semi-reclusive. But in 1983 she appeared in a television mini-series, ''The Thorn Birds.'' Of her performance as a wealthy Australian who lusts after a young priest, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times concluded, ''When it comes to the big moments, she demonstrates the kind of disarming toughness that made her a major movie star.'' Miss Stanwyck was married twice, to the comedian Frank Fay from 1928 to 1935, and to the actor Robert Taylor from 1939 to 1951. With Mr. Fay, she adopted a son, Dion Anthony Fay. In 1981 she said of her second divorce: ''Losing somebody you love by death or divorce is hard. But if they decide they want to be free, there's nothing to battle for. You have to let go. Bob and I didn't stay friends. We became friends again. Time does take care of things.'' In 1965, Miss Stanwyck and Mr. Taylor co-starred in her last movie, ''The Night Walker.'' Four years later, he died of lung cancer."

Ganong, a former chairman of one of the leading physiology departments at an American university and one of the first scientists to trace how the brain controls important internal functions of the body, died Dec. 23 at his home in Albany, Calif.","William F. Ganong, a former chairman of one of the leading physiology departments at an American university and one of the first scientists to trace how the brain controls important internal functions of the body, died Dec. 23 at his home in Albany, Calif. He was 83. The cause was prostate cancer, his wife, Ruth, said. Dr. Ganong, a neuroendocrinologist, was chairman of the physiology department at the University of California, San Francisco, from 1970 to 1987. When he took over the department, neuroendocrinology -- the science of how hormones and glands interact with the nervous system -- was just becoming part of medical school curriculums. The brain and the body were taught separately, and the basic science of the nervous system ''was still a mystery,'' said Michael Stryker, a professor of physiology and a successor of Dr. Ganong as chairman of the U.C.S.F. physiology department. ''He assembled a department that was regarded as one of the best in the world,'' Dr. Stryker said of Dr. Ganong, ''and its particular strength was neuroscience.'' In 1982 and again in 1986, the U.C.S.F. physiology department was rated first in the nation in a survey by the National Academy of Sciences. Physiology is the study of how the body functions at the levels of organs, cells and molecules. While Dr. Ganong specialized in endocrinology, he believed that medical students needed to understand the science underlying the clinical practice of medicine. He taught classes in all of his department's disciplines, including respiratory medicine, cardiology and neuroscience. He also encouraged faculty members, including scientists he had recruited to do basic research, to teach classes beyond their specialties. At the same time, working in his laboratory, Dr. Ganong made several breakthroughs. Hormones, which are chemical signals from one part of the body to another, control things like digestion, weight regulation, temperature, growth and even moods. Dr. Ganong was one of the first scientists to realize that much of the action of the endocrine system is regulated by the brain. Bruce S. McEwen, director of the neuroendocrinology laboratory at Rockefeller University in New York, said on Friday that Dr. Ganong's major contribution was the discovery of how blood pressure and fluid balance -- the salt and water levels in the body -- are regulated by hormones from the adrenal gland and the kidney. ''This led to some of the current treatments of hypertension,'' Dr. McEwen said. ''He did the basic work, and drug companies developed the drugs.'' Dr. Ganong was also one of the discoverers of Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome, an electrical abnormality that affects heart rhythm. William Francis Ganong, who preferred to be called Fran, was born on July 6, 1924, in Northampton, Mass., one of two children of William and Anna Hobbet Ganong. His father was a doctor, and his mother was a geologist. He entered Harvard in the fall of 1941, but was drafted into the Army after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Under a special wartime program, he began pre-med studies while in the Army. He completed his bachelor's degree at Harvard after the war and received his medical degree there in 1949. Two years later, he was drafted into the Army again and served as a medical officer in Japan and Korea. In 1955, Dr. Ganong was hired as an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Three years later, he moved to the University of California, San Francisco, to help start a research program in physiology. He retired in 1999. Dr. Ganong wrote a textbook that is considered a touchstone in his field. First published in 1963, ''Review of Medical Physiology'' (Lange Medical Publications) is now in its 22nd edition and has been translated into 18 languages. Dr. Stryker, who took over the U.C.S.F. physiology chairmanship in 1994, recalled how he had once become a proxy recipient of the esteem in which Dr. Ganong was held. ''I didn't realize the impact his book had all over the world; medical students everywhere use it,'' Dr. Stryker said. ''When I visited the medical school in Semarang, in Central Java, in 1982 and I mentioned that I knew Dr. Ganong, they actually washed my feet as an honored visitor.''"
60581,"Ed Warner, 73, College Star Convicted of Shaving Points","Ed Warner, who was a star forward for the City College basketball team that won the National Invitation Tournament and N.C.A.A.","Ed Warner, who was a star forward for the City College basketball team that won the National Invitation Tournament and N.C.A.A. tournament championships in 1950 but shattered his career in the point-shaving scandal that engulfed the game, died Saturday at his home in Harlem. He was 73. His death was reported by Charles DeCicco, director of public relations for City College, who said he did not know the cause. In the winter of 1950, City College, ranked nowhere near the top of college basketball's elite, became the only team to capture both major postseason basketball championships in the same season. And the Beavers did it by defeating Bradley, the No. 1 ranked team, in both finals at the game's showplace, Madison Square Garden. First, City College, coached by Nat Holman, known as Mr. Basketball, won the N.I.T., then the nation's most prestigious basketball tournament, by defeating Bradley, 69-61. Warner was named most valuable player of the tournament. After that, City triumphed over Bradley by 71-68 in the N.C.A.A. final. But in 1951, players from powerhouse teams, including City College, Long Island University, Bradley and the University of Kentucky, were arrested. They were charged with taking part in a scandal in which gamblers bribed athletes to either lose games in which they were favored or to keep the margin of victory below the point spread established to attract bettors. In November 1951, Warner, who was among a host of former players sentenced in the fixing, received a six-month term. Warner, who played high school basketball at DeWitt Clinton in the Bronx, was City College's co-captain and second-leading scorer on the double-championship team. He averaged 14.8 points a game in the regular season, as a sophomore, and 21.7 points in the N.I.T. Although often matched against taller players, Warner, at 6 feet 3 inches, used his body well and maneuvered defenders out of position. Warner and others in the scandal were barred from the National Basketball Association, but he and two teammates who were among those involved, Floyd Layne and Ed Roman, often drove together on weekends to play basketball in the Eastern League. ""The scandal formed our bond,"" Warner told Dave Anderson of The New York Times in 1988 at a memorial service for Roman, who died of leukemia at age 57. In the 1960's, Warner was imprisoned after pleading guilty to attempting to sell heroin. ""I had a problem,"" he said. ""I was trying to play Superfly. I got two and a half to four in Greenhaven. But Eddie and Floyd came to see me and when I got out and started refereeing, they would come to see me work. Eddie would laugh and tell me, 'You've got to move more; you're standing on a dime.' "" Warner had worked as a high school basketball referee, but in April 1984 he was partly paralyzed when his automobile was struck from behind in Upper Manhattan. Until last year, he was an observer of officials for New York City's Public Schools Athletic League, and he was also a recreational supervisor in Harlem. Warner is survived by three sons, Dana Warner, Edward Warner Jr. and Kwamee Rozier, all of New York, City College said. Layne was the City College basketball coach in the 1970's and 80's, and Roman earned a doctorate in adolescent psychology. ""We weren't seasoned criminals,"" Warner said of the scandal. ""We didn't receive the guidance we should've. And we weren't the only team doing it. There were several that escaped. But we paid the price."""

He was 88. The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, his wife, Mildred, said. First an employee of the textile workers union, then the rubber workers union, Mr. Glazer, a burly, affable man, marshaled his booming baritone and thumping guitar to rally union loyalists and sympathizers in almost every state and 60 countries. Mr. Glazer, who called himself ''an agitator for all good causes,'' recorded more than 30 albums, wrote a book about labor music, recorded the songs of others and helped recruit a new generation of protest singers. In 1950, Mr. Glazer and the Elm City Four were the first to record a version of the anthem of the civil rights movement, ''We Shall Overcome,'' according to many sources. His version of the song (originally a folk song and then a Baptist hymn before he helped popularize it as a labor union theme) began ''I Will Overcome,'' Mrs. Glazer said. Other sources maintain that Mr. Glazer used the more familiar title, or something close to it, in the recording, made for a two-record 78-r.p.m. set called ''Eight New Songs for Labor.'' It was financed by the Congress of Industrial Organizations before it merged with the American Federation of Labor to form the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in 1955. He wrote his own best-known song, ''The Mills Weren't Made of Marble,'' in 1947. In waltz tempo, it tells of a millworker's dream of a happy heaven where ''nobody ever got tired and nobody ever grew old.'' It became so familiar a piece of Americana that in 1992, The New York Times called it an ''old folk song'' in an editorial about a museum's depiction of the harsh lives of textile workers in the 1800's. Mr. Glazer responded with a letter saying that usually a song is not deemed a folk song until long after the composer's death. He thanked the paper for ''a nice Labor Day present.'' Joseph Glazer was born in Manhattan on June 19, 1918, the son of a tailor in the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Growing up in the Bronx, he adored cowboy crooners like Gene Autry, and imitated them with his guitar. He graduated from Brooklyn College and was hired as a civilian radio instructor by the Army Air Corps after failing his draft physical. In 1942 he married Mildred Krauss, whom he had met at a camp in the Catskills where both were counselors. She said she was impressed by his leading the counselors in a strike. In addition to his wife, Mr. Glazer, who was not related to the folk singer Tom Glazer, is survived by his brother, Nathan, the sociologist, of Cambridge, Mass.; his sister, Gail Klebanoss of Verona, N.J.; his son, Daniel, of Northbrook, Ill.; his daughters Emily Glazer of Silver Spring, Md., and Patti Glazer of Asheville, N.C.; and four grandchildren. The newlyweds settled in Madison, Wis., where Mr. Glazer worked at a military airfield and did graduate work on statistical probability. He found his wife's labor economics courses more captivating, and switched to that field. Mr. Glazer joined the textile workers as an assistant education director and seized upon his boss's suggestion to use a guitar to rally workers. He traveled widely and picked up the early version of ''We Shall Overcome'' from the celebrated Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tenn. It had borrowed the song from black tobacco union workers who sang it on a picket line in 1946. Mr. Glazer used it in organizing mainly white workers, in a film he made in 1950 called ''Unions at Work'' and on a record of his that year. The song's current version was written by Frank Hamilton, Guy Carawan, Pete Seeger and Zilphia Horton and was adopted by demonstrators in the early days of the civil rights sit-ins in 1960 and 1961. Mr. Glazer moved on to the rubber workers union in Akron, Ohio, where he was education director. He also performed for many liberal politicians, particularly Hubert H. Humphrey, then a Minnesota senator. In 1980 President Jimmy Carter invited him to play at the White House. He joined the Kennedy administration in 1961 as a labor information officer for the United States Information Agency, partly because he admired its head, Edward R. Murrow. In addition to explaining America's current events to foreigners, he was frequently sent to foreign countries to sing protest songs. Mr. Glazer resigned from the agency after the inauguration of Ronald Reagan and soon began composing songs, like ''Jellybean Blues,'' satirizing the new president. ''Protest songs use humor, they tell about terrible conditions, but you still have to be able to laugh and sing and tell a joke,'' he told The Times in 1981. ''You know, that's a very important thing -- life goes on.''"

Wauneka, 87, Dies; Navajo Medical Crusader","Annie Dodge Wauneka, who broke custom and became the Navajo Nation's first female legislator and a health crusader, died on Monday at Flagstaff Medical Center in Arizona.","Annie Dodge Wauneka, who broke custom and became the Navajo Nation's first female legislator and a health crusader, died on Monday at Flagstaff Medical Center in Arizona. She was 87 and lived in Klagetoh, in northeast Arizona. The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said Ted Rushton, a spokesman in Window Rock, Ariz., the Navajo capital. For many years starting in the 1950's, Mrs. Wauneka traveled to villages and clinics, covering the 24,000-square-mile territory of the Navajo to preach public health standards. She cut a striking figure, tall and always wearing traditional Navajo clothing, including a colorful shawl and silver jewelry. Over the years, she urged the Navajo to adopt more modern dwellings, and she worked to improve the quality of water on the reservation. She also helped many people obtain medical attention after generations of reliance solely on tradition. She received much of the credit for defeating tuberculosis among the Navajo beginning in the 1950's and received national recognition for her role. Albert A. Hale, president of the Navajo Nation, called her ""our legendary mother"" and ""the most honored Navajo in our history."" He directed all public offices to shut down for one day last week, except for emergency services. Annie Dodge was born in Deer Springs, Ariz., and learned of public service from her father, Henry Chee Dodge, a chief and first president of the Navajo Nation's legislative Tribal Council. Its jurisdiction stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. She became the first woman on the council in 1951, winning an election over two rival candidates. One of those was her husband, George L. Wauneka, with whom she ran a ranch owned by her father in Arizona. Mrs. Wauneka was in the council for nearly 30 years, serving as the chairwoman of the health committee. Her concern with public health could be traced to her grade-school days, when the influenza pandemic at the end of World War I killed many Navajos. She escaped with a mild attack and, even as an 8-year-old, helped the overworked nurse at her school in Fort Defiance, Ariz. Her formal education ended in the 11th grade, when she began tending to the needs of her tribe at the side of her father, who had become head of the Tribal Council and her political mentor. ""From my childhood,"" she said later, ""I have been aware of the problems of my tribe and have wanted to help make our people aware of them."" Among her frustrations were the objections of tribal medicine makers to new ways. She conceded that the medicine makers performed much good work among the people, especially in family matters. But she said: ""The Navajo is caught in between. I must convince them to accept a mixture."" In 1963, Mrs. Wauneka and 30 diplomats, educators, musicians, authors and a former Supreme Court justice received the newly created Presidential Medal of Freedom for service to their country. President John F. Kennedy established the honor on July 4, 1963; after his assassination, the medals were presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Mrs. Wauneka's husband died in 1994. Her survivors include four daughters, Irma Bluehouse, Laurencita Cohoe, Georgia Ann Plummer and Sally S. Wauneka; five sons, Franklin, George L. Jr., Henry Chee, Norman and Timothy; a sister, Ann Shirley, and three brothers, Bernard, Sam and Walter Shirley."

He was 74. The cause was stomach cancer, said David Newell, a family spokesman who also portrayed Mr. McFeely, of the Speedy Delivery Messenger Service, one of the regulars on ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood."" Mr. Rogers entered the realm of children's television with a local show in Pittsburgh in 1954. But it was the daily half-hour ""Neighborhood"" show, which began nationally on public television in 1968 with homemade puppets and a cardboard castle, that caught on as a haven from the hyperactivity of most children's television. Let morphing monsters rampage elsewhere, or educational programs jump up and down for attention; ""Mister Rogers"" stayed the same year after year, a low-key affair without animation or special effects. Fred Rogers was its producer, host and chief puppeteer. He wrote the scripts and songs. Above all he supplied wisdom; and such was the need for it that he became the longest-running attraction on public television and an enduring influence on America's everyday life. For all its reassuring familiarity, ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"" was a revolutionary idea at the outset and it remained a thing apart through all its decades on television. Others would also entertain the young or give them a leg up on their studies. But it was Fred Rogers, the composer, Protestant minister and student of behavior who ventured to deal head-on with the emotional life of children. ""The world is not always a kind place,"" he said. ""That's something all children learn for themselves, whether we want them to or not, but it's something they really need our help to understand."" He believed that even the worst fears had to be ""manageable and mentionable,"" one way or another, and because of this he did not shy away from topics like war, death, poverty and disability. In one classic episode he sat down at the kitchen table, looked straight into the camera and calmly began talking about divorce: ""Did you ever know any grown-ups who got married and then later they got a divorce?"" he asked. And then, after pausing to let that sink in: ""Well, it is something people can talk about, and it's something important. I know a little boy and a little girl whose mother and father got divorced, and those children cried and cried. And you know why? Well, one reason was that they thought it was all their fault. But, of course, it wasn't their fault."" When the Smithsonian Institution put one of Mr. Rogers's zippered sweaters on exhibit in 1984, no one who had grown up with American television would have needed an explanation. He had about two dozen of those cardigans. Many had been knitted by his mother. He wore one every day as part of the comforting ritual that opened the show: Mr. Rogers would come home to his living room -- a set at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh -- and change from a sports coat and loafers into sweater and sneakers as he sang the"

Raff, who led the first combat jump by American paratroopers in World War II and served a decade later as an early commander of the Army's Special Forces, died March 11 in Garnett, Kan.","Col. Edson D. Raff, who led the first combat jump by American paratroopers in World War II and served a decade later as an early commander of the Army's Special Forces, died March 11 in Garnett, Kan. Colonel Raff, who lived in Garnett and Bora-Bora, French Polynesia, was 95. The American paratroopers of World War II were an elite bunch. Colonel Raff, a graduate of West Point, was one of their first commanders, having trained at Fort Benning, Ga., in 1941, when the Army was inaugurating its jump school. On the evening of Nov. 7, 1942, the 556 paratroopers of Colonel Raff's Second Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment, took off from Cornwall in western England for the American airborne's first mission. Flying aboard 39 C-47 transports, the troops were in the vanguard of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. German paratroopers had succeeded in the 1940 invasion of the Low Countries, but Colonel Raff's men were undertaking the longest journey for an airborne invasion that had ever been tried. They were flying 1,600 miles toward two airstrips near Oran, Algeria, that they had been ordered to seize. Many of the planes became lost and missed their objectives, and when Colonel Raff bailed out, he smashed into a large rock, breaking two ribs, and found himself 35 miles from his destination, the Tafaraoui airstrip. By time he arrived there by jeep, it had been taken by troops landed from the sea. Soon Colonel Raff's paratroopers teamed up with British engineers, a small American anti-tank unit and lightly armed French troops to harass German forces in Tunisia, although greatly outnumbered. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had been the Allied commander for the North African invasion, called Colonel Raff's exploits in Tunisia ""a minor epic."" ""The deceptions he practiced, the speed with which he struck, his boldness and his aggressiveness, kept the enemy completely confused during a period of weeks,"" the general wrote in ""Crusade in Europe"" (Doubleday, 1948). Colonel Raff told of his early airborne experiences in ""We Jumped to Fight"" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1944). He trained paratroopers for the invasion of Normandy, then commanded an armored task force that landed at Utah Beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944. The next winter, Colonel Raff commanded the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment in the Battle of the Bulge. On March 24, 1945, Colonel Raff became the first American paratrooper to jump into Germany east of the Rhine, leading his regiment in Operation Varsity, the last large-scale American airborne drop of the war in Europe. His paratroopers landed near Wesel, then took part in the capture of Essen and Duisburg. Edson Duncan Raff was born on Nov. 15, 1907, in New York City. He graduated from West Point in 1933 with a concentration in mathematics. After World War II, Colonel Raff turned to another aspect of unconventional warfare. In the 1950's, he commanded the 77th Special Forces Group, Airborne, and the Psychological Warfare Center, both at Fort Bragg, N.C. He was an early proponent of having Special Forces troops wear green berets, despite the Army's opposition on the ground that the berets carried a foreign flavor and seemed elitist. In 1961 the Special Forces obtained formal Army approval for their green berets, thereby gaining their informal name. Colonel Raff retired from the military in 1958. He was awarded the Legion of Merit and the silver and bronze stars, and was a member of the French Legion of Honor. He is survived by his wife, Alomah Make of Bora-Bora; a son, James, of Greenville, S.C.; a daughter, Leila Boyer, of Harrisonburg, Va.; a brother, Herbert, of New York City; 10 grandchildren; and 2 great-grandchildren. His first marriage, to Virginia Chaney, ended in divorce."

50731,"Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, Jewish Pioneer, Dies at 89","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, who was considered the spiritual father of the Jewish Renewal movement -- an influential camp of religious pioneers who reintroduced to synagogue services ancient Judaic traditions of mysticism and meditation, gender equality and ecstatic prayer -- died on Thursday at his home in Boulder, Colo.","Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, who was considered the spiritual father of the Jewish Renewal movement -- an influential camp of religious pioneers who reintroduced to synagogue services ancient Judaic traditions of mysticism and meditation, gender equality and ecstatic prayer -- died on Thursday at his home in Boulder, Colo. He was 89. His death was announced by Aleph, an umbrella organization that represents about 40 Jewish Renewal congregations around the world, most of them in North America. Rabbi Schachter-Shalomi's strain of Judaism had its roots in Chabad-Lubavitch, a branch of Hasidism that itself began as a revival movement in 18th-century Russia, drawing ideas from mystical Judaic texts like the kabbalah. But he traced the spark for his renewal movement to the intellectual and spiritual ferment he encountered on American college campuses in the 1960s. As an ordained rabbi of the Lubavitch movement, which sends emissaries around the world to keep the Jewish faith alive, he was dispatched to meet with secularized Jewish students throughout the Northeast. Along the way, he befriended fellow spiritual seekers like the psychedelic guru Timothy Leary, the Roman Catholic mystic Thomas Merton and Ram Dass (born Richard Alpert), an educator and proponent of hallucinogens and Hinduism. His exposure to Eastern religion, medieval Christian mysticism and LSD -- he had the first of a handful of hallucinogenic experiences in 1962, under Leary's tutelage -- helped him formulate some of the innovations he brought to contemporary Jewish practice. From his LSD experience in particular he concluded that ''what I'd experienced in prayer and meditation before -- the oneness and connection with God -- was true, but it wasn't just Jewish,'' he told the writer Sara Davidson, author of ''The December Project: An Extraordinary Rabbi and a Skeptical Seeker Confront Life's Greatest Mystery,'' a book, published this year, about her conversations with Rabbi Schachter-Shalomi on aging and mortality. ''I realized that all forms of religion are masks that the divine wears to communicate with us,'' Ms. Davidson quoted him as saying. ''Behind all religions there's a reality, and this reality wears whatever clothes it needs to speak to a particular people.'' The Chabad-Lubavitch movement began distancing itself from Rabbi Schachter-Shalomi later in the 1960s, when he publicly praised what he called ''the sacramental value of lysergic acid'' -- the basic ingredient of LSD -- in a question-and-answer session after a lecture. By then he was introducing college audiences and members of a congregation he led in Somerville, Mass., to Judaism's spiritual traditions of meditation, mysticism and devekut, a form of ecstatic prayer that incorporates singing, dancing and storytelling. He began translating Hasidic mystical texts into English. At the same time he formed a separate movement, P'nai Or (Faces of Light), which helped revive interest in the kabbalah among Jews and non-Jews alike. Accused of promoting a fad rather than a faith, he described his purpose as twofold: to enliven rituals that many young American Jews found stultifying, and to help restore what he considered Judaism's lost legacy of ecstatic spirituality. Underlying both goals was a conviction that Jewishness had to evolve. ''It can't be the same Judaism as it was before,'' he said in a videotaped interview in 2010 with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. ''It has to come to terms with the emerging times.'' His services took a less formulaic approach, offering a deeper spiritual experience to congregants while demanding a greater commitment to social justice and environmental activism. Some of his teachings and methods have been adopted to a greater or lesser degree by Reconstructionist, Reform and Conservative congregations. Rabbi Schachter-Shalomi became known for his ecumenical dialogue with Buddhists. In 1990, he was among a group of Jewish leaders invited to meet with the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India. Living in exile since 1959, the Dalai Lama sought their advice on how to keep his religious tradition alive in the Tibetan diaspora. His outreach to women was also groundbreaking. Citing a word that appears in early Jewish texts, ''Shekhinah,'' which is said to signify the feminine element in God's presence, Rabbi Schachter-Shalomi advocated equality for men and women in all aspects of Jewish services. And he was among the first leaders of any Jewish denomination to ordain women as rabbis and to advocate full participation by gay and lesbian congregants. In 1993, his P'nai Or movement merged with a progressive Jewish political and environmental action group, the Shalom Center, founded by Rabbi Arthur Waskow, to form Aleph, the Alliance for Jewish Renewal, based in Philadelphia. Its seminary has ordained 80 rabbis since 1993. Meshullam Zalman Schachter was born on Aug. 17, 1924, to Shlomo and Hayyah Gittel Schachter in Zholkiew, a city that was then in Poland and is now part of Ukraine. He was raised in Vienna, where his father, a member of the Hasidic sect, was immersed in both Orthodox Judaism and the intellectual and political life of the city. With the rise of the Nazis, the family moved repeatedly -- to Belgium, France, North Africa and the Caribbean -- before landing in New York City in 1941. In 1956, Rabbi Schachter-Shalomi received a master's degree in the psychology of religion from Boston University while serving as a congregational rabbi in New Bedford, Mass. After his estrangement from the Lubavitchers, he received a Ph.D. in theology from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, a Reform institution in Manhattan. From 1975 to 1995 he was a professor of Jewish mysticism and the psychology of religion at Temple University in Philadelphia. He later joined Naropa University, a Buddhist institution, in Boulder, where he received an appointment to the World Wisdom Chair, a lecturer position. He is survived by his wife, Eve Ilsen. Married four times, he is also survived by 11 children. The author Rodger Kamenetz, whose 1994 book, ''The Jew in the Lotus,'' chronicled the rabbis' meeting with the Dalai Lama, said Rabbi Schachter-Shalomi was always pained by his estrangement from the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. And, he added, he was never comfortable with the nicknames that both Jewish and secular news media gave him: the hippie rabbi, the cyber rabbi (for his technological savvy), the gadfly rabbi. Mr. Kamenetz said the rabbi was philosophically averse to labels and the blanket prejudices they stood for. ''He was a guy who saw each person as a being unto itself, who treated every human being as if he or she had the potential to be holy,'' he said. ''He was incapable of an impersonal thought.''"

She was 89 years old. Born in Charleston, the daughter of a former slave, Mrs. Clark was widely recognized for her work in civil rights. In 1964 she accompanied the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Norway when he was presented the Nobel Peace Prize. ''The state has lost not only a leading civil rights activist but a legendary educator and humanitarian,'' Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. said today. Mrs. Clark attended Avery Institute in Charleston, and received a bachelor's degree from Benedict College in Columbia and a master's degree from Hampton Institute in Virginia. Worked in Teacher Campaign She began her teaching career at a black public school on John's Island and, in 1918, accepted a teaching post at Avery. That year, she was instrumental in getting about 20,000 signatures on a petition to have black teachers hired by the Charleston County School District. Mrs. Clark moved to Columbia in 1927 to teach and helped in a campaign to equalize teacher salaries. She later was dismissed from a teaching job in Charleston for being a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. In the late 1950's she worked at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, where she developed a program to teach blacks to read and write well enough to pass voter literacy tests. She lectured around the country and later became a director of the school and a supervisor of teacher training for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Her autobiography, ''Echo In My Soul,'' was published in 1962. In 1974, Mrs. Clark was elected to the Charleston County School Board. Mrs. Clark received a Living Legacy Award from President Carter in 1979 and the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina's highest civilian award, in 1982. She is survived by a son, Nerie D. Clark Jr., of Hickory, N.C., a sister and two brothers."
15472,"Nikolai Andrianov, 58, Gymnastics Icon, Dies","Nikolai Andrianov, the record-setting Russian gymnast who had won more Olympic medals than any other male athlete before the swimmer Michael Phelps passed him, died Monday in Vladimir, Russia.","Nikolai Andrianov, the record-setting Russian gymnast who had won more Olympic medals than any other male athlete before the swimmer Michael Phelps passed him, died Monday in Vladimir, Russia. He was 58. The International Gymnastics Federation in Lausanne, Switzerland, announced his death, citing a degenerative nerve disease that had robbed him of his ability to speak and to move his arms and legs. Immensely powerful in the upper body and with a gift for leaping quickly off the floor, Andrianov was especially strong in the rings and floor exercises, but over three Summer Olympics --Munich in 1972, Montreal in 1976 and Moscow in 1980 -- his 15 medals, seven of them gold, included at least one in all four of the other gymnastic events as well: the vault, pommel horse, parallel bars and horizontal bar. Andrianov was the 1976 Olympic all-around champion and the silver medalist in the 1980 all-around competition. Only the Soviet women's gymnast Larissa Latynina, who won 18 medals in the 1956, 1960 and 1964 games, and Phelps, who won eight medals for the United States in Beijing in 2008, bringing his total to 16, have won more Olympic medals. ''He was good on everything,'' said Peter Vidmar, a three-medal winner at the 1984 Olympics who is now the chairman of USA Gymnastics, the governing body of the sport in America. ''He was not the most flexible athlete on the floor, which was unusual because the Russians were typically considered the artists. But he was really consistent, and very, very strong, with almost a barrel chest. There wasn't one event where he was the best in the world, but if he hit, he was going to win.'' Beyond his physical gifts and technical mastery, however, he was known for his courage and the kind of bravado attributed to fighter pilots and astronauts -- ''the right stuff,'' in the writer Tom Wolfe's phrase. He pushed other gymnasts to match his feats -- attempting triple back flip dismounts from the rings, for example, when everyone else was doing doubles. He also enjoyed his cigarettes and vodka. ''He was one of the toughest gymnasts I've ever seen,'' said Bart Conner, who competed against Andrianov in the late 1970s and went on to win two gold medals in the 1984 Summer Olympics. ''Flat-out tough.'' Nikolai Yefimovich Andrianov was born in Vladimir, east of Moscow, on Oct. 14, 1952, one of four children raised by a single mother after his father abandoned the family. He grew up poor and was something of a hoodlum, headed for trouble before he was rescued by gymnastics in general and a coach, Nikolai Tolkachev, in particular. He earned a place on the Soviet national team in 1970 and won his first medals in international competition -- including two golds, in pommel horse and vault -- at the European Championships in 1971. The next year, he was the all-around champion of the Soviet Union. At the 1972 Summer Olympics, at age 19, Andrianov won a gold in floor exercises, a bronze in the vault and a silver in the team combined competition. His finest hour came at the 1976 Games, when he won seven medals, including gold in the floor exercises, rings, vault and all-around. In 1980 he added five more medals, including a gold in the vault. In 1978, he was the all-around winner at the world championships. After his retirement from competition, Andrianov was an international judge and a coach in the Soviet Union and, later, in Japan. In the 1980s, he coached the Soviet junior team, where his prize pupil was Vitaly Scherbo, who went on to win six out of eight possible gold medals at the 1992 Summer Olympics, the greatest performance ever by a gymnast at an Olympics. Scherbo said in an interview Tuesday that Andrianov, perhaps owing to his own rugged upbringing, helped him cope with his own worst instincts and once persuaded the coach of the Soviet national team to reinstate him after he had been suspended, threatening his future. ''He was my mentor,'' Scherbo, who now runs a gymnastics school in Las Vegas, said of Andrianov. ''He taught me how to concentrate, to keep myself inside myself. He is the man who made my gymnastics life.'' Andrianov's survivors include his wife, Lyubov Burda, also a world-class gymnast, whom he married in 1973, and two sons. ''His contributions were immeasurable,'' said Conner, now the president of the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City. ''There's a fellowship, a brotherhood of these athletes, and we appreciated the artistry of a classical gymnast, but we were most in awe of a guy who would cut for a triple back flip off the rings when nobody else would go for it. In our little fraternity, we hold all these layers of respect, and to a man, gymnasts say, 'That guy was a stud!' ''"

Robinson, the former president of Glassboro State College and unsuspecting host of an unsuspected East-West summit meeting in rural southern New Jersey in 1967, died on Wednesday at St. Mary's Hospital in Langhorne, Pa.","Dr. Thomas E. Robinson, the former president of Glassboro State College and unsuspecting host of an unsuspected East-West summit meeting in rural southern New Jersey in 1967, died on Wednesday at St. Mary's Hospital in Langhorne, Pa. He was 87 years old and lived in Holland, Pa. He died after a heart attack, the college reported. Dr. Robinson, a Latin scholar, was the third head of the college, which started as Glassboro Normal College in 1923. Under his leadership from 1952 to 1969, it grew by leaps and bounds. Whereas there had been no construction for 26 years, Dr. Robinson became known as the ""Building President"" who made Glassboro grow from five buildings to 27. Student enrollment rose from 400 to more than 3,500, with a faculty to match. Enriching its curriculum, Glassboro Teachers College became Glassboro State College and aspired to educational excellence. Its fine-arts summer program began to attract students from all over the country. Built Tennis Courts Under his direction, the college's adult center gained national acclaim with its work among migrant farm workers, illiterate adults and poor youths. An avid tennis player, he built courts on the 175-acre campus. He was a founder of the Delsea Tennis Club. But it was the surprise American-Soviet summit meeting of June 1967 that brought Glassboro to the nation's attention. Prime Minister Aleksei N. Kosygin was in New York for a special session of the United Nations when President Lyndon B. Johnson suggested a meeting, preferably in Washington with Camp David a possible alternative. Glassboro, lying about halfway between New York and Washington, became a compromise offered by Gov. Richard J. Hughes of New Jersey. As Dr. Robinson put it at the time, ""I learned about it when it came over the radio."" His official brown-fieldstone residence, Hollybush, was refurbished overnight and, because of a heat wave, 16 air-conditioning units were installed by the State Department. Air-conditioning at Hollybush was something Dr. Robinson had wanted for some time. Thousands turned out to give the summiteers a tumultuous welcome. At the end, Mr. Kosygin repaid Dr. Robinson's hopitality by giving him and his wife a silver samovar and other gifts, including a paperweight made of Baltic amber. Dr. Robinson now became known around Glassboro as the ""Summit President"" and got President Johnson to deliver the commencement address the following spring. Thomas Edmond Robinson was born in Trenton. He graduated from Lehigh University with a Latin major and earned a master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania and a doctorate at Rutgers University. He taught Latin and English in junior high and high school in Trenton and was an elementary school principal, high school principal and Mercer County Superintendent of Schools before taking over at Glassboro. On Sept. 1, the college became Rowan College of New Jersey in recognition of a $100 million donation made by Henry M. and Betty Rowan, the largest such individual gift ever to benefit a public college or university. Dr. Robinson is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Margaret Bay; A son, Timothy Bay Robinson of Ridgewood, N.J., and four grandchildren."

12925,"Reginald Goodall, 84, Conductor Who Mastered Wagner, Is Dead","Sir Reginald Goodall, sometimes called the last link in a chain of legendary Wagnerian conductors stretching back to Wagner himself, died on Saturday in a nursing home near Canterbury, England.","Sir Reginald Goodall, sometimes called the last link in a chain of legendary Wagnerian conductors stretching back to Wagner himself, died on Saturday in a nursing home near Canterbury, England. He was 84 years old. The Associated Press, which reported the death from London, said the cause was not announced. As he reached the height of his fame in the 1970's, the response of British music critics and operagoers to Sir Reginald's Wagner interpretations was just short of idolatrous. The triumph of his life's work became the Ring Cycle he performed and recorded in Andrew Porter's English translation for the Sadler's Wells Opera. Even so, he never became principal conductor of a leading orchestra or opera house. Demands and Timidity Part of the reason was that companies could not afford the rehearsal time he demanded to bring his understanding of Wagner's total theater to fruition. Another part was his own reclusive, even timid, nature that made him shun the rough-and-ready world of repertory opera. Indeed, he spent much of his career coaching, which became apparent when he was given the chance to shape a body of singers and players into a single instrument that would reveal his intentions whole to the audience. After working for nearly two decades at Covent Garden, Sir Reginald got his break in 1945 conducting the first performance of Benjamin Britten's ''Peter Grimes,'' which reopened the Sadler's Wells Theater. The following year, he helped in introducing Britten's ''The Rape of Lucretia'' at Glyndebourne. He then returned for an additional 15 years as a staff conductor at Covent Garden, the Royal Opera House. He conducted numerous repertory performances. The arrival of Georg Solti at Covent Garden in 1961 again relegated Sir Reginald to a secondary role. Move to Sadler's Wells But in 1967, Sadler's Wells at the Coliseum - now known as the English National Opera and to Covent Garden what the New York City Opera is to the Metropolitan - invited him to conduct a new production of ''Die Meistersinger.'' The company had remembered his way with the works he loved by Wagner and Bruckner. And his success with ''Die Meistersinger'' in turn led to his involvement with the Ring. It began with one opera a season in 1970 and built to two performances of the entire cycle in 1973. His presentation was the highlight of London's musical offerings that summer. John Rockwell, a music critic of The New York Times, reported that Sir Reginald's success was nothing short of triumphant. Critics hailed him as the last surviving successor of such giants as Wilhelm Furtwangler and Hans Knappertsbusch. Sir Reginald's Ring generally was lauded as better than anything Bayreuth had to offer that year. The British opera critic Rodney Milnes observed, ''All the conductors with whom he is to be compared are dead.'' Frail but Commanding Sir Reginald led a new, sold-out production of ''Tristan and Isolde'' for the English National Opera in 1985, again in Andrew Porter's translation. Looking old and frail during a single furtive curtain call, Sir Reginald nonetheless conducted ''authoritatively,'' Mr. Rockwell reported. Reginald Goodall was born July 13, 1905, in the cathedral town of Lincoln in northeastern England. He studied conducting and the piano at the Royal College of Music and then haunted the musical meccas of Germany and Austria to observe the premier conductors of the day while supporting himself as a piano accompanist. His first appointment was as choirmaster and organist at St. Alban's, Holborn, a borough of London. In the late 1930's, he started work as an assistant to Albert Coates at Covent Garden in the late 1930's and with the Royal Choral Society under Malcolm Sargent. Sir Reginald, who was knighted in 1985, gave his final peformance at the 1987 Promenade Concerts in London, conducting Act III of ''Parsifal.'' He was married to Eleanor Gibbs in 1932. There are no known survivors."

Mr. Stevenson, an avid swimmer and surfer, thought he could do better. He began building boards shaped like surfboards in his garage, and sure enough, they offered a superior ride. By 1963, demand was so high he created a company to mass-produce them, Makaha, named for a famous Hawaiian surf beach. His designs revolutionized skateboarding. Mr. Stevenson died on Sunday in an assisted-living facility in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 81. The cause was pneumonia, resulting from complications of Parkinson's disease, his son, Curtis, said. Mr. Stevenson promoted Makaha skateboards in Surf Guide, a surfing magazine he published, with photos of professional surfers riding his boards. Makaha became one of the first skateboard companies to make a professional model, for the surfer Phil Edwards, and the first to use clay wheels rather than steel, providing a smoother ride and more maneuverability. ''There were skateboards before Larry Stevenson came along, but he made them better. He professionalized them,'' said Michael Brooke, who wrote a history of skateboarding called ''The Concrete Wave'' in 1999. In 1969 Mr. Stevenson introduced the kicktail, in which the rear of the board was curved up, enabling a skateboarder to launch the board off the ground with his feet. Without the kicktail, the aerial maneuvers that define contemporary skateboarding would be impossible. Mr. Stevenson received the patent for the kicktail in 1971 but was unable to compel most companies to pay royalties. The kicktail shape is now ubiquitous; most current boards feature two, one on the nose and one on the tail. Mr. Stevenson also patented the idea of kicktails at each end. Richard Lawrence Stevenson was born on Dec. 22, 1930, in Los Angeles. He graduated from Venice High School and then served in the Navy during the Korean War. He graduated from the University of Southern California with a bachelor's degree in business. Mr. Stevenson is survived by his son. His marriage to the former Helen Payne ended in divorce. During the skateboarding booms in the 1960s and '70s, Makaha sold hundreds of thousands of boards a year. Shawn Bryant, the manager of Makaha L.L.C., said current sales were at least 2,000 a month."

43328,JAMES ROBERT KNOX; AUSTRALIAN CARDINAL WAS VATICAN ENVOY,"James Robert Cardinal Knox, a senior Vatican administrator and diplomat, died today in a hospital here.","ROME, June 26 James Robert Cardinal Knox, a senior Vatican administrator and diplomat, died today in a hospital here. He was 69 years old and suffered a stroke last month. Cardinal Knox was Archbishop of Melbourne from 1967 until 1974. He was named a Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1973 and appointed head of the Vatican department in charge of the liturgy a year later. He was also appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Cult. Two years ago, Pope John Paul II appointed Cardinal Knox to head the Pontifical Council for the Family. The Pope visited the Cardinal in the hospital last month. The son of Irish immigrants to western Australia, Cardinal Knox was a tailor's apprentice when he decided to study for the priesthood. He was ordained in Rome in 1941, after five years of study of theology and canon law. The outbreak of World War II, in which Italy and Australia were on opposing sides, prevented his return home and he remained here as a teacher. Entered Diplomatic Service In 1948, Msgr. Giovanni Battista Montini, later to become Pope Paul VI, brought him into the diplomatic service while he served as an assistant to the Vatican's Secretary of State. The future Cardinal received his first foreign assignment in 1950, as secretary to the Apostolic Delegate in Tokyo. Three years later, Pope Pius XII named him a bishop and appointed him Apostolic Delegate to what was then British East Africa, based in Mombasa, Kenya. He was transferred to New Delhi in 1957, serving simultaneously as principal Vatican diplomat in Burma and Ceylon, as Sri Lanka was then called. He held these posts until he was placed in charge of the archidiocese of Melbourne. Because of Cardinal Knox's varied experience, he held an unusually high number of memberships on Vatican congregations, commissions and councils, including those for public affairs, the Eastern churches, education, the bishops, revision of canon law and the administration of Vatican properties. Cardinal Knox's death reduces the members of the college of cardinals to 134, of whom 112 are younger than 80 and thus entitled to vote for a new Pope."

He was 58. The cause was a heart attack, said Liese Rugo, a music publicist. Buffalo Springfield existed only about two years and had a solitary hit single, ''For What It's Worth,'' in 1967. But subsequent critical acclaim and the commercial success of its alumni earned the group an almost mythical status in pop music history. ''Apart from the Byrds, no other American band has had as great an impact on folk-rock and country-rock really, the entire California rock sound, than Buffalo Springfield,'' the Web site of the reference work All Music Guide, allmusic.com, said. Indeed, the lyrics of ''For What It's Worth,'' written by Stephen Stills, became emblematic of the era's chasm between generations. ''Something's happening here, what it is ain't exactly clear,'' is followed by the chorus, ''Stop, hey, what's that sound, everybody look what's going down.'' Mr. Palmer did not write music or lyrics, but many considered his forceful, distinctive bass an important part of the group's identity. The other members of the band were Mr. Stills, on guitar and vocals; Neil Young, guitar and vocals; Dewey Martin, drums and vocals; and Richie Furay, guitar and vocals. Ms. Rugo said that Mr. Palmer was born on Sept. 9, 1946, in Toronto, although some other sources say he was born in Nova Scotia. His father was a concert pianist, and he picked up a guitar at the age of 10 in a music store. He began playing with rock groups in Toronto, including the Swinging Doors and Jack London and the Sparrows. He was next a member of the Mynah Birds, a now-legendary Canadian group whose lead singer was the future funk star Rick James. Mr. Palmer persuaded his friend Mr. Young to join the group, and the Mynah Birds recorded a record for Motown. Their contract was canceled, however, after Mr. James was arrested as a draft dodger. Mr. Young and Mr. Palmer set out for California in Mr. Young's 1953 Pontiac hearse, nicknamed Mort, hoping to find Mr. Stills. They arrived on April Fool's Day 1966, and five days later, in one of rock music's dearest legends, they bumped into Mr. Stills and Mr. Furay in a traffic jam on Sunset Boulevard. Mr. Martin, an experienced session drummer, was recruited, and Buffalo Springfield, named for a brand of steamroller, was formed. ''The whole thing happened at hyper speed, warp drive,'' Mr. Palmer said in an interview with the magazine Goldmine in 1987. By July 1966, they were in Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles working on their first album, ''Buffalo Springfield.'' In 1967, that album was reissued to add ''For What It's Worth,'' and ''Buffalo Springfield Again'' was recorded. The group soon began to unravel because of drug indictments and artistic disagreements. Mr. Palmer faced marijuana and immigration charges that forced him out of the band temporarily, and permanently by the time of Buffalo Springfield's third album, ''Last Time Around.'' He was replaced by Jim Messina in 1968, the year the group disbanded. Mr. Palmer made a solo instrumental album in 1968, played on several occasions with Mr. Young in the 1980's, and reunited with Mr. Martin to form Buffalo Springfield Revisited. Mr. Palmer is survived by his wife, Jill Vanderveen Palmer, and three grown daughters."

20749,"Fred Pressman, Who Elevated Barneys New York, Dies at 73","Fred Pressman, the man who transformed Barneys New York from a men's discount suit shop into a repository of cutting edge designer fashions, died yesterday at his home in Harrison, N.Y.","Fred Pressman, the man who transformed Barneys New York from a men's discount suit shop into a repository of cutting edge designer fashions, died yesterday at his home in Harrison, N.Y. He was 73 years old. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Phyllis. Mr. Pressman took the helm of Barneys in the late 1950's from his father, Barney Pressman, who in 1923 scraped together money for the lease of the store at 17th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan by pawning his wife's engagement ring. With his father's blessing, Fred Pressman slowly transformed the store from a salty discount house that sold roast beef sandwiches in its pub to a purveyor of Italian designers with a cafe serving Perrier and light salads. He began to discard the types of suits that his father was prone to unearthing at auctions and bankruptcy sales, peppering the racks instead with then-obscure and top-name designers both, but continued to offer touches like free alterations that gave Barneys its reputation. By 1968, Barney's had put together a large selection of international designers in five floors of what it called its International House. Women's clothing was added later, as were elegant housewares, unique cosmetics and gifts. Fred Pressman's young sons, Gene and Bob, joined the business in the 1970's, and they further advanced the store into a singular house of urban chic, where wealthy hipsters could take pleasure in a $60 bath towel. An entire women's floor was added in 1981, with the same sensibility. In the late 1980's, Mr. Pressman oversaw the opening of a small store in the World Financial Center. Barneys also started a partnership with the Isetan Company, a Japanese retail giant, to expand the Barneys name globally. That relationship would eventually sour after Bob and Gene Pressman took more control of the company, though Mr. Pressman remained its chairman and continued to be active in its operations. The brothers continued to expand, opening big stores on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, in Chicago and in Beverly Hills, Calif., and several smaller stores around the country. Barney's Inc., the parent company of Barneys New York, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, entangled in a battle with its Japanese partner over the future of the company. Despite the company's financial problems, a discreet jet black Barneys shopping bag continues to say as much about a shopper as her shoes or address. Mr. Pressman was born in New York, and attended Rutgers University before enlisting in the Army. He joined the family store in 1946. During his tenure, Mr. Pressman was almost obsessed with ferreting out quality goods and innovative fashion from around the world, and marketing them in a way that was fresh and often quirky. In the 1960's, long before ironic advertising became mainstream, Mr. Pressman helped conceive a newspaper advertising campaign that featured men in their underwear cleaning their Barney's wash-and-wear suits in a laundromat. Mr. Pressman best enjoyed opening a new store, analyzing which type of lighting would be best, and instructing employees how to arrange ties on a display table. He was known to stare intently at a shoe or jacket lapel until it clicked in his mind what needed to be changed about it. He often traveled to Britain, where tailors along Savile Row, whom he had guided in the softening of their constructions to better please an American audience, would chat him up. He was widely credited within the industry for introducing Giorgio Armani to the American shopper in 1976, and earlier teamed up with Hubert de Givenchy and Pierre Cardin to give New York men a taste of European style when it was unfashionable to do so. Indeed, a basic flannel or pinstripe suit was the mark of many New York professional men during the 1960's and 70's, and Mr. Pressman tried to turn their attention to world designs. ""He was a gentleman,"" the Italian designer Luciano Barbera said in a telephone interview from Milan, Italy. ""I considered him one of my best friends at the highest level. Shaking hands was our way of doing business."" His views on clothing were well known -- he spoke dismissively of suits made in Korea -- and he could give an extemporaneous primer on the merits and markings of a good silk tie, a pair of English shoes or a men's jacket. Admired and envied by his competitors for his fine merchandising savvy, Mr. Pressman once told a reporter that retailing was ""products and merchandise, not merchandising from ledger books, but from the feel of fabric and instinct."" ""The best value you can offer a customer is personal attention to every detail, and they will return again and again,"" Mr. Pressman said. ""Ultimately, the customer cares the most about how he or she is treated."" Barneys, for better or worse, has always been a family business, with decisions often made in ""board meetings"" over a dinner table. Mr. Pressman was known to prefer it this way, and said that he preferred family input over that of an outside investor. ""I recall him always thinking of his family,"" Mr. Barbera said. ""His most important wishes for his weekend time was to be with them."" In addition to his wife, Phyllis, he is survived by his sons, Bob of Greenwich, Conn., and Gene of Larchmont, N.Y.; his daughters, Elizabeth, of Rye, N.Y., and Nancy, of Harrison, N.Y., and 10 grandchildren."

Mr. Martinuzzi was born in Venice and educated in Switzerland and later at the University of Padua in Italy. He began his career at the United States Consulate in Venice during World War I and came to the United States after the war, working as an agent for the Treasury Department. Mr. Martinuzzi soon moved to Rome, and in the 1920's met Percy Straus, whose family owned Macy's, the department store chain based in New York. Mr. Straus offered Mr. Martinuzzi a job running the company's Florence office. For 36 years, Mr. Martinuzzi was involved in foreign buying for the company. In 1931, he moved to England, and until the outbreak of World War II headed Macy's London office. Mr. Martinuzzi moved back to the United States after the war began and became an American citizen. Mr. Martinuzzi continued his foreign buying operations for Macy's after the war, and in December 1950 was named a corporate vice president in charge of the company's foreign offices. For a time, he had similar duties for the May Company. He was also a consultant on export promotion programs for the United States Government and foreign governments, including Britain, Italy, Japan and India. During the Eisenhower Administration, he advised on the construction of a model house to be shown at a trade show in Moscow. It was in the kitchen of that house that a famous debate between Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev took place.

A star quarterback at Vanderbilt University, Wade was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the 1952 draft and, after serving two years in the Navy, played 13 seasons in the N.F.L. He threw for 124 touchdowns and 18,530 yards while playing for the Rams from 1954 to 1960 and for the Bears from 1961 to 1966. He also rushed for 1,334 yards and 24 touchdowns. He threw for 2,301 yards and 15 touchdowns in the Bears' 1963 championship season, and rushed for the Bears' two touchdowns as they defeated the Giants, 14-10, in the title game. Wade, the son of W. J. Wade, a captain of a Vanderbilt team that went 7-0-1 in 1921, played for Vanderbilt from 1949 to 1951.

He was 68 years old. Mr. Foxx collapsed during a rehearsal for the CBS series ""The Royal Family,"" in which he and Della Reese co-starred. The series had its premiere on Sept. 18. He died at Queen of Angels Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said early today. While Mr. Foxx was best known as the bow-legged, raspy-voiced star of ""Sanford and Son,"" which ran from 1972 to 1977, he had had a long career on the black theater and cabaret circuit, where he was known as the dean of X-rated comedians. X-Rated Party Records Long before Richard Pryor and others began skewering social taboos about sex, race and other delicate topics, Mr. Foxx was playing nightclubs and making 54 ""party records"" -- spoken comedy with no music -- a genre he claimed to have originated in 1956. ""No one expected me to be on television because I had a reputation from the party records as X-rated, but that's the type of humor I liked,"" Mr. Foxx said in an interview in 1982. ""That's the humor I heard in the ghettos. They didn't pull no punches, and they didn't want to hear about Little Boy Blue and Cinderella. So I gave them what they wanted. I busted loose."" Mr. Foxx, whose real name was John Sanford, was born in St. Louis and grew up in Chicago. The family was poor, and his father left home. Mr. Foxx ran away when he was 13. Even earlier, though, he had decided that he wanted to work in show business. When he was 7, he would tell jokes to relatives and friends. He began professional work as a teen-ager, playing in a washtub band on street corners and later moving to the black vaudeville circuit. Jail for Minor Offenses Success did not come easily. Mr. Foxx spent a considerable amount of time working as a dishwasher or sign painter in order to eat. For some years, show business dates alternated with brief jail sentences for such offenses as stealing a bottle of milk and sleeping in a hallway. With the first of his party records, in 1956, Mr. Foxx began to be heard by larger audiences. He was a bridge between a decades-old burlesque-show tradition of scatological party humor and a younger generation of comics and social satirists from Lenny Bruce to Andrew Dice Clay. It was not until the late 1960's that Mr. Foxx moved from black clubs to television and to clubs in Las Vegas, where he lived for many years. Mr. Foxx repeated his role as Fred Sanford in a series that ran in 1980 and 81. He starred in another comedy show in 1986, but nothing ever achieved the popularity of his first series, which also starred Demond Wilson as his son, Lamont. Despite his popular and financial success, Mr. Foxx often expressed bitterness about his career. He felt that he had been exploited by unscrupulous associates and victimized by racism in the entertainment industry. ""I've been cheated more than most people because I'm gullible and I'm a target,"" he said. ""My heart is open, and I listen to people and I believe their sob stories."""
22791,"Gilbert E. Kaplan, Publisher and Improbable Symphony Conductor, 74, Dies","Gilbert E. Kaplan, a financial publisher who had an accidental second career as an international symphony conductor -- despite the fact that he could scarcely read music and possessed a concert repertoire of exactly one piece -- died on New Year's Day in Manhattan.","Gilbert E. Kaplan, a financial publisher who had an accidental second career as an international symphony conductor -- despite the fact that he could scarcely read music and possessed a concert repertoire of exactly one piece -- died on New Year's Day in Manhattan. He was 74. The cause was cancer, his daughter Emily Kaplan said. Originally trained as an economist, Mr. Kaplan was the founder and longtime chief executive of Institutional Investor, a monthly magazine for pension fund and asset managers. After starting the publication in 1967, at 26, he built it into a multimedia concern comprising magazines, journals, conferences and other services. He sold the company in 1984 for a figure reported to exceed $70 million. By then, Mr. Kaplan had embarked on his unlikely vocation as a globe-trotting conductor of Mahler's Second Symphony -- and only Mahler's Second Symphony. That work, which had held him in thrall for years, would propel him onto the podiums of some of the world's leading orchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic, the London Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the St. Louis Symphony and, in an outing that became the subject of a headline-making fracas, the New York Philharmonic. For an untrained conductor to lead a symphony orchestra -- much less to lead one in a fiendish piece like Mahler's Second -- is, as The St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote in a 1991 review of one of Mr. Kaplan's concerts, ''almost preposterous.'' But in that ''almost'' hung a tale of obsession, determination and midlife renewal that became, as The New York Times described it in 2003, ''one of the strangest acts of wish fulfillment in musical history.'' Mahler's Second, known as the ''Resurrection'' Symphony, is a work of titanic power. The piece, which had its world premiere in Berlin in 1895, entails an orchestra of more than 100, a vast choir, choral soloists, multiple harps, a pipe organ and additional offstage percussion and brass. Its five movements span some 90 minutes and have been said to evoke the most elemental aspects of human experience -- joy and sorrow, birth and death -- and, ultimately, resurrection. By 1982, when Mr. Kaplan made his sweaty-palmed debut with the American Symphony Orchestra, he had undergone an immersion worthy of George Plimpton, devouring recordings, traveling the world to hear every live performance, grilling scholars and conductors and undergoing a monthlong nine-hour-a-day boot camp in the mechanics of conducting. Mr. Kaplan would go on to conduct the ''Resurrection'' more than 100 times. He would become a recognized authority on the piece and the owner of its original score, which he published in facsimile; a lecturer on Mahler; and the owner of a bust of him by Rodin. As a conductor, Mr. Kaplan divided reviewers. Some called his performances lackluster and superficial, if well intentioned. But in the end, as unlikely as it seemed, he also wound up with a sheaf of rapturous notices and -- more unlikely still -- a top-selling, critically esteemed recording of the symphony that had possessed him since he was a young man. The son of a shirt manufacturer, Gilbert Edmund Kaplan was born in Manhattan on March 3, 1941, and reared in Lawrence, on Long Island. His family, he said, was for the most part unmusical: As a boy, Gilbert endured three years of piano lessons and played the guitar a little. (His older brother, under the professional name Joseph Brooks, became a songwriter whose hits included ''You Light Up My Life.'') After attending Duke University, he earned a bachelor's degree from the New School for Social Research in New York and studied at New York University Law School. In 1963, he took a $15,000-a-year job as an economist with the American Stock Exchange. He soon became conscious of the importance of money managers in financial markets -- and of a gap in the marketplace when it came to meeting their needs. ''They were professional investors,'' Mr. Kaplan told The Sunday Times of London in 1984. ''Here was a group of people who had no information about their field -- and an audience that advertisers wanted to reach in a major way.'' Scraping together $150,000 -- two-thirds of it borrowed from Gerald Bronfman, whose family owned the Seagram distilling company -- he put out the first issue of The Institutional Investor, as it was originally known, in March 1967. Mr. Kaplan, who also held the title of editor in chief, appointed the financial journalist George J.-W. Goodman, better known by the pseudonym Adam Smith, as the magazine's inaugural editor. After selling the company in 1984 to Capital Cities Communications, he stayed on until 1992 as Institutional Investor's editor in chief. The ''Resurrection'' had put its hold on Mr. Kaplan in 1965, when he attended a performance of the piece by the American Symphony, under Leopold Stokowski, at Carnegie Hall. ''I wanted to get inside the music,'' he told The Age, a Melbourne, Australia, newspaper, in 1993. ''There's a real explanation of life and death in that music, and I wanted to get to the bottom of it.'' But to get fully inside the music, he came to realize, he would have to learn to conduct it. That he had long since forgotten his scant musical instruction was no impediment. ''Someone once told me that a bumblebee, judged by aerodynamic principles, is incapable of flying,'' Mr. Kaplan told The Associated Press in 1988. ''But the bumblebee doesn't know that. So I kept going forward.'' In 1981, he enlisted the services of Charles Zachary Bornstein, a young conductor fresh out of the Juilliard School, who oversaw his monthlong immersion. He snagged a two-hour lesson in London with Georg Solti. He studied German. He lifted weights. ''Your arms get tired from two minutes of changing a light bulb,'' Mr. Kaplan told The Times of London. ''Try keeping them up for an hour and a half.'' He seeded his copy of the score with a thicket of notations. ''Start left,'' the first one read, a reminder to aim his baton toward the violins at the outset. He rented Avery Fisher Hall and engaged the American Symphony and the Westminster Symphonic Choir. The orchestra, collectively astonished, agreed on two conditions: that no tickets be sold and no reviews be published. On Sept. 9, 1982, Mr. Kaplan mounted the podium for what he intended simultaneously to be his debut and his farewell performance, an invitation-only gala for 2,700 guests, staged at an estimated cost of $100,000. He had solved the problem of his music literacy by conducting the entire score from memory. Should his memory fail, he said, he planned to turn to the audience and announce, ''Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served.'' But he did not need to, finishing the performance to a thunderous ovation. At least one critic in the house, Leighton Kerner of The Village Voice, broke the embargo to publish a glowing review, declaring the performance to be ''one of the five or six most profoundly realized Mahler Seconds I had heard in a quarter-century.'' Offers poured in, and Mr. Kaplan went on to lead the piece with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic of London, the Russian National Orchestra, the Philharmonic Orchestra of La Scala and dozens of other ensembles. There was some jeering. ''The Resurrectionist,'' the headlines called him, ''One-Hit Wonder'' and, inevitably, ''Walter Mitty.'' More seriously, some reviewers taxed Mr. Kaplan with being a checkbook maestro, paying orchestras to let him ascend the podium. He denied doing so, although he acknowledged that his refusal to accept a fee constituted a de facto savings for the ensembles he led. Perhaps the worst moment in Mr. Kaplan's new career came in December 2008, when he led the ''Resurrection'' with the New York Philharmonic. On the day of the concert, the musicians held an hourlong meeting with the orchestra's president, Zarin Mehta, to vent their frustration with Mr. Kaplan's musicianship. Mr. Kaplan was not invited to lead the Philharmonic again, but there were laurels elsewhere. He recorded the ''Resurrection'' with full orchestra twice, first with the London Symphony and later with the Vienna Philharmonic. The London Symphony recording, featuring the London Symphony Chorus and the vocal soloists Benita Valente and Maureen Forrester, was named by The New York Times as one of the best classical records of 1988. By 2008, it had sold more than 180,000 copies, making it, The Times reported, the biggest-selling Mahler recording of any kind. Mr. Kaplan's other work includes ''The Mahler Album,'' a lavishly illustrated book he published in 1995. He was also a noted collector of Surrealist art. Mr. Kaplan's brother, Mr. Brooks, committed suicide in 2011, two years after he had been charged with drugging and sexually assaulting more than a dozen women. Besides his daughter Emily, Gilbert Kaplan's survivors include his wife, the former Lena Birck, whom he married in 1970 and who wears the only ring that Mahler was known to have given his wife, Alma; two other daughters, Kristina Wallison and Claude Davies; a son, John; and eight grandchildren. Mr. Kaplan served over the years on the boards of the American Symphony and Carnegie Hall, and taught in the evening division of the Juilliard School. If, in his unplanned second act, Mr. Kaplan was tilting at windmills, at least he was doing so with one of Mahler's batons, which he also owned. And though some critics continued to snipe, his work, admirers said, unmistakably reflected his passion, his fealty to Mahler's intentions and, quite possibly, the idea that a man's grasp might sometimes equal his reach. He was, in any case, far from the only conductor to incur critical barbs with the ''Resurrection.'' Reviewing the United States premiere of the piece, The New York Times praised the performance generally, but described some aspects as ''lacking in unity and proportion'' and ''fragmentary and bizarre.'' That concert took place in December 1908 and featured the New York Symphony Orchestra, a progenitor of the Philharmonic. On the podium was Gustav Mahler."

He was 89 years old and lived in Santa Barbara. Mr. Geiringer was born in Vienna, where he studied composition and musicology. He took his doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1922 with a dissertation on musical instruments in Renaissance painting that was republished as a book in 1979. In the late 1920's he began the editorial work that continued throughout his life, and in 1930 he became curator of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna. In this position he set about bringing into order vast amounts of primary source material relating to the greatest masters of German music. He drew on the material for a series of books that have remained essential reading for musicians and scholars. ''Brahms: His Life and Works,'' published by Houghton Mifflin in 1936 and expanded at various later dates, drew on more than 1,000 letters to the composer, extensive sketches and even a few minor compositions not known to the musical world before Mr. Geiringer unearthed them. He also brought to light some 35 unpublished songs of Hugo Wolf that had fallen into a legal limbo as a result of contractual problems. Major Projects It was Mr. Geiringer's habit to take on the largest topics; his other major books are ''Haydn: A Creative Life in Music,'' published in 1946 by W. W. Norton; ''The Bach Family: Seven Generations of Creative Genius'' (Oxford University Press, 1954), and ''Johann Sebastian Bach: The Culmination of an Era,'' written with Irene Geiringer and published in 1966 by Oxford. In 1938, Mr. Geiringer went to London, where he taught at the Royal Conservatory of Music and broadcast for the BBC, and a year later he joined the great wave of refugees from Hitler that changed the face of American higher education (musicology not least). He taught first at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., then spent 21 years at Boston University. He moved in 1962 to Santa Barbara to teach at the University of California there. Over the years he also published numerous musicological articles and edited works by composers major and minor. In 1973 he became Professor Emeritus but continued to teach each year; this spring he was to have offered a course in Bach's cantatas. He was also at work on articles about C. P. E. Bach and Beethoven at the time of his death. Mr. Geiringer was twice president of the American Musicological Society and was elected in 1959 to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is survived by his second wife, the pianist Bernice Geiringer; two sons, Martin and George, and four grandchildren."

She was 83.","Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist who identified a stealthy virus that invades bacteria and hides within its DNA, often emerging later to do its destructive work, died Nov. 11 in Stanford, Calif. She was 83. The cause was complications of congestive heart failure and pneumonia, her family said. Dr. Lederberg was also a central member of a team led by her husband, Joshua Lederberg, who shared a Nobel Prize for genetic research in 1958. In the early 1950s, while conducting experiments with E. coli bacteria, Esther Lederberg discovered a previously unreported virus that was infecting the bacteria but doing no immediate harm to the host organism. She found that the virus, which she named the lambda phage, was being transmitted through bacterial matings and ordinary genetic material. It would then remain dormant or, under certain circumstances, awaken to destroy the host. Her findings helped explain how phages pass between generations of bacteria. Her research also served as a model to help unlock the mechanism of genetic inheritance in more complex viruses. Working with her husband and others, Dr. Lederberg subsequently developed a successful method of rapidly transferring colonies of bacteria from one glass plate to another. Their method called for a velvet cloth to be placed over the colonies and then pressed onto a second plate treated with an antibiotic or a virus. The technique, called replica plating, is still in use and enables researchers to isolate bacteria that are resistant to compounds on the plates. For work in bacterial genetics, Joshua Lederberg shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958 with two other researchers, George W. Beadle and Edward L. Tatum. The next year, he and his wife moved to Stanford University, where she took an untenured research position. They divorced in 1966. From 1978 to 1990, Joshua Lederberg was president of the Rockefeller University, the biomedical research institution in New York. Yesterday, President Bush announced that he was a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. In the 1970s and 80s, Esther Lederberg assumed a curatorial role at Stanford and directed its Plasmid Reference Center, a collection of DNA molecules derived mainly from bacteria.

22780,"Art Gilmore, the Voice of Coming Attractions, Dies at 98","Art Gilmore, whose disembodied voice, introducing television shows and narrating hundreds (if not thousands) of movie trailers, was a trademark of Hollywood's self-salesmanship from the 1940s through the 1960s, died Sept. 25 in Irvine, Calif.","Art Gilmore, whose disembodied voice, introducing television shows and narrating hundreds (if not thousands) of movie trailers, was a trademark of Hollywood's self-salesmanship from the 1940s through the 1960s, died Sept. 25 in Irvine, Calif. He was 98. He died of age-related causes, said his wife, Grace. Mr. Gilmore actually did some acting on television, playing full-bodied parts in shows like ''Dragnet,'' ''Emergency!'' and ''Adam 12.'' But for most moviegoers and television watchers of a certain age, Mr. Gilmore was a star without a name or a face; he was even cast as a never-seen radio announcer in several episodes of ''The Waltons.'' His voice -- crisp and articulate, just a tad piercing, cagily pitched to the subject matter and inflected with a precisely calibrated measure of enthusiasm -- was as recognizable as a theme song. Among many other television appearances, Mr. Gilmore was the announcer on ''The Red Skelton Show'' -- ''Live! From Television City in Hollywood!'' -- from 1954 to 1971. He was an announcer of the mid-1950s dramatic anthology series ''Climax''; he narrated all 39 episodes of the late 1950s western series ''Mackenzie's Raiders.'' And from 1955 to 1959, he narrated the crime series ''Highway Patrol,'' which starred Broderick Crawford. ''Whenever the laws of any state are broken, each state has a duly authorized organization that swings into action; it may be called the state militia or the state police or the highway patrol,'' Mr. Gilmore intoned at the start of each weekly episode, sounding much the same notes that the voice-over specialist Steve Zirnkilton would hit decades later, introducing the shows of the ''Law & Order'' franchise. ''These are the stories of the men whose training, skill and courage have enforced and preserved our state laws.'' As the narrator of countless movie trailers (his wife estimated he did 3,000), Mr. Gilmore was an especially effective pitchman, delivering the language of hype with masterful conviction. Comedies, thrillers, romances, musicals, animation, documentaries -- it didn't matter. Among the films Mr. Gilmore promoted as coming attractions were ''Dumbo,'' ''A Place in the Sun,'' ''Roman Holiday,'' ''Shane,''''Born Yesterday,'' ''Rear Window,'' ''South Pacific,'' ''War and Peace,'' ''Ocean's 11,'' ''White Christmas'' and ''Bye Bye Birdie.'' ''The screen jumps for joy with Glendon Swarthout's inside story of those uproarious Easter vacations,'' Mr. Gilmore pronounced in the trailer for ''Where the Boys Are,'' a 1960 comedy about college girls on the make. ''Never before has any film contained such a full measure of the joy of living,'' he asserted in the trailer for Frank Capra's life-affirming small-town tale from 1946, ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' For the 1953 science-fiction thriller ''The War of the Worlds'' he declared: ''This could be the beginning of the end for the human race!'' And in a virtuosic bit of melodramatic recitation, he described Alfred Hitchcock's loopy and masterful psychodrama ''Vertigo'' (1958) as ''the story of a love so powerful it broke through all the barriers between past and present, between life and death, between the golden girl in the dark tower and the tawdry redhead that he tried to remake in her image.'' Arthur Wells Gilmore was born in Tacoma, Wash., on March 18, 1912. His father was a bookkeeper and an insurance man who had moved west from Massachusetts with his wife shortly before his son was born. Young Arthur attended Washington State University where he worked at the campus radio station. Later, he worked at a commercial station in Seattle before moving to Los Angeles in the 1930s and becoming a staff announcer for KFWB in Hollywood. Later he moved to KNX, which was owned by CBS. Before the era of television, he announced radio shows like ''Amos 'n' Andy,'' ''The Sears Radio Theater'' and ''Red Ryder.'' He served in the Navy during World War II. For a time in the 1960s he was president of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the labor union. In 1964, on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, he introduced a political advertisement consisting of an address by Ronald Reagan, a speech called ''A Time for Choosing,'' that is often cited as a factor in establishing Reagan's influence in conservative politics. In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Marilyn Gilmore, of Irvine, and Barbara McCoy, of Rockford, Ill., two grandchildren and four great grandchildren. Mr. and Mrs. Gilmore, 97, met in high school and were married 72 years. ''They dated for eight years before that,'' their daughter Marilyn said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

He was 90. Dr. Connery taught at various universities for over four decades. He was the author, co-author or editor of more than a score of books, including a classic study, ""Rockefeller of New York: Executive Power in the Statehouse,"" written with Gerald Benjamin. ""I came across 'Rockefeller of New York' shortly after it was published in 1979,"" Gov.-elect Mario M. Cuomo said in December 1982. ""It told me more about the workings of state government than all the other pertinent books, monographs, articles and white papers I had read combined."" Dr. Connery served Mayor Robert F. Wagner as Deputy City Administrator in 1965. He previously acted as senior consultant to the State Commission on Governmental Operations of the City of New York and executive secretary of the city's Committee on Modern Zoning. After his retirement from Columbia in 1976, city administrators continued to consult with him for some time. He was president of the Academy of Political Science from 1966 to 1986 and edited some 40 volumes of its proceedings. His scholarly writings ranged widely over Federal, state and local issues. Even his 1935 doctoral dissertation, ""Governmental Problems in Wildlife Conservation,"" stirred considerable interest. It led to his debut as a government consultant in a dispute between New York and New Jersey over shad fisheries in the Hudson River. It was followed by a similar undertaking involving fisheries of the Great Lakes. That eventually helped shape a treaty between Canada and the United States. He was born in St. Paul and graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1929. He received his master's degree there in 1930 and his doctorate in 1935 from Columbia, where he was an instructor at the time. During World War II, he served as a naval officer and historian on the staff of James V. Forrestal, the Secretary of the Navy, attaining the rank of commander. The experience prompted him to write, with Richard Leach, ""The Navy and the Industrial Mobilization in World War II"" (1951), and, with Robert G. Albion, ""Forrestal and the Navy"" (1962), which covered Forrestal's years in the Navy Department and the rapid expansion of the American armada he oversaw. After the war Dr. Connery taught at the Catholic University of America, Stanford, the University of Illinois and Duke before he returned to Columbia in 1966 as a professor of government. He served as a senior staff member for the Brookings Institution in the early 1950's, conducting surveys of foreign affairs, NATO and the United Nations. The many books, chapters and articles he wrote or edited covered urban riots, municipal taxes, economic affairs, the unionization of city workers and sundry other subjects. A reprint of his 1935 dissertation is in print even today, as is ""The Politics of Mental Health"" (1968) and ""The Federal Government and Metropolitan Areas"" (1978). Dr. Connery, who never married, leaves no immediate survivors."

He was 85. Blassie died in Hartsdale, N.Y., Jeff Walton, a former wrestling publicist, told The Los Angeles Times. Born Fred Blassman in St. Louis, Blassie played baseball and football in high school. He joined the Navy at the start of World War II and started wrestling under the name of Sailor Fred Blassie while stationed at Port Hueneme in California. After the war, he continued to wrestle professionally in the Midwest. He liked to use a variety of names but had trouble gaining the affection of fans who gravitated toward the likes of Lou Thesz and Gorgeous George. It was not until he moved to the West Coast that fans began supporting him. Blassie began portraying himself as a villain, and it worked. He claimed to file his teeth to draw blood from opponents, and among his nicknames was the Vampire. The nastier he was in the ring, the more popular he became to fans. Blassie also mastered the television interview, boasting his superiority over other wrestlers he liked to call ""pencil-neck geeks."" Those colorful interviews helped make him a celebrity in the newly expanding medium of television. He won the World Wrestling Association world heavyweight championship from the Frenchman Edouard Carpentier at the Los Angeles Sports Arena in 1961. Blassie also was seen with the comedian Andy Kaufman in ""My Breakfast With Blassie,"" a 1983 spoof of ""My Dinner With Andre."" He retired from competition in the late 1970's to manage a new generation of wrestlers, including Hulk Hogan and Jesse Ventura, the future governor of Minnesota. Blassie worked for the World Wrestling Federation, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, which presented him with its lifetime achievement award in 1996. He did an advice segment on the ""Tuesday Night Titans"" TV program, made personal appearances and did radio interviews. Blassie is survived by his wife, Miyako, and three children."

48242,"FREDRICK EATON, A LAWYER, IS DEAD","Fredrick McCurdy Eaton, a Wall Street lawyer who took on various Government assignments, died Wednesday at his home in Dublin, N.H..","Fredrick McCurdy Eaton, a Wall Street lawyer who took on various Government assignments, died Wednesday at his home in Dublin, N.H.. He was 79 years old. Mr. Eaton, who was the senior partner of Shearman & Sterling in Manhattan from 1964 until he retired in 1975, was the chief United States negotiator at the disarmament talks in Geneva in 1960. He also served as counsel to the War Production Board in World War II, as special counsel to the Secretary of the Army during the espionage hearings conducted by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and as head of an investigation of the intelligence community during the Johnson Administration. A Sensitive Assignment Perhaps Mr. Eaton's most sensitive assignment came when President Eisenhower asked him to head the American delegation to the 10-nation East-West disarmament conference. When a friend noted the oddity of a Wall Street lawyer negotiating with the Communists, Mr. Eaton, with a humor that he often used to relieve tense situations, replied that he hoped the Russians would choose as his counterpart ''a good Gorki Street lawyer.'' But humor was not to be a dominant tone of the conference, which lasted only a few weeks. The conference was marked by sharp exchanges of charges and countercharges. A Direct Response The Soviet Union's downing of an American U-2 reconnaissance plane piloted by Gary Powers further cast a pall over the sessions. On June 27, 1960, as the West prepared to unveil a new plan, the Russians accused the United States of being more interested in espionage than in disarmament and stalked out of the conference room. Mr. Eaton, a tall, ruddy man, responded with characteristic directness, accusing the Soviet Union of ''torpedoing'' the conference. ''This Soviet action today, this refusal to continue the discussions is convincing proof that the present Soviet motivation is propaganda, pure propaganda,'' he told the four Western delegates sitting across the table. Mr. Eaton, who was born in Akron, Ohio, graduated from Harvard University and the Harvard Law School. Started as Law Clerk His first job was as a law clerk with the Wall Street firm of Cotton & Franklin, and, after his wartime service, he joined Shearman & Sterling. He was a longtime resident of Manhattan, but retired to New Hampshire, where as a younger man he had fished for trout and hunted grouse and partridge. He was a director of Citibank, the Monsanto Company, the Consolidated Edison Company, the New York Life Insurance Company, the Great American Insurance Companies and the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation. He served as an officer and trustee of the American Museum of Natural History and of the Presbyterian Hospital and was chairman of the Harvard College Fund.

43593,"Edgar Froese, Leader of Tangerine Dream, Dies at 70","Edgar Froese, the leader of the long-running and prolific German group Tangerine Dream -- first an improvising avant-garde rock band, then an ambient electronic-music project, and finally an arena-filling machine of smooth and heroic synthesizer pulsations -- died on Jan. 20 in Vienna.","Edgar Froese, the leader of the long-running and prolific German group Tangerine Dream -- first an improvising avant-garde rock band, then an ambient electronic-music project, and finally an arena-filling machine of smooth and heroic synthesizer pulsations -- died on Jan. 20 in Vienna. He was 70. His death was announced on the Facebook page of his son, Jerome. He had a pulmonary embolism, according to a posting on the Tangerine Dream website. Over many periods and many different lineups, with Mr. Froese as the only constant, Tangerine Dream released more than 100 albums. In the mid-1970s, when the band was signed to the Virgin label, it could amass unit sales in six figures for an instrumental album, with little radio play. During this period, Mr. Froese, along with his bandmates Christopher Franke and Peter Baumann, created a meditative aural space of slowly unfolding patterns. Two of the group's most successful records, ''Phaedra'' (1974) and ''Rubycon'' (1975), were albums of serene sonic research, their individual tracks lasting up to 20 minutes with no singing or drumming and minimal melodic or harmonic material. Edgar Froese (FRO-zee) was born on D-Day, June 6, 1944, in Tilsit, which was then in East Prussia and is now the town of Sovetsk, Russia. He took piano lessons at 12 before turning to guitar. He studied painting and sculpture at what was the Academy of Art in West Berlin at the time, and for a few years played guitar in a rock band called the Ones. While visiting Spain in 1966, he met Salvador Dal, whose insistence on following a path of originality inspired Mr. Froese's thinking from then on. The first version of Tangerine Dream was a free-improvising group influenced by Pink Floyd, with Mr. Froese on guitar. After two albums in that vein, the group got rid of drums; briefly incorporated the musician Florian Fricke, later of the band Popol Vuh, who owned a modular Moog synthesizer (rare in Germany in 1972); and shifted to contemplative sounds for the albums ''Zeit'' (1972) and ''Atem'' (1973). In the mid-'70s, Tangerine Dream became known for performing in cathedrals. After a greatly oversold 1974 concert at the cathedral in Reims, France, Mr. Froese told interviewers, Pope Paul VI banished the group from any further performances in Roman Catholic churches. The next year they played in Protestant cathedrals instead. Mr. Froese went on to score dozens of films from 1977 through the 1980s, including the Hollywood features ''Sorcerer,'' ''Thief'' and ''Risky Business.'' The band's music changed as the technology changed, becoming less sonically immersive and more beat-driven as the musicians began using digital synthesizers. With the addition of Jerome Froese from 1990 to 2006, the band moved in the direction of dance music. Besides his son, Mr. Froese's survivors include his wife, Bianca Acquaye. After Mr. Froese set up his own label in the mid-'90s, the group increased its output enormously, releasing as many as four albums a year. By its final tours, the band was incorporating introspective spaciness, Latin rhythms, smooth-jazz soprano saxophone solos, brisk synth-pop and versions of songs by Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles alongside the old pulsating Tangerine Dream instrumentals. The group's first wave of popularity alarmed some rock critics, who feared a takeover by a Eurocentric, rhythmless pop that relied on machines and encouraged passivity. Lester Bangs, reviewing a 1977 concert at Avery Fisher Hall for The Village Voice in 1977, described it as ''three technological monoliths emitting urps and hissings and pings and swooshings in the dark,'' and said he left early. But the group's influence has endured. It can be heard in Detroit techno, English electronica and the work of current electronic bands like Glass Candy and the Chromatics. In 2013, Mr. Froese wrote music for the video game ''Grand Theft Auto V,'' contributing over 60 hours of material. Though he was usually viewed in the context of German art rock and electronic music, Mr. Froese felt allegiance to neither. ''If there is a true possibility of creating modern synthesized music without any mental barriers,'' he said in a 2010 interview, ''I would consider myself as one of the strongest followers of such a movement.''"

Mr. Dugmore was born and reared in Hartford, and received his bachelor's degree at the Hartford Art School. In 1940 he studied with Thomas Hart Benton at what was then the Kansas City Art Institute. After serving in the Marine Corps in World War II, he studied at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, where he was influenced by Abstract Expressionist artists: Clyfford Still, who was teaching there, and Ernest Briggs, a fellow student, both of whom remained friends thereafter. He continued his studies in Mexico and received his master's degree in fine arts at the University of Guadalajara. In 1952 Mr. Dugmore moved to New York, where his paintings were exhibited at the Stable Gallery. In the 1960's his works were shown at the Howard Wise Gallery, and in the 1970's at the Green Mountain Gallery. Three of his 1950's abstract paintings -- ""Untitled"" from 1954, ""Number 30"" from 1952 and ""Tlaquepaque 12"" from 1952 -- are included in ""San Francisco School of Abstract Expressionism,"" an exhibition opening on July 18 at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

He was 86 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The cause was pneumonia, his family said. At his death, Mr. Dickler was chairman of the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, which he helped to establish in 1985 under the will of Lee Krasner, the Abstract Expressionist painter and widow of Jackson Pollock. Mr. Dickler was the lawyer for Lee Krasner's estate. The foundation gives individual grants to ""talented visual artists in need of funds"" in the United States and abroad. Its most recent report said it had assets of almost $50 million. Besides his volunteer work, Mr. Dickler was a successful lawyer with lucrative links to the broadcast industry. He was a founder and corporate secretary of Capital Cities Broadcasting in the mid-1950's. In 1959, he joined what is now the firm of Hall, Dickler, Kent, Friedman & Wood, from which he retired as a senior, founding partner in 1989. He was born in Manhattan to immigrants from Russia and Romania and graduated from George Washington High School in 1928. After completing Columbia College in 1931, he got his law degree from Columbia Law School at 20 in 1933 and went to work for the law firm of Sam Rosenman, a member of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal brain trust, his policy-making advisers. Two years later, he went into practice on his own. One day he received a call from Rolf Kaltenborn, son of the news broadcaster and commentator H. V. Kaltenborn, requesting his legal help -- without pay -- to organize the first radio workers' union, a forerunner of Aftra, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Mr. Dickler's work for the union shaped his career. H. V. Kaltenborn, impressed by the work of the 23-year-old lawyer, recommended him to others in the business, and Mr. Dickler went to work with the writer and broadcaster Lowell Thomas and Mike Todd, the movie director, in promoting Cinerama, the wide-screen movie format. After Cinerama was sold in the mid-1950's, Mr. Dickler and others joined to buy a small radio station in Albany and a television outlet in Durham, N.C. They formed the cornerstones of Capital Cities Communications, which grew into a major media force with stakes in radio, television and publishing. In 1986, the company took over ABC and became Capital Cities/ABC Inc., of which Mr. Dickler was a board member emeritus; it, in turn, was swallowed up in 1996 by the Walt Disney Company. Mr. Dickler was the author of ""Man on Trial: History-Making Trials from Socrates to Oppenheimer"" (Doubleday, 1962). It summed up 13 trials and excerpted court records from cases that he selected for having reflected their times and leaving an impact on Western history. Mr. Dickler represented John Henry Faulk, whose career in radio and television was cut short when CBS fired him 1955. The dismissal followed allegations of Communist sympathies on Mr. Faulk's part. Mr. Dickler, his former business manager, worked for him without pay in the ensuing litigation. He also had his brush with the bitter and labyrinthine feud over the valuable estate of Mark Rothko that went on for years among the painter's heirs, executors and other parties. Rothko committed suicide, and Mr. Dicker represented the guardian and aunt of Rothko's young son, Christopher, in the court battles. Mr. Dickler is survived by his wife of 65 years, Ruth Crohn Dickler; three daughters, Abby Pratt of West Stockbridge, Mass., Jane Lebow of Manhattan and Susan Dickler of Lexington, Mass.; a brother, Irving, of Sunrise, Fla., and four grandchildren. http://www.nytimes.com"
37907,"Donald Harvey, 64, the 'Angel of Death' Who Killed Dozens of Patients, Dies","Donald Harvey, a health care worker called the Angel of Death by the news media after he killed dozens of hospital patients under his care in the 1970s and '80s, died on Thursday after he was attacked in his prison cell in Ohio.","Donald Harvey, a health care worker called the Angel of Death by the news media after he killed dozens of hospital patients under his care in the 1970s and '80s, died on Thursday after he was attacked in his prison cell in Ohio. He was 64. Lt. Robert G. Sellers, a spokesman for the Ohio State Highway Patrol, who confirmed the death, said Mr. Harvey had been assaulted at the Toledo Correctional Institution on Tuesday afternoon by another inmate. He said an investigation was continuing. Mr. Harvey, among the most prolific mass murderers in United States history, confessed to killing 37 people, mostly hospital patients, over two decades in Ohio and Kentucky. The ghoulishness of his killings -- which he described as an act of benevolence and mercy that he provided to the sick and old people -- drew international attention. He was serving consecutive life sentences at his death. ''He's no mercy killer,'' Arthur M. Ney Jr., the Ohio prosecutor who handled his case, told the court in 1987. ''He killed because he liked to kill.'' Donald Harvey was born in Hamilton, Ohio, outside Cincinnati, on April 15, 1952. A short time later, his family relocated to Booneville, Ky., a tiny town in Appalachia, where he grew up in a poor family and, according to a psychiatrist who examined him after his arrest, was sexually abused by relatives. He dropped out of school in ninth grade. After his arrest in 1987, his mother, Goldie McKinley, said: ''He's still a good boy. He's just terribly sick and he needs a good doctor.'' Mr. Harvey killed most of his victims by poisoning them with substances like cyanide, rat poison, petroleum distillate or arsenic, which he often mixed into beverages or foods like freshly baked pie. Others were suffocated in their hospital beds, either with their pillows or by oxygen tanks that he refused to refill. Mr. Harvey first acquired morbid nicknames like the Kiss of Death from co-workers, who joked about the number of patients who died while he was on duty. Mr. Harvey joined in the joking, and because his victims were old or in poor health, their deaths did not arouse much suspicion. ''He'd say, 'I got another one today,''' the prosecutor told the court. ''And everybody thought it was just a joke.'' Mr. Harvey told CBS News in 2003 that he had been able to kill so many people so discreetly in busy hospital wards because ''most of the doctors would be so overworked.'' ''So busy, that a patient could die and the family doctor would not come in and pronounce the person dead,'' he added. ''They'd have a resident do that. They just pronounce him dead and send him straight to his funeral home.'' The authorities first learned of his killing spree almost by accident when a doctor performing an autopsy on a recently deceased patient, John Powell, detected the telltale scent of cyanide in his stomach cavity. He had been hospitalized after a motorcycle accident. During his confession, Mr. Harvey said Mr. Powell had been one of two patients he had killed that day. In 1987, Mr. Harvey pleaded guilty to killing 21 patients at Daniel Drake Memorial Hospital, now Daniel Drake Center for Post-Acute Care, in Cincinnati in the 1980s. He also pleaded guilty to killing 13 patients at Marymount Hospital in London, Ky., in 1970 and '71. Three of his Ohio victims were not hospital patients: One was a neighbor to whom he gave an arsenic-laced pie; another was his roommate's father; and the third was an acquaintance. He claimed to have killed many more people -- his lawyer told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2003 that Mr. Harvey ''estimated'' that he had killed roughly 70 people -- but many of those claims never led to charges. Mr. Harvey showed no remorse for his actions during his 1987 trial in Ohio. He chuckled when the prosecutor displayed the names of his victims in court on a 4-foot-by-8-foot board, and he seemed to dislike hospitals. During his trial and throughout the years of his incarcerations, he held firm in his belief that he had done his victims a favor. ''I felt what I was doing was right,'' he told reporters in 1987. ''I was putting people out of their misery. I hope if I'm ever sick and full of tubes or on a respirator, someone will come and end it.''"
20145,"E. J. Safra, 67, Banker and Philanthropist","Edmond J. Safra, the banker and philanthropist who died in an apparent arson at his Monaco penthouse today, built a vast banking group with Wall Street hustle and old world conservatism.","PARIS, Dec. 3 Edmond J. Safra, the banker and philanthropist who died in an apparent arson at his Monaco penthouse today, built a vast banking group with Wall Street hustle and old world conservatism. His death came only a few weeks after he reached a turning point in his tumultuous career, when he agreed after months of negotiations to sell his banking businesses, including Republic National Bank of New York, to HSBC Holdings, the biggest British banking company, for $9.9 billion. Under the agreement, Mr. Safra, 67, who suffered from Parkinson's disease and planned to retire, was to get a payout of $2.3 billion. The deal to sell Mr. Safra's Republic New York Corporation and Safra Republic Holdings marked the end of independence for a banking business founded more than three decades ago by Mr. Safra, an enduring figure in the banking world. Mr. Safra started Republic in 1966 in a townhouse just south of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. But he suffered recently from Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder, and there was growing speculation that he would sell. In the early years, Mr. Safra built his business largely on wealthy international banking clients, many of whom were Middle Eastern Jews who fled Arab countries after the creation of the state of Israel. With a warm and compelling wit, he made confidentiality and cautious dealing hallmarks of his business. His opponents, and they were many, accused him of dealing in dirty money, the proceeds of arms trading and drug trafficking. But in 1989 the American Express Company was forced to offer a public apology and donate $8 million to charities designated by Mr. Safra, in an admission that company executives had organized a campaign to malign him. To his admirers, and they were numerous in the United States and elsewhere, he was an excellent banker with a compelling intelligence who was dedicated to Jewish causes and poured the proceeds of his banking into numerous charities dear to him and his family. In a statement today, Sir John R. H. Bond, group chairman of HSBC, said the bank ""will uphold the banking tradition and integrity which were the hallmarks of Edmond's life."" In the past, Mr. Safra has been praised by influential figures, including Henry A. Kissinger and Elie Wiesel. He was in demand as a counselor and sat on the international advisory board of Harvard University. The son of a banker of Syrian origin, Edmond Jacob Safra was born in Beirut on Aug. 6, 1932. At the age of 16, he joined the family banking business, which stretched back a century and was involved in financing the Ottoman Empire's caravan trade. He was involved in the precious metals and foreign exchange activities that benefited from the post-World War II revival of international commerce. In 1952 his father, Jacob E. Safra, moved the family to Brazil, where three years later the family founded a bank in Sao Paulo that later became Banco Safra S.A., which is still managed by Mr. Safra's brothers, Moishe and Joseph. Moving to expand the family business abroad, Mr. Safra migrated in 1956 to Geneva. Much of his activity in the following years was based on the extraordinary growth of the Trade Development Bank, which he founded with roughly $1 million of his own money, to tap the Swiss private banking market. In 1983, when Trade Development had deposits of almost $5 billion, he sold it to American Express for $550 million. When American Express executives became convinced that Mr. Safra had violated a pledge not to start a competing bank business for three years, they hired detectives to track down rumors that he was involved in the Iran-contra scandal and that his banks were laundering drug money. None of the rumors proved true, but the allegations began surfacing in newspaper articles in various countries. In July 1989, American Express agreed as part of a legal settlement to issue a public apology to Mr. Safra and to donate $8 million to charities of his choice. By the late 1980's, Mr. Safra was again active in private banking, erecting a banking empire around the Republic New York Corporation and an affiliated company, Safra Republic Holdings, the parents of banks serving clients around the world. Republic came to dominate some of the more exotic fringes of banking. While its heritage was in the world of international private banking, sheltering the fortunes of multimillionaires, it was equally a leader in precious metals and securities trading. For Mr. Safra personal banking was a way of life. A banker who once visited his home in Monaco said it was ""like a doctor's waiting room,"" with clients lined up. Though described by friends and associates as witty and warm, Mr. Safra avoided publicity, agreeing for the first time to reverse his policy in 1988, when he sought to raise new equity for Safra Republic Holdings. ""I try to remain unknown as much as possible,"" he told one of four reporters he received individually, accompanied by a senior bank associate and a public relations consultant. Expanding on his austere philosophy of banking, Mr. Safra listed the ingredients of his success: ""security, seriousness, hard work, careful lending, controlling expenses."" ""You can take a chance in life, but not with a bank,"" he said. ""A bank is not a playground. Banking is conservatism. And it has been the same for a few thousand years."" Mr. Safra kept homes in Geneva, Monaco, New York and Paris. A passionate family man, Mr. Safra was a contributor to scholarly institutions and charitable causes. When it was decided to build a Holocaust museum in New York, which opened in 1997, Mr. Safra pledged $1 million. He financed chairs for Sephardic studies at Yeshiva University in New York and at Harvard, in Latin American studies at Harvard and in banking studies at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1998 Mr. Safra's banking empire was shaken by severe economic downturns in several parts of the world, including Russia, where Republic New York Corporation lost $190 million in trading losses in one quarter because of errant bets on Russian securities. It was also in 1998 that Republic made a report to the F.B.I. that began an investigation into the possibility of a vast Russian money laundering that came to focus on the Bank of New York. This March, Republic New York announced that it planned to eliminate hundreds of jobs, about 7 percent of the total, and reorganize to refocus on profitable businesses. About two months later, the sale to HSBC was announced. Mr. Safra is survived by his wife, Lily, and her two children from a previous marriage, Adriana and Eduardo, and by his brothers, Moise and Joseph, of Brazil, and sisters, Arlette Friedler of Belgium and Gaby Safra and Huguette Michaan of Brazil. http://www.nytimes.com"
49633,Martin Kaplan Dies at 89; Fought Disease and Arms,"Martin M. Kaplan, a virologist, international public health official and humanitarian who spent his early career researching the spread of viral diseases and his later career working to fight the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, died on Oct. 16 in Geneva.","Martin M. Kaplan, a virologist, international public health official and humanitarian who spent his early career researching the spread of viral diseases and his later career working to fight the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, died on Oct. 16 in Geneva. He was 89 and lived in Collonge-Bellerive, Switzerland. The cause was cancer, his son Jeffrey said. Trained as a veterinarian, Dr. Kaplan was an authority on the role of animals in the transmission of certain human diseases, among them rabies and influenza. For many years an official of the World Health Organization, he also helped develop a safer rabies vaccine. More recently, Dr. Kaplan was an officer of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, which works for disarmament. He was also, variously, a horse trader, globetrotting amateur cellist and willing human guinea pig. Martin Mark Kaplan was born in Philadelphia on June 23, 1915. After receiving an undergraduate degree from Temple University, he earned a doctor of veterinary medicine degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1940, and a master's in public health degree there two years later. From 1942 to 1944, he taught veterinary medicine at Middlesex University (now Brandeis University), in Waltham, Mass. In 1944, Dr. Kaplan married the former Lenna Bouchal. She survives him, as do a daughter, Alexa Intrator of Ferney-Voltaire, France; two sons, Peter and Jeffrey, both doctors in Baltimore; and four grandchildren. After World War II, Dr. Kaplan joined the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Much of Europe's livestock had been devastated by the war, and on V-E Day he set sail for Greece in the company of six prize bulls, donated to help restock the cattle population there. On his arrival, he set about procuring more stock, traveling to Cyprus and Lebanon to buy mules and Arabian stallions. In 1949, Dr. Kaplan joined WHO, where he was chief of veterinary public health and later chief of medical research, promotion and development. He continued doing research, and was part of a team at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia that in the 1960's and 70's developed new rabies vaccines for humans and animals. The human vaccine was considered safer, and required many fewer injections, than the one developed by Louis Pasteur in the late 1800's. (Pasteur's vaccine entailed at least 14 painful shots in the abdomen and had potentially fatal side effects.) Dr. Kaplan was more than willing to take his own medicine. As reported in ''Who Goes First?'' (1987), by Lawrence K. Altman, the medical correspondent of The New York Times, he traveled to Kenya in 1955 to teach a course on rabies prevention. There, Dr. Kaplan and a colleague, Hilary Koprowski, demonstrated how to make a vaccine for humans, using chick embryos to culture a seed virus Dr. Koprowski had developed. Ten days after injecting the embryos, Dr. Altman writes, ''they cracked the eggs, ground up the chick embryos in blenders and filtered the material that included the rabies virus.'' From this they made a primitive vaccine, which contained, among other ingredients, macerated beaks and feathers. The two men rolled up their sleeves and injected themselves, with little ill effect. In the late 1950's, Dr. Kaplan joined the Pugwash movement. Named for the Nova Scotia village that was the site of the first conference in 1957, Pugwash, along with its founder, Joseph Rotblat, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995. As the organization's secretary general from 1976 to 1988, Dr. Kaplan worked for nuclear, chemical and biological disarmament. As Dr. Altman's book recounts, Dr. Kaplan had one enduring reminder of his self-administered rabies shot: an inch-long scar on his forearm at the injection site. But the shot did nothing to impair his ability to play the cello, which he even carried on his Kenya trip."
5456,"Robert Herman, 66, Ex-Manager Of Greater Miami Opera Troupe","Robert Herman, the general manager of the Greater Miami Opera from 1973 to 1985 and an assistant to Sir Rudolf Bing at the Metropolitan Opera from 1953 to 1973, died on Monday at his home in Miami.","Robert Herman, the general manager of the Greater Miami Opera from 1973 to 1985 and an assistant to Sir Rudolf Bing at the Metropolitan Opera from 1953 to 1973, died on Monday at his home in Miami. He was 66 years old. He died of lung cancer, said Walter Naujoks, his friend and business partner. Mr. Herman was widely credited with transforming the Greater Miami Opera, which is 51 years old, from a small regional troupe into one of the 10 biggest opera companies in the United States. By aggressively seeking corporate support instead of relying on individual contributions as the company had been doing, he was able to expand the budget from the $650,000 it had when he joined the company to nearly $4 million when he retired. Newcomers and Stars He was also able to lure star singers to Miami, among them Luciano Pavarotti, Sherrill Milnes, Beverly Sills, Judith Blegen and James McCracken. But he also kept the house open to young American singers. His policy was to have two casts, one with international stars, the other with promising newcomers. Another innovation was to offer alternating versions of operas, in English and the original language. He also expanded the repertory considerably by arranging to exchange productions with other companies. All these policies proved to be extremely successful: beginning in Mr. Herman's second season, the company consistently sold more than 90 percent of its tickets. Charles Robert Herman was born on Feb. 24, 1925, in Glendale, Calif. His father was Floyd Caves (Babe) Herman, an outfielder for the Brooklyn Dodgers and later a West Coast scout for the Yankees; his mother the former Ann Merriken. Mr. Herman attended the University of Southern California, where he studied opera with the director Carl Ebert. In 1953, on Mr. Ebert's recommendation, the Metropolitan Opera hired Mr. Herman as an assistant stage director and assistant stage manager. He quickly rose in the Met administration. In 1956 he became the focus of a dispute between the American Guild of Musical Artists and the Met when the union sought to discipline him, as a union member, for serving on the management's side during labor negotiations. The Met management threatened to cancel its season if Mr. Herman was disciplined, and the union eventually agreed not to take action. In 1957, when the conductor Max Rudolf left his post as the artistic administrator of the Met to become the music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, his job was split between Mr. Herman, who saw to the administrative side of the job, and Erich Leinsdorf, who took over Mr. Rudolf's conducting. As artistic administrator and assistant manager, Mr. Herman was in charge of juggling casts and budgets. He left his position when Sir Rudolf retired as the Met's general manager in 1972, and took up the directorship of the Greater Miami Opera the next year. In 1979, he proposed holding an international festival of music, dance, theater and the visual arts in Miami, and raised $4.2 million for his project, the New World Festival. With Mr. Herman as executive director, the 24-day festival in June 1982 presented 200 performances, including world premieres of 22 works. After his retirement as general manager of the Greater Miami Opera in 1985, he stayed on as the company's vice president for advocacy and development. He was named general manager emeritus in 1990. Besides his operatic activities, he was president of Opera America and a member of the Florida Arts Council. He is survived by his mother, Ann Merriken Herman of Glendale; a brother, Donald, of La Crescenta, Calif., and a sister, Dorothy McWhirter of Bell Canyon, Calif."

38317,William A. Bootle Dies at 102; Judge in Desegregation Case,"William Augustus Bootle, who as a federal judge in 1961 set in motion a chain of legal decisions that in a single week desegregated the University of Georgia, died on Tuesday at his home in Macon, Ga.","William Augustus Bootle, who as a federal judge in 1961 set in motion a chain of legal decisions that in a single week desegregated the University of Georgia, died on Tuesday at his home in Macon, Ga. He was 102. Judge Bootle's family announced the death. Judge Bootle, appointed to the Federal District Court in Georgia by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1954, presided over other civil rights cases in the state. ''I think Bootle will always go down in the annals of Southern and civil rights history as one of a handful of progressive-minded, courageous judges who were willing to make pivotal decisions at very key times in the 1960's,'' said Robert A. Pratt, a professor of history at the University of Georgia and the author of ''We Shall Not Be Moved'' (University of Georgia, 2002), an account of the university's integration. The university case, Holmes v. Danner, began in late 1960, after two black students, Charlayne Hunter (now the journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault) and Hamilton E. Holmes, were denied admission. The suit named Walter Danner, the university registrar. On Jan. 6, 1961, Judge Bootle ruled that the two students were ''fully qualified for immediate admission,'' adding that they ''would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color.'' Three days later, on Jan. 9, he abruptly stayed his own ruling, giving the university time to appeal. The students' lawyers, Donald L. Hollowell and Constance Baker Motley, immediately petitioned Judge Elbert P. Tuttle of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, who overturned the stay. On Jan. 10, the university took its case to Justice Hugo Black of the United States Supreme Court. It hoped for a sympathetic hearing: Justice Black was a former Ku Klux Klan member. But he handed the case to the full court, which upheld Judge Tuttle's ruling. On Jan. 11, after Mr. Holmes and Ms. Hunter began classes, rioting broke out on campus. The university suspended them, saying it was for their own safety. The next day, Judge Bootle ordered them reinstated. William Augustus Bootle, called Gus, was born on Aug. 19, 1902, in tiny Round O, S.C., near Walterboro. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1924 from Mercer University in Macon, and a law degree from it in 1925. He is survived by two sons, William Augustus Jr., of Warner Robins, Ga., and James, of Atlanta; a daughter, Ann Hall of Macon; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. His wife of 75 years, the former Virginia Childs, died in June. Judge Bootle was often asked why he subverted his own ruling in the University of Georgia case by granting the stay. He always said it was strictly routine. But in an interview with Dr. Pratt in 2001, he revealed a more considered aim. ''He wanted to get the Fifth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court to rule as soon as possible,'' Dr. Pratt said. ''This was all part of a larger calculated strategy.''"
33847,Arthur J. Goldberg Dies at 81; Ex-Justice and Envoy to U.N.,"Arthur J. Goldberg, who rose from humble beginnings in Chicago to become Secretary of Labor, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and then United States representative to the United Nations, was found dead yesterday morning in his apartment in Washington.","Arthur J. Goldberg, who rose from humble beginnings in Chicago to become Secretary of Labor, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and then United States representative to the United Nations, was found dead yesterday morning in his apartment in Washington. He was 81 years old. Dr. Michael Newman, Mr. Goldberg's physician, said the former Justice died late Thursday or early Friday of cardiac arrest from coronary artery disease. A maid found his body lying on a sofa. Prof. Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard Law School, who clerked for Justice Goldberg and was a longtime associate, said Mr. Goldberg had been active until his death on project to form a committee to monitor human rights developments in Eastern Europe and China. Turning Point in Life Associate Justice William J. Brennan, a fellow liberal who served with Justice Goldberg, said yesterday: ''The nation suffered a grevous loss in the death of Justice Goldberg. He served his nation brillantly as Secretary of Labor, Ambassador to the United Nations and Justice of the Supreme Court. Another great contribution was his work as a lawyer in bringing together the major labor organizations of the country.'' Warren E. Burger, the retired Chief Justice of the United States, said, ''As a Justice of the Supreme Court, he was a balanced and thoughtful jurist.'' A wrenching decision that was a turning point in his life occurred in 1965, when Mr. Goldberg gave up his lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court at President Lyndon B. Johnson's urging to assume the U.N. post. It was a decision he later said he regretted. On the one hand, as Mr. Goldberg said years later, he believed that as U.N. representative he could reverse the Johnson Administration's Vietnam policy and bring about peace negotiations. On the other hand, it meant giving up a judicial position in which Mr. Goldberg's admirers believed he would have made a greater mark on American history. ''In all candor,'' Mr. Goldberg said on the day he was named to the United Nations post, ''I would rather the President had not asked me to undertake this duty.'' Mr. Dershowitz said the Justice had told him, ''Although I would love nothing more than to live out my years on the Supreme Court, America has been too good to me for me to turn down its President.'' Three years later he resigned, citing frustrations and disappointments, including ''the limitations of the scope of my office'' in regard to getting the United Nations involved in a Vietnam peace effort. In 1970 Mr. Goldberg entered the race for Governor of New York as the Liberal-Democratic candidate, but he was soundly defeated by the Republican incumbent, Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Goldberg was an owlish, unimposing figure with remarkable energy and legal, judicial and negotiating skills. Johnson praised him in his memoirs as ''a skilled arbiter and a fair-minded man.'' It was in 1961 that the Chicago-born lawyer, then general counsel of the United Steelworkers of America, was named Secretary of Labor by President John F. Kennedy. In 1962, Kennedy named him to the Supreme Court. A Mover in Historic Merger The self-made son of an immigrant carter, Mr. Goldberg did much, as a union lawyer, to bring about the historic merger in 1955 of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. His legal work plunged him repeatedly into important decisions involving labor and management. Admirers recalled him as the leading labor lawyer of that day. When he was named general counsel of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1948, he became the chief of the staff of lawyers working for its vast membership. He was involved on behalf of labor in various court cases testing the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, which empowered the Government to obtain an 80-day injunction against strikes that endangered national health or safety. He was also the victor in an important 1949 court ruling affirming that pension issues were a proper subject for collective bargaining. After the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was formed, he became the main figure to draft rules on ethics. In 1959, he represented the steelworkers in negotiations during a strike that lasted more than 100 days and that led to a contract that was widely seen as a major gain for labor. As Labor Secretary, Mr. Goldberg was energetic in striving to settle labor disputes. He played a role in the Kennedy Administration's celebrated confrontation with the steel industry. Early in 1962 he helped bring about a noninflationary settlement between the steelworkers and the industry. He prodded the two sides by warning that a strike could seriously upset the nation's economy. But 10 days later the United States Steel Corporation decided on a price increase, angering Mr. Goldberg and Kennedy. Other steel concerns followed suit. Then, with Mr. Goldberg working behind the scenes, the Administration successfully applied pressure to get steel executives to back down on the price rise. He met with Roger M. Blough, chairman of U.S. Steel, on a day when another steel company revoked its own price increase, and soon U.S. Steel also yielded. Afterward, on the Supreme Court, Mr. Goldberg quickly became influential as an innovative judicial thinker whose arrival, to replace the more conservative Felix Frankfurter, tilted the Court toward liberal activism. Authorities have offered different explanations of why Johnson chose Mr. Goldberg for the U.N. The President emphasized his desire to name a distinguished public figure to the post previously held by Adlai E. Stevenson. Others noted Johnson's wish to name his friend Abe Fortas to the Court. Mr Fortas was named to the seat after Mr. Goldberg stepped down. A Reluctant Farewell Mr. Goldberg said he was reluctant to leave the judiciary for the uncertain world of diplomacy. In making the shift, he became one of the few Supreme Court Justices to quit for reasons other than retirement. Professor Dershowitz said Johnson strongly appealed to Mr. Goldberg's patriotism. ''My President has told me that I can save American soldiers' lives'' by helping to work out a Vietnam peace arrangement, the Justice told his former clerk. He did make a contribution, largely through dextrous negotiations with Soviet diplomats. But he achieved far less than he had hoped, which was to have a major role in ending the Vietnam War. After he left the United Nations, he served as president of the American Jewish Committee, the nationwide human rights organization, in 1968 and 1969, and became a member of the Manhattan law firm of Paul, Weiss, Goldberg, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. In 1970, after opinion polls suggested that he would be a strong candidate, he entered the race for Governor of New York. But he proved to be a lackluster campaigner and he was easily defeated by Mr. Rockefeller, a long-entrenched power in state politics. In 1971, Mr. Goldberg returned to Washington, where he resumed his career. He was called in on international arbitration cases and served in 1977 and 1978 in the Carter Administration as a United States Ambassador-at-large. In that role he was chairman of the United States delegation to a follow-up conference, in 1977 in Belgrade, on the 1975 Helsinki agreements on human rights. At the 35-nation gathering, he voiced vigorous criticism of Eastern bloc nations on human rights. That advocacy echoed the lusty assertiveness of his early years, as Labor Secretary, when the Federal Government played an interventionist role in some labor-management matters. Mr. Goldberg felt the Government had an obligation to affirm the importance to the nation of resolving crucial labor-management contract talks with implications for the state of the economy. With Kennedy's support he acted on his own conviction that the Government itself should be vigorous in trying to settle labor-management conflicts that jeopardize national interests. Early in his tenure as Labor Secretary, he helped resolve a New York harbor tugboat strike. He also intervened, and became a successful arbitrator, in a dispute between the Metropolitan Opera and orchestra members. The arrival of Mr. Goldberg - a liberal, though not a rigid one - on the Supreme Court, then led by Earl Warren, proved to be a watershed. It led, in the opinion of most constitutional experts at the time, to a change in the course of the Court's rulings. While Frankfurter was still on the Court, he was the leader of a five-Justice majority that favored judicial restraint, including respect for states' rights and deference to Capitol Hill. But as an Associate Justice Mr. Goldberg became a member of a group, usually constituting a cohesive majority of the nine Justices, that extended the Court's writ into what had been deemed the spheres of the states or of Congress. This majority group was often termed activist or liberal. As a Justice, Mr. Goldberg was also innovative. In 1964, in perhaps his most notable opinion, he wrote for the Court's majority in the case of Escobedo v. Illinois, striking down a conviction in a murder case in which the defendant had been denied the right to confer with his lawyer after his arrest. Similar decisions ensued, and so did reappraisals of much of the nation's criminal justice system. Many police executives and prosecutors complained that the rulings had placed excessive restrictions on them. Despite Mr. Goldberg's misgivings about leaving the Court for the United Nations, he had some successes as the United States representative there. Some admirers felt his most significant achievement was his role in drafting Security Council Resolution 242, which was passed in November 1967 after the Middle East war that year. The resolution calls for ''a just and lasting peace in the Middle East,'' including ''withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories of recent conflict'' and respect for the right of ''every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.'' The measure has been a cornerstone ever since in diplomatic efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. But he did not succeed in getting the United Nations involved in an attempt to bring about an acceptable end to the confrontation in Vietnam. In addition, behind the scenes, Mr. Goldberg had grave differences with Johnson over Vietnam policies. Exit From Vietnam But Mr. Goldberg did figure modestly in the history of how the United States came to get out of Vietnam. In mid-March 1968, a time when, as Mr. Johnson put it in his book ''The Vantage Point,'' ''our total situation in Vietnam was under comprehensive review,'' Mr. Goldberg sent Johnson a memorandum. It suggested that the United States stop ''the aerial and naval bombardment of North Vietnam for the limited time necessary to determine whether Hanoi will negotiate in good faith'' in peace talks. ''I read the memo carefully,'' Johnson wrote. ''Goldberg made a strong case for a total bombing halt, but not strong enough. I could not take the risk of such a move at that time. I continued to believe that the North Vietnamese would interpret it as a clear sign of weakness - an indication that we wanted to stop fighting and come home.'' On March 20, 1968, Mr. Goldberg pressed his proposal at a meeting with Johnson and Presidential advisers. He did so at a time when there was much talk within the Administration of how to foster Vietnam peace talks. His suggestion was not acted on at the time, but 11 days later Johnson announced an unconditional and sweeping, but less than total, cutback in the bombing. Talks between the United States and North Vietnam ensued in Paris, and Johnson eventually stopped all bombing of the north. Blind Horse and Wagon The roles that Mr. Goldberg played in Presidential policy making and international affairs were remote from the world of his boyhood. Arthur Joseph Goldberg's was born Aug. 8, 1908, in Chicago, the youngest of eight children of Joseph and Rebecca Goldberg, both of whom were born in Russia. The elder Mr. Goldberg, a former peddler, owned a blind horse and a wagon and delivered produce to hotels. After studying at Crane Junior College and De Paul University, Arthur Goldberg entered Northwestern University Law School, graduating at the head of its class of 1929 and earning a doctorate, summa cum laude, in 1930. He went on to practice labor law in Chicago until 1948, with time out for war service from 1942 to 1944, serving with with the Office of Strategic Services and as an Army officer. From 1948 to 1961, Mr. Goldberg was the Washington-based general counsel of the United Steelworkers and was active in negotiations toward settling major strikes in the steel industry. He was also general counsel of the Congress of Industrial Organizations from 1948 to 1955 and in that capacity worked toward its merger with the American Federation of Labor, He was special counsel to the industrial union department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. from 1955 until 1961. Mr. Goldberg was married in 1931 to Dorothy Kurgans. She died in 1988. He is survived by a daughter, Barbara Cramer of Chicago; a son, Robert, of Anchorage, and six grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are incomplete, but Ralph DeStefano, director of Gawler's Funeral Home, said Mr. Goldberg would be buried in Arlington National Cemetery."

He was 84 and suffered from a long illness, an army spokesman said. Colonel Cabanillas was in charge of military intelligence in 1956, when he received orders from the junta leader, Gen. Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, to transport the embalmed body of Mrs. Peron -- the legendary former First Lady -- to Italy. It was buried in a secret grave in Milan under a false name. So beloved was Mrs. Peron, who died of cancer in 1952, that the military leaders who overthrew her husband, Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, in 1955, had confiscated her body to keep opposing political forces from using it to rally the masses. For 15 years, even long after his retirement from the military, Colonel Cabanillas was the only person who knew the exact location of Mrs. Peron's corpse. He divulged his secret only on the orders of Gen. Alejandro A. Lanusse, who became Argentina's military leader in 1971. In exchange for Juan Peron's blessing from exile, General Lanusse agreed to hold free elections, restore Mr. Peron's citizenship and turn over Eva Peron's body to him. In 1973, Colonel Cabanillas returned to Italy to oversee the exhumation of Mrs. Peron's body, which today is buried in her family's tomb under three plates of steel in the Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. Colonel Cabanillas was one of the main sources for the best-selling novel ""Santa Evita,"" (1996, Knopf) by the Argentine author Tomas Eloy Martinez. The book chronicles the long battle for possession of Eva Peron's remains and their journey halfway around the world and back before finally coming to rest. Mr. Martinez said that Colonel Cabanillas was the source for passages in his book that detail the problems the military had in hiding Mrs. Peron's corpse. According to the book, wherever the military hid the body, even in the most secure military buildings, admirers would find it and repeatedly place flowers and candles nearby. So the military eventually sent the body to Italy. ""He certainly knew how to keep a secret,"" Mr. Martinez said of Colonel Cabanillas, whom he described as a quiet, reserved man. ""Since he was the only one who knew where Evita's body was located, Cabanillas had a lot of power in his hands, and it's incredible that he did not use it."" Asked why Colonel Cabanillas came forward after remaining silent for so many years, Mr. Martinez said the retired colonel told him that it was time to reveal the truth about what happened to Eva Peron's body, especially since there was no longer a great political importance attached to it. Colonel Cabanillas was born in 1914 in Cordoba, Argentina, a province just north of Buenos Aires. He entered the army in 1934 and after being trained as an engineer, he moved quickly up the ranks. He was a diehard anti-Peronist, and he participated in the 1955 coup that toppled Juan Peron's second Government. After his retirement from the military in 1959, Colonel Cabanillas founded a private security firm that provided protection for politicians and business executives. Local newspapers said he is survived by three children -- Marita, Eduardo Rodolfo and Marcela, all of Buenos Aires."

He was 87. Mr. Gladstone's death was confirmed by his daughter Robin Wilson. Mr. Gladstone's books included ''The Complete Manual of Home Repair'' (1969). It led to appearances on radio and television programs, including the hit program ''To Tell the Truth.'' The celebrity panelists tried to guess his line of work, and failed. After forming his own paint contracting and retail business on Long Island, Mr. Gladstone became a freelance columnist for The Times in 1955. He became a copy editor in 1970 and later edited the paper's home-improvement coverage until retiring in 1987. His columns had various titles, including ''Home Improvement'' and ''Home Clinic.'' Bernard Gladstone was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 26, 1921. He wrote his first article at 16 for Popular Science. In 1942, after a year at the City College of New York, he enlisted in the Army. He served in the Army Air Corps in England, and was discharged in 1946 as a lieutenant for injuries sustained in a wartime accident. He retired to Bradenton County, Fla., in 1987 but continued writing columns for The New York Times Syndicate until 1991. Besides his daughter Robin, Mr. Gladstone is survived by another daughter, Carol Arava, from his first marriage, to Olga Glasser; his second wife, Sandra Zalbowitz; and four stepchildren, Amy, Laurie, David and Daniel."
18067,"Milton Friedman, the Champion Of Free Markets, Is Dead at 94","Milton Friedman, the grandmaster of free-market economic theory in the postwar era and a prime force in the movement of nations toward less government and greater reliance on individual responsibility, died yesterday.","Milton Friedman, the grandmaster of free-market economic theory in the postwar era and a prime force in the movement of nations toward less government and greater reliance on individual responsibility, died yesterday. He was 94 and lived in San Francisco. His death was confirmed by Robert Fanger, a spokesman for the Milton and Rose D. Friedman Foundation in Indianapolis. Conservative and liberal colleagues alike viewed Mr. Friedman, a Nobel laureate, as one of the 20th century's leading economic scholars, on a par with giants like John Maynard Keynes and Paul Samuelson. Flying the flag of economic conservatism, Mr. Friedman led the postwar challenge to the hallowed theories of Lord Keynes, the British economist who maintained that governments had a duty to help capitalistic economies through periods of recession and to prevent boom times from exploding into high inflation. In Mr. Friedman's view, government had the opposite obligation: to keep its hands off the economy, to let the free market do its work. He was a spiritual heir to Adam Smith, the 18th-century founder of the science of economics and proponent of laissez-faire: that government governs best which governs least. The only economic lever that Mr. Friedman would allow government to use was the one that controlled the supply of money -- a monetarist view that had gone out of favor when he embraced it in the 1950s. He went on to record a signal achievement, predicting the unprecedented combination of rising unemployment and rising inflation that came to be called stagflation. His work earned him the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1976. Rarely, colleagues said, did anyone have such impact on his own profession and on government. Though he never served officially in the halls of power, he was around them, as an adviser and theorist. ''Among economic scholars, Milton Friedman had no peer,'' Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday. ''The direct and indirect influences of his thinking on contemporary monetary economics would be difficult to overstate.'' Professor Friedman also fueled the rise of the Chicago School of economics, a conservative group within the department of economics at the University of Chicago. He and his colleagues became a counterforce to their liberal peers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, influencing close to a dozen American winners of the Nobel in economics. It was not only Mr. Friedman's antistatist and free-market views that held sway over his colleagues. There was also his willingness to create a place where independent thinkers could be encouraged to take unconventional stands as long as they were prepared to do battle to support them. ''Most economics departments are like country clubs,'' said James J. Heckman, a Chicago faculty member and Nobel laureate. ''But at Chicago you are only as good as your last paper.'' Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said of Mr. Friedman in an interview Tuesday: ''From a longer-term point of view, it's his academic achievements which will have lasting import. But I would not dismiss the profound impact he has already had on the American public's view.'' To Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Friedman came along at an opportune time. The Keynesian consensus among economists, he said -- one that had worked well from the 1930s -- could not explain the stagflation of the 1970s. But he also said that Mr. Friedman had made a broader political argument: that you have to have economic freedom to have political freedom. Mr. Friedman had a gift for communicating complicated ideas in simple and lucid ways, and it served him well as the author or co-author of more than a dozen books, as a columnist for Newsweek from 1966 to 1983 and even as the star of a public television series. He was a bridge between the academic and popular worlds, and his broader impact stemmed in large part from the fact that he was preaching a gospel of capitalism that fit neatly into American self-perceptions. He was pushing on an open door. A Staunch Libertarian As a libertarian, Mr. Friedman advocated legalizing drugs and generally opposed public education and the state's power to license doctors, car drivers and others. He was criticized for those views, but he stood by them, arguing that prohibiting, regulating or licensing human behavior either does not work or creates inefficient bureaucracies. Mr. Friedman insisted that unimpeded private competition produced better results than government systems. ''Try talking French with someone who studied it in public school,'' he argued, ''then with a Berlitz graduate.'' Once, when accused of going overboard in his antistatism, he said, ''In every generation, there's got to be somebody who goes the whole way, and that's why I believe as I do.'' In the long period of prosperity after World War II, when Keynesian economics was riding high in the West, Mr. Friedman alone warned of trouble ahead, asserting that policies based on Keynesian theory were part of the problem. Even as he was being dismissed as an economic ''flat-earther,'' he predicted in the 1960s that the end of the boom was at hand. Expect unemployment to grow, he said, and inflation to rise, at the same time. The prediction was borne out in the 1970s. It was Paul Samuelson who labeled the phenomenon stagflation. Mr. Friedman's analysis and prediction were regarded as a stunning intellectual accomplishment and contributed to his earning the Nobel for his monetary theories. He was also cited for his analyses of consumer savings and of the causes of the Great Depression: he blamed the Federal Reserve, accusing it of bad monetary policy and saying it had bungled early chances for recovery. His prestige and that of the Chicago school soared, and his analysis of the Depression changed the way that the Fed thought about monetary policy. Government leaders like President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain were heavily influenced by his views. So was the quietly building opposition to communism within the East bloc. As the end of the century approached, Professor Friedman said events had made his views seem only more valid than when he had first formed them. One event was the fall of communism. In an introduction to the 50th-anniversary edition of Friedrich A. Hayek's book predicting totalitarian consequences from collectivist planning, ''The Road to Serfdom,'' Mr. Friedman wrote it was clear that ''progress could be achieved only in an order in which government activity is limited primarily to establishing the framework with which individuals are free to pursue their own objectives.'' ''The free market is the only mechanism that has ever been discovered for achieving participatory democracy,'' he said. Professor Friedman was acknowledged to be a brilliant statistician and logician. To his critics, however, he sometimes pushed his data too far. To them, the debate over the advantages or disadvantages of an unregulated free market was far from over. Milton Friedman was born in Brooklyn on July 31, 1912, the last of four children and only son of Jeno S. Friedman and Sarah Landau Friedman. His parents worked briefly in New York sweatshops, then moved their family to Rahway, N.J., where they opened a clothing store. Mr. Friedman's father died in his son's senior year at Rahway High School. Young Milton later waited on tables and clerked in stores to supplement a scholarship he had earned at Rutgers University. He entered Rutgers in 1929, the year the stock market crashed and the Depression began. Mr. Friedman attributed his success to ''accidents'': the immigration of his teen-age parents from Czechoslovakia, enabling him to be an American and not the citizen of a Soviet-bloc state; the skill of a high-school geometry teacher who showed him a connection between Keats's ''Ode to a Grecian Urn'' and the Pythagorean theorem, allowing him to see mathematical beauty; the receipt of a scholarship that enabled him to attend Rutgers and there have Arthur F. Burns and Homer Jones as teachers. He said Mr. Burns, who later became chairman of the Federal Reserve, instilled in him a passion for scientific integrity and accuracy in economics; Mr. Jones interested him in monetary policy and a graduate school career at Chicago. In his first economic-theory class at Chicago, he was the beneficiary of another accident -- the fact that his last name began with an ''F.'' The class was seated alphabetically, and he was placed next to Rose Director, a master's-degree candidate from Portland, Ore. That seating arrangement shaped his whole life, he said. He married Ms. Director six years later. And she, after becoming an important economist in her own right, helped Mr. Friedman form his ideas and maintain his intellectual rigor. After he became something of a celebrity, Mr. Friedman said, many people became reluctant to challenge him directly. ''They can't come right out and say something stinks,'' he said. ''Rose can.'' In 1998, he and his wife published a memoir, ''Two Lucky People'' (University of Chicago Press), in which they reveled in ''having intellectual children throughout the world.'' His wife is among his survivors. They also include a son, David, and a daughter, Janet Martel, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. A Fateful Class That fateful class at the University of Chicago also introduced him to Jacob Viner, regarded as a great theorist and historian of economic thought. Professor Viner convinced Mr. Friedman that economic theory need not be a mere set of disjointed propositions but rather could be developed into a logical and coherent prescription for action. Mr. Friedman won a fellowship to do his doctoral work at Columbia, where the emphasis was on statistics and empirical evidence. He studied there with Simon Kuznets, another American Nobel laureate. The two turned Mr. Friedman's thesis into a book, ''Income From Independent Professional Practice.'' It was the first of more than a dozen books that Mr. Friedman wrote alone or with others. It was also the first of many ''Friedman controversies.'' One finding of the book was that the American Medical Association exerted monopolistic pressure on the incomes of doctors; as a result, the authors said, patients were unable to reap the benefits of lower fees from any real price competition among doctors. The A.M.A., after obtaining a galley copy of the book, challenged that conclusion and forced the publisher to delay publication. But the authors did not budge. The book was eventually published, unchanged. During the first two years of World War II, Mr. Friedman was an economist in the Treasury Department's division of taxation. ''Rose has never forgiven me for the part I played in devising and developing withholding for the income tax,'' he said. ''There is no doubt that it would not have been possible to collect the amount of taxes imposed during World War II without withholding taxes at the source. ''But it is also true,'' he went on, ''that the existence of withholding has made it possible for taxes to be higher after the war than they otherwise could have been. So I have a good deal of sympathy for the view that, however necessary withholding may have been for wartime purposes, its existence has had some negative effects in the postwar period.'' After the war, he returned to the University of Chicago, becoming a full professor in 1948 and commencing his campaign against Keynesian economics. Robert M. Solow of M.I.T., a Nobel laureate who often disagreed with Mr. Friedman, called him one of ''the greatest debaters of all time.'' But his wisecracking style could infuriate opponents. Mr. Samuelson, also of M.I.T., who was not above wisecracking himself, had a standard line in his economics classes that always brought down the house: ''Just because Milton Friedman says it doesn't mean that it's necessarily untrue.'' But Professor Samuelson said he never joked in class unless he was serious -- that his friend and opponent was, in fact, often right when at first he sounded wrong. Mr. Friedman's opposition to rent control after World War II, for example, incurred the wrath of many colleagues. They took it as an unpatriotic criticism of economic policies that had been successful in helping the nation mobilize for war. Later, Mr. Samuelson said, ''probably 98 percent of them would agree that he was right.'' In the early 1950s, Mr. Friedman started flogging a ''decomposing horse,'' as Mrs. Thatcher's chief economic adviser, Alan Waters, later put it. The horse that most economists thought long dead was the monetarist theory that the supply of money in circulation and readily accessible in banks was the dominant force -- or in Mr. Friedman's view, the only force -- that should be used in shaping the economy. In the 1963 book ''A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960,'' which he wrote with Anna Jacobson Schwartz, Mr. Friedman compiled statistics to buttress his theory that recessions, as well as the Great Depression, had been preceded by declines in the money supply. And it was an oversupply, he argued, that caused inflation. In the late 1960s, Mr. Friedman used his knowledge of empirical evidence and statistics to calculate that Keynesian government programs had the effect of constantly increasing the money supply, a practice that over time was seriously inflationary. Paul Krugman, a Princeton University economist and Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, said Mr. Friedman then managed ''one of the decisive intellectual achievements of postwar economics,'' predicting the combination of rising unemployment and rising inflation that came to be called stagflation. In this regard, his Nobel award cited his contribution to the now famous concept ''the natural rate of unemployment.'' Under this thesis, the unemployment rate cannot be driven below a certain level without provoking an acceleration in the inflation rate. Price inflation was linked to wage inflation, and wage inflation depended on the inflationary expectations of employers and workers in their bargaining. A spiral developed. Wages and prices rose until expectations came into line with reality, usually at the natural rate of unemployment. Once that rate is achieved, any attempt to drive down unemployment through expansionary government policies is inflationary, according to Mr. Friedman's thesis, which he unveiled in 1968. For years economists have tried to pinpoint the elusive natural rate, without much success, particularly in recent years. Mr. Friedman was right on the big economic issue of that time -- inflation. And his prescription -- to have the governors of the Federal Reserve System keep the money supply growing steadily without big fluctuations -- figured in the thinking of policy makers around the world in the 1980s. A Retort to Kennedy Mr. Friedman also pursued his attack on Keynesianism in a more general way. He warned that a government allowed to regulate the economy could not be trusted to keep its hands off individual liberties. He had first been exposed to this line of attack through his association with Mr. Hayek, who was predicting in the early 1940s that communism would lead inevitably to totalitarianism and the crushing of individual rights. In an introduction to a 1971 German edition, Professor Friedman called Mr. Hayek's book ''a revelation particularly to the young men and women who had been in the armed forces during the war.'' ''Their recent experience had enhanced their appreciation of the value and meaning of individual freedom,'' he wrote. In 1962, Mr. Friedman took on President John F. Kennedy's popular inaugural exhortation: ''Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.'' In an introduction to his classic book ''Capitalism and Freedom,'' a collection of his writings and lectures, he said President Kennedy had got it wrong: You should ask neither. ''What your country can do for you,'' Mr. Friedman said, implies that the government is the patron, the citizen the ward; and ''what you can do for your country'' assumes that the government is the master, the citizen the servant. Rather, he said, you should ask, ''What I and my compatriots can do through government to help discharge our individual responsibilities, to achieve our several goals and purposes, and above all protect our freedom.'' It was not that Mr. Friedman believed in no government. He is credited with devising the negative income tax, which in a modern variant -- the earned-income tax credit -- increases the incomes of the working poor. He also argued that government should give the poor vouchers to attend the private schools he thought superior to public ones. In forums he would spar over the role of government with his more liberal adversaries, including John Kenneth Galbraith, who was also a longtime friend (and who died in April 2006). The two would often share a stage, presenting a study in contrasts as much visual as intellectual: Mr. Friedman stood 5 feet 3; Mr. Galbraith, 6 feet 8. Though he had helped ignite the conservative rebellion after World War II, together with intellectuals like Russell Kirk, William F. Buckley Jr. and Ayn Rand, Mr. Friedman had little or no influence on the administrations of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. President Nixon, in fact, once described himself as a Keynesian. It was frustrating period for Mr. Friedman. He said that during the Nixon years the talk was still of urban crises solvable only by government programs that he was convinced would make things worse, or of environmental problems produced by ''rapacious businessmen who were expected to discharge their social responsibility instead of simply operating their enterprises to make the most profit.'' Rising With Reagan But then, after the 1970s stagflation, with Keynesian tools seemingly broken or outmoded, and with Ronald Reagan headed for the White House, Mr. Friedman's hour arrived. His power and influence were acknowledged and celebrated in Washington. With his wife, in 1978 he brought out a best-selling general-interest book, ''Free to Choose,'' and went on an 18-month tour, from Hong Kong to Ottumwa, Iowa, preaching that government regulation and interference in the free market was the stifling bane of modern society. The tour became the subject and Mr. Friedman the star of a 10-part PBS series, ''Free to Choose,'' in 1980. In 1983, having retired from teaching, he became a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Five years later he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science. The economic expansion in the 1980s resulted from the Reagan administration's lowered tax rates and deregulation, Professor Friedman said. But then the tide turned again. The expansion, he argued, was halted when President George H. W. Bush imposed a ''reverse-Reaganomics'' tax increase. What was worse, by the mid-1980s, as the finance and banking industries began undergoing upheavals and money began shifting unpredictably, Mr. Friedman's own monetarist predictions -- of what would happen to the economy and inflation as a result of specific increases in the money supply -- failed to hold up. Confidence in his monetarism theory waned. Prof. Robert Solow of M.I.T., a Nobel laureate himself, and other liberal economists continued to raise questions about Mr. Friedman's theories: Did not President Reagan, and by extension Professor Friedman, they asked, revert to Keynesianism once in power? ''The boom that lasted from 1982 to 1990 was engineered by the Reagan administration in a straightforward Keynesian way by rising spending and lowered taxes, a classic case of an expansionary budget deficit,'' Mr. Solow said. ''In fairness to Milton, however, it should be said that one of the reasons for his wanting a tax reduction was to force the spending cuts that he presumed would follow.'' Professor Samuelson said that ''Milton Friedman thought of himself as a man of science but was in fact more full of passion than he knew.'' Mr. Friedman remained the guiding light to American conservatives. It was he, for example, who provided the economic theory behind ''prescriptions for action,'' as his onetime professor, Jacob Viner, put it, like the landslide Republican victory in the off-year Congressional elections of 1994. By then Professor Friedman had grown into a giant of economics abroad as well. He was sharply criticized for his role in providing intellectual guidance on economic matters to the military regime in Chile that engineered a coup in the early 1970s against the democratically elected president, Salvador Allende. But for Mr. Friedman that was just a bump in the road. In Vietnam, where the Constitution was amended in 1986 to guarantee the rights of private property, the writings of Mr. Friedman were circulated at the highest levels of government. ''Privatize,'' he told Chinese scholars at a meeting at Fudan University in Shanghai; and he told those in Moscow and elsewhere in Eastern Europe: ''Speed the conversion of state-run enterprises to private ownership.'' They did. Mr. Friedman had long since ceased to be called a flat-earther by anyone. ''What was really so important about him,'' said W. Allen Wallis, a former classmate and later faculty colleague at the University of Chicago, ''was his tremendous basic intelligence, his ingenuity, perseverance -- his way of getting to the bottom of things, of looking at them in a new way.''"

She was 93. She died after a series of strokes, said a friend, Doris Bacon. Mrs. Backus, a leggy redhead with a droll sense of humor, started her career as a showgirl in the Broadway revues of the 1920's. Later she took on character parts in television sitcoms like ''Blondie,'' in which she played the matronly Cora Dithers opposite her husband, who played Dagwood's irascible boss, Mr. Dithers. Together Henny and Jim Backus wrote several blithe books about their marriage, including ''What Are You Doing After the Orgy?'' (1962), ''Backus Strikes Back'' (1984) and ''Forgive Us Our Digressions'' (1988). According to one of their books, ''Only When I Laugh'' (1965), it was Mrs. Backus who persuaded Jim to use the upper-crust drawl that eventually landed him the part of the millionaire Thurston Howell III on ''Gilligan's Island.'' ''Any Harvard man I ever went out with sounded like that,'' she explained, ''like he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and they forgot to take it out.'' Henrietta Kaye, who later went by Henriette, was born in Brooklyn on March 21, 1911, and studied art at Cooper Union. Though her sculptures sold well, she preferred acting and would linger outside stage doors hoping to be hired. She appeared in several musicals and during the Depression she joined an acting troupe sponsored by the federal Works Progress Administration. She married Mr. Backus in 1943 and became his caretaker 35 years later, after he developed Parkinson's disease. She described what she learned in ''Care for the Caretaker,'' an advice book published in 1999. She is survived by a sister, Florence Gittleman of Manhattan, and a brother, Irving A.

7849,Rabbi Moses Teitelbaum Is Dead at 91,"Moses Teitelbaum, the grand rabbi of the Satmar Hasidim, one of the world's largest and fastest-growing sects of Orthodox Jews, died yesterday in Manhattan.","Moses Teitelbaum, the grand rabbi of the Satmar Hasidim, one of the world's largest and fastest-growing sects of Orthodox Jews, died yesterday in Manhattan. He was 91 and lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. His family, through spokesmen, said he died at Mount Sinai Medical Center, where he had been hospitalized for a number of ailments. Rabbi Teitelbaum became leader of the Satmars in 1980, succeeding his uncle Joel Teitelbaum. In Hasidism, a mystical brand of Orthodox Judaism, the grand rabbi is revered as a kinglike link to God, holding vast sway over members' lives. Joel Teitelbaum had transplanted the tattered remnants of Satmar from post-Holocaust Europe to Williamsburg, giving the sect new life. Under Moses Teitelbaum, Satmar more than doubled its ranks, to an estimated 100,000 worldwide, building schools and expanding real estate holdings that are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Rabbi Solomon Gelbman, a Satmar historian, said that Rabbi Teitelbaum, known to his followers by his Hebrew name, Moshe, had likened himself to the biblical Jacob, who considered himself custodian of the great works begun by Isaac and Abraham before him. ''Jacob said, 'I'm not digging any new wells; I'm just watching the wells that the father and the grandfather dug, that they should continue to produce clean water,' '' Rabbi Gelbman said. ''Rabbi Moshe said the same thing: 'Rabbi Joel dug the wells. I'm just tending them.' '' The last years of Rabbi Teitelbaum's leadership were marred by a bitter succession dispute -- still unresolved -- between two of his sons, Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum and Rabbi Zalmen Teitelbaum. The feud began in 1999, when the grand rabbi chose Zalmen, his third son, to take over the sect's main congregation in Williamsburg. He had previously named Aaron, the eldest son, to run the second-largest Satmar congregation, in Kiryas Joel, N.Y. Supporters of the first-born brother never accepted Zalmen's appointment as legitimate, and lawsuits followed, as did sometimes violent confrontations between partisans in the streets and synagogues of Williamsburg. Even as Rabbi Teitelbaum lay ill at Mount Sinai in recent weeks, Rabbi Aaron and Rabbi Zalmen were negotiating through intermediaries over who would speak at his funeral, and in what order. Thousands attended the ceremony last night in Williamsburg. In addition to Aaron and Zalmen, Rabbi Teitelbaum is survived by his wife, Pessel Leah; two other sons, Lipa and Shulem, also rabbis; two daughters, Bracha Meisels and Hendy Halberstam; and at least 86 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The Satmars, who originated in Satu Mare, Romania, are among the more isolationist of the Hasidic sects, which are named for the Eastern European towns that gave birth to them. Unlike most Hasidim, Satmars are staunchly anti-Zionist. Moses Teitelbaum, named for the 18th-century founder of the Satmar dynasty, Moshe Teitelbaum, was born into rabbinic royalty in Ujfeherto, in what is now eastern Hungary, on Nov. 17, 1914. When the region fell to the Nazis, Rabbi Teitelbaum, then teaching at a yeshiva, was sent to Auschwitz with his wife and three children. Only the rabbi survived. After the war, he remarried and moved to the United States, where Joel Teitelbaum had re-established the sect. Moses founded a congregation in Borough Park, Brooklyn. After Joel Teitelbaum died childless in 1979, the Satmars named Moses the rebbe, and he moved into the sect's seat in Williamsburg. By the time Moses died, the Williamsburg enclave had a population of about 35,000, spilling over into adjacent neighborhoods. The settlement in Kiryas Joel, in Orange County, had grown to more than 15,000 people after being established by a few settlers in the last years of Joel's life. Moses Teitelbaum ''took a moderately successful Hasidic group and really nourished its growth,'' said David M. Pollock, associate executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council. ''It's now the largest Hasidic group in the United States.'' If the Satmar schools in New York were a public school system, it would be the fourth-largest system in the state, after those of New York City, Buffalo and Rochester. Rabbi Teitelbaum's leadership was such that even as the sect has threatened to split over the succession battle, it has continued to grow, said Samuel C. Heilman, a distinguished professor of sociology at Queens College. ''One of the signs of the Satmars' strength,'' Professor Heilman said, ''is that in spite of this internal conflict, they're not on the verge of falling apart.''"

Rowley, a physician who four decades ago became the first person to show a conclusive link between certain genetic abnormalities and certain cancers, died on Tuesday at her home in Chicago. She was 88. The death, from complications of ovarian cancer, was announced by the University of Chicago, where Dr. Rowley was the Blum-Riese distinguished service professor of medicine, molecular genetics and cell biology, and human genetics. Dr. Rowley, described by The New York Times in 2011 as ''the matriarch of modern cancer genetics,'' made her pathbreaking discovery in 1972, when she found that a particular type of leukemia could result when two chromosomes abnormally exchanged genetic material. Her findings helped establish cancer as a genetic disease. They also made possible the development of targeted drug therapies for specific cancers. For her work, Dr. Rowley received the Lasker Award, given for distinguished contributions to medical science; the National Medal of Science from President Bill Clinton; and the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama, among many other honors. Janet Davison was born in New York City on April 5, 1925, and at 2 moved with her family to Chicago. At 15, she entered Hutchins College of the University of Chicago, which let gifted high school students start college. After receiving her bachelor's degree at 19, she was accepted to the university's medical school but was told she would have to wait nine months to enroll: the school had already accepted its quota of women for the year -- three in a class of 65. She earned her M.D. from Chicago in 1948 and that year married a classmate, Dr. Donald Rowley. The mother of four young sons before long, she worked part time at a local clinic for children with Down syndrome. The prospect of a research career, Dr. Rowley later said, did not occur to her. ''I actually thought I had it made working three days a week,'' she said in a 2009 interview. ''I could take care of my children, garden, weave and go to museums.'' Then, in 1961, Dr. Rowley joined her husband on a sabbatical year at Oxford University. Because Down syndrome was known to be caused by a chromosomal abnormality, she chose to spend her year there studying new methods of chromosome analysis. Returning to Chicago, she begged the university for a room, a microscope and sufficient salary to pay a babysitter. The director of the laboratory that offered her space was an authority on leukemia, and Dr. Rowley began hunting for chromosomal anomalies in genetic samples from his patients. While genetic abnormalities had long been known to cause other diseases, Dr. Rowley would be the first to show that they were also a cause -- and not merely a consequence, as had been supposed -- of cancer. Her discovery took 10 years of peering through the microscope: at the time it was hard to tell chromosomes apart, even under magnification. ''This was less than a decade after Watson and Crick's discovery,'' Dr. Rowley told The Times in 2011, referring to James D. Watson and Francis Crick, the biologists who discovered the structure of DNA in 1953. ''We were only beginning to have a notion of what DNA was like. There weren't the right tools yet to stain it, cut it apart, examine and manipulate it.'' Dr. Rowley's first significant advance came in 1970, on another sabbatical at Oxford. There she was introduced to a chemical staining technique, newly developed in Sweden, that made chromosomes appear striated and, as a result, easier to differentiate. She stained and studied an array of chromosomes from patients with blood cancers, photographing the resulting images. Back in Chicago, she cut the photos into tiny fragments, with each fragment showing a chromosome in isolation -- ''paper dolls,'' her children called them. One day in 1972, Dr. Rowley cut up a sheaf of photos from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia, known as A.M.L. She laid the fragments out, chromosome by chromosome, on her dining table and ordered the children not to sneeze. Aligned, the photos told a story of mutation. As Dr. Rowley noticed, two chromosomes had inappropriately swapped genetic material: a piece of chromosome 8 was now on chromosome 21, and vice versa. Examining photos from other A.M.L. patients, she saw that nearly every set showed the identical genetic swap. Surely, she thought, other researchers had observed this before. She rushed to the library. ''They hadn't,'' Dr. Rowley told The Associated Press in 1988. ''It was one of the greatest moments of my life.'' She soon identified another swap, between chromosomes 9 and 22, which resulted in chronic myelogenous leukemia, or C.M.L. It was then so unorthodox to regard cancer as a genetic disease that ''I got sort of amused tolerance at the beginning,'' Dr. Rowley later said. In 1977, she and her colleagues uncovered a third swap -- between chromosomes 15 and 17 -- which caused acute promyelocytic leukemia. ''That showed what we'd observed with the other two wasn't an anomaly,'' Dr. Rowley told The Times in 2011. ''The third finding made me a believer.'' In chromosomes that had undergone the swaps -- known in medical parlance as translocations -- genes regulating processes like cell growth and cell division were no longer where they ought to be. As a result, cancer could arise. Over the years, researchers have identified hundreds more translocations linked to specific cancers. The discoveries have given rise to drugs that target the genetic defects underpinning the cancers while sparing healthy cells. Among the most successful of these drugs is Gleevec, used to treat C.M.L. Before its development, C.M.L. patients typically lived three to five years after diagnosis. Today, 90 percent are considered cured and have a normal life span. Dr. Rowley's husband, a noted pathologist at the University of Chicago, died this year; their eldest son, Donald, died in 1983. Survivors include three sons, David, Robert and Roger, and five grandchildren. Her other awards include the Japan Prize and a lifetime achievement award from the American Association for Cancer Research. From 2002 to 2009, she served on President George W. Bush's Council on Bioethics. Despite her laurels, Dr. Rowley by all accounts remained almost preternaturally modest. ''People accuse me of being too humble,'' she told The Times in 2011. ''But looking down a microscope at banded chromosomes is not rocket science.''"

She was 95. The cause was pneumonia, a spokeswoman for the home said. Ms. Gray and Mr. Denison, who died in 1998, achieved considerable renown during their intertwined acting careers -- she for usually playing the ladylike, suffering wife; he as the epitome of the English gentleman. Between them they acted in more than 100 productions in London's West End, including 28 in which they both had roles, among them ''The Fourposter,'' Shaw's ''Heartbreak House'' and Christopher Fry's ''Venus Observed.'' As a couple, they also appeared in five films. Without her husband, Ms. Gray had a prominent role in the 1945 movie ''They Were Sisters,'' in which James Mason played a brooding, Svengali-like husband who sadistically destroys his mousy wife's spirit and health. ''Dulcie Gray gives a sensitive portrayal of the ill-fated, fear-stricken wife,'' A. H. Weiler wrote in The New York Times. It was only after 57 years of marriage that Ms. Gray and Mr. Denison first appeared together on Broadway, in the 1996 revival of Oscar Wilde's ''Ideal Husband,'' a scathing comedy about a young politician whose marriage and career are jeopardized when a blackmailer threatens to expose his youthful act of insider trading. Among the dowagers, dukes and dandies who gossiped about the scandal were Ms. Gray as the flighty Lady Markby and Mr. Denison as the humorously dour Earl of Caversham. In his Times review, Vincent Canby wrote, ''It's good to see Mr. Denison and Ms. Gray, who are husband and wife and icons of the English cinema of the 1950s, so full of zest in the 1990s.'' Wife and husband were made Commanders of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth in 1983. Dulcie Bailey was born on Nov. 20, 1915, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Arnold and Kate Bailey (she later took her mother's maiden name, Gray, as her surname). Her father was a judge there. Sent to boarding school in England as a small child, Dulcie returned to Malaysia at 14. But two years later she ran away from home, made her way back to England on a cargo ship and began working as a governess. Eventually she was admitted to the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, where in 1938 she met Mr. Denison. Six months later they were married and working in repertory in Scotland. The couple had no children. During World War II, while Mr. Denison was serving as a military intelligence officer, Ms. Gray began acting in radio soap operas, including 395 performances of ''Front Line Family,'' about a British family living through the blitz, wartime rationing and the loss of relatives in combat. Later in life Ms. Gray enjoyed success in television soap operas, including the long-running yachting series ''Howard's Way.'' Acting was not her only forte. She also wrote several crime novels, a children's book and, in 1978, ''Butterflies on My Mind: The Conservation of British Butterflies'' -- fulfilling a lifetime passion. ''I'm a fellow of the Linnean Society,'' she said, referring to a two-century-old organization devoted to natural history. ''I signed the same book Darwin signed.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

He was 72. His death was announced by Dave Clark, the leader and drummer of the band, which was part of the British Invasion that included the Beatles. Mr. Huxley had emphysema. Mr. Huxley was born in Dartford, England, on Aug. 5, 1940. He was the bassist in the Dave Clark Five for the band's entire existence, from 1958 to 1970. The group, whose members joined forces as teenagers in North London, had a string of hits in the United States and Britain in the 1960s, including ''Bits and Pieces,'' ''Glad All Over'' and ''Catch Us if You Can.'' They made several appearances on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and starred in a feature film, ''Having a Wild Weekend.'' The Dave Clark Five were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. Mr. Clark and the guitarist Lenny Davidson are the surviving members. Denis Payton, who played saxophone, harmonica and guitar, died in 2006.

54566,"Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Photographer, Dies at 100","Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Mexico's greatest photographer and a world master of his art, died on Saturday at his home in Mexico City.","Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Mexico's greatest photographer and a world master of his art, died on Saturday at his home in Mexico City. He was 100. Along with the painters Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco and other Mexican cultural icons, Mr. Alvarez Bravo was a leader of the artistic renaissance that flowered after the Revolution of 1910-21. He was also a friend and peer of foreign avant-garde photographers like Edward Weston, Tina Modotti and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Mr. Alvarez Bravo's photography combined an eager acceptance of artistic influences from abroad with a profoundly Mexican subject matter. Andre Breton, the leader of Surrealism in France, claimed the Mexican photographer as an exponent of his movement. In fact, one of Mr. Alvarez Bravo's best-known works, ""The Good Reputation Sleeping"" (1939) -- a photograph of a naked young woman bizarrely swathed in bandages and asleep on a sidewalk with sprigs of cactus strewn about her -- was produced at Breton's request for a Surrealist exhibition in Mexico City. But Rivera, the muralist and cultural nationalist, could insist with equal vehemence that Mr. Alvarez Bravo's work was ""Mexican by cause, form and content."" His images of shop signs, cafes and street vendors convey the spirit of Mexico's urban life. His landscapes of agave plants, cornfields, arid valleys and haunting mountains evoke the varied Mexican countryside. And his work often exposes the eternal link between Mexico's past and present. In ""Kiln Two"" (1957), for example, brick-making ovens shaped like burning pyramids juxtapose an industrializing country and its shattered Indian heritage. Manuel Alvarez Bravo was born in Mexico City on Feb. 4, 1902 -- ""behind the cathedral, in the place where the temples of ancient Mexican gods must have been built,"" he once said -- and he grew up in the midst of revolutionary violence that claimed a million lives. As an adolescent, he often stumbled across abandoned corpses, victims of civil war gun battles or famine and disease. ""The concept of death is explicit or implicit in my photographs,"" Mr. Alvarez Bravo said. It is perhaps most famously evident in his ""Striking Worker Murdered"" (1934). This photo of a demonstrator moments after he was fatally shot, the glint in his eye suggesting the duality of life and death, displays a fascination with the macabre that informs much of Mexican popular culture and high art. Although his father was a high school teacher, Mr. Alvarez Bravo abandoned formal education when he was 13 and took a job as an office boy. He learned the rudiments of photography from a family friend who gave him a camera bought at a pawnshop. But he continued to support himself until he was in his 20's by working as a government clerk. When he was only 21, he met Hugo Brehme, the noted German photographer, who had come to Mexico on assignment and stayed. Brehme taught Mr. Alvarez Bravo advanced European photographic techniques and introduced him to another German-born photographer resident in Mexico, Wilhelm Kahlo. His daughter, Frida Kahlo, the famed painter and wife of Diego Rivera, became a friend of Mr. Alvarez Bravo and sat for one of his finest portraits. Brehme and Wilhelm Kahlo were the first of a number of talented foreign photographers who helped advance Mr. Alvarez Bravo's career. In the 1920's he met Tina Modotti, an Italian-born photographer, and her American lover, Edward Weston, also a recognized master of the medium. Modotti, who had strong ties to the Mexican muralists, helped Mr. Alvarez Bravo publish his first professional work in Mexican Folkways, a magazine that focused on murals of leading artists as well as popular arts and customs. When Modotti, a Communist, was deported from Mexico in 1930 for her political activities, Mr. Alvarez Bravo inherited her camera and her assignments for Mexican Folkways. At that time, Mexican artists emerged as the vanguard and political conscience of a revolution whose radicalism was already waning. Such muralists as Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros strove to depict the socialist country that they hoped Mexico would eventually become. Rivera said, ""The painter who does not feel attuned to the aspirations of the masses -- this man may not produce a work of art."" Mr. Alvarez Bravo shared that ideology. Before the 16th-century Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, he wrote, ""all art was of the people, and popular art has never ceased to exist in Mexico."" His subjects became workers and peasants and Indian life in the provinces. But Mr. Alvarez Bravo almost always managed to portray them in unconventional ways and through compelling images. For example, ""The Crouched Ones"" (1934) at first seems to be just a photograph of workers leaning over the counter of a bar, their backs to the camera. But the partly closed metal shutter of the cafe casts a black shadow over their heads so that they look decapitated. And chains locking their stools to the bar seem to entwine around the men's feet, adding to the ghastly impression of a mass execution. In another photograph of the same period, ""Public Thirst"" (1933), a young boy crouching on a ledge to drink from an outdoor water fountain conjures up the image of the poor making a first attempt to slake their political thirst. ""Barber"" (1924) shows an old, heavyset man, his back turned to the camera, hunching over a seated youth. Only the title of the photograph reassures the viewer that the ongoing activity is simply a haircut or a shave. The period from the 1920's to the 40's was generally recognized as the apex of Mr. Alvarez Bravo's career, perhaps because those years coincided with the high points of other artists who flourished during Mexico's post-revolutionary cultural renaissance. Mr. Alvarez Bravo continued to be as prolific as ever, but for a long time he received little public recognition, even at home. The photographer Graciela Iturbide recalled that when she signed up for his course at the Center of Cinematographic Studies of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in the late 1960's, he was unknown to her and the rest of the student body. ""Nobody wanted to study with Alvarez Bravo,"" she said, ""because they all wanted to make movies."" In a 1992 interview with The Los Angeles Times, she described Mr. Alvarez Bravo's method. ""We would go out to the countryside to take photographs,"" Ms. Iturbide said. ""Many times he would pick a landscape, set up and wait for something to happen. It was just him thinking and his camera there, waiting. What impressed me, what I most remember, is that he had time for everything. He was not in a hurry."" Unlike most professional photographers, Mr. Alvarez Bravo would shoot only a few frames. ""He didn't take many,"" Ms. Iturbide said. ""Only what he wanted. He didn't repeat four negatives of the same thing."" During the last 40 years of his life, certain earlier tendencies in his photography became more marked. Whether urban or rural, the Mexico that emerged in his pictures seemed increasingly silent, slower and depopulated. Courtyards and streets were empty, or nearly so. Landscapes lay fallow, or perhaps too arid to plant. People were sometimes visible only by their feet or hands, or their presence was simply implied by their handicrafts or meager possessions, like flapping laundry. Late in his life, when it became hard for Mr. Alvarez Bravo to travel outside Mexico City, friends and admirers would bring him objects -- a burnt-out fireworks wheel, a shattered pinata -- to photograph in the courtyard of his studio. He also spent much time photographing nudes. It wasn't the sort of work one could complain about, he joked. ""But the countryside,"" he said, ""the daily life of the street is so much richer than doing portraits, than doing nudes."" Mr. Alvarez Bravo was married three times. His first wife and childhood sweetheart was Lola Alvarez Bravo, who became a noted photographer herself, enjoying a long and varied career in which she worked as a photojournalist, taught photography and art, organized exhibitions and wrote a Surrealist screenplay with Frida Kahlo. His second wife was Doris Heyden. Mr. Alvarez Bravo lived with his third wife, Colette Urbajtel, also a photographer, just across from his studio on a narrow, winding street of Coyoacan, a southern district of the capital. Besides his wife, Mr. Alvarez Bravo is survived by five children: Manuel, Laurencia, Miguel, Aurelia and Genoveva. In recent years, he finally achieved the recognition abroad that had eluded him. There were major exhibitions, including the recent one by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles to honor him on turning 100. That exhibition, ""Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Optical Parables,"" included more than 100 of his photographs, spanning eight decades. Weston Naef, the Getty's curator of photographs, pointed out that Mr. Alvarez Bravo defied the convention of the globe-trotting photographer who travels widely to find his images. ""For Alvarez Bravo,"" Mr. Naef said, ""almost all of his greatest pictures were made within 100 miles of his home."" He was, Mr. Naef said, ""completely committed to a body of work that had its grounding in the soil from which he came."" Perhaps the most succinct and memorable interpretation of Mr. Alvarez Bravo's work came in a poem that Octavio Paz, the Mexican Nobel laureate, dedicated to the photographer. It reads in part: The eye thinks, the thought sees, the sight touches, the"
20078,"Clive Donner, 84, 1960s-Era Film Director","Clive Donner, who helped define the British New Wave with films like ''The Caretaker'' and ''Nothing but the Best'' and directed the emblematic swinging '60s film ''What's New Pussycat?,'' died on Tuesday in London.","Clive Donner, who helped define the British New Wave with films like ''The Caretaker'' and ''Nothing but the Best'' and directed the emblematic swinging '60s film ''What's New Pussycat?,'' died on Tuesday in London. He was 84. His death was confirmed by Gavin Asher, a cousin, who told Reuters that Mr. Donner had had Alzheimer's for several years. Mr. Donner broke through as a director in 1963 with a low-budget black-and-white film of Harold Pinter's play ''The Caretaker,'' with Alan Bates, Donald Pleasence and Robert Shaw. Since he couldn't find traditional backing for the film, a group of well-wishers that included Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Peter Sellers and Noel Coward financed it. The actors waived their salaries, accepting a share of future profits instead. Superbly acted, with a distinctive look created by the cinematographer Nicolas Roeg, ''The Caretaker'' established Mr. Donner as a filmmaker to watch. He delivered on this promise with ''Nothing but the Best'' (1964), a tart satire with a screenplay by Frederic Raphael. It told the story of an ambitious clerk, played by Mr. Bates, who sets out to scale the class ladder with a little tutoring from an upper-crust scapegrace played by Denholm Elliott. The cinematographer again was Mr. Roeg, working in color this time. Mr. Donner struck box-office gold with his first Hollywood film, ''What's New Pussycat?'' (1965), a naughty slapstick comedy with Peter O'Toole and Sellers thrown among a throng of beauties, among them Capucine, Paula Prentiss, Romy Schneider and Ursula Andress. The script was by Woody Allen, who also appeared in the film but later disavowed it. Audiences, enthralled from the moment Tom Jones began singing the Burt Bacharach-Hal David title song, voted a resounding yes. ''Donner, like Richard Lester, seems to have anticipated the transformation of England from mum to mod,'' Andrew Sarris wrote in ''The American Cinema'' in 1969. ''It remains to be seen if the prophet can avoid being swallowed by his own revolution.'' Mr. Donner delivered a dud with the frantic Jack Lemmon-Peter Falk comedy ''Luv'' (1967), and after the 1960s his career tapered off. His later efforts included the less than memorable ''Nude Bomb'' (1980) -- a spinoff of the television series ''Get Smart'' -- and ''Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen'' (1981), with Peter Ustinov as the Chinese detective. In the 1980s he directed George C. Scott in two Dickens classics remade for television, ''Oliver Twist'' and ''A Christmas Carol.'' Clive Donner, who is unrelated to the American director Richard Donner, was born in London on Jan. 21, 1926. His father was a concert violinist and his mother ran a dress shop. While attending Kilburn Polytechnic he made a short 8-millimeter film, about a boys' sports club, and soon after graduating he found work as a cutting-room assistant at Denham Studios. After military service he returned to Denham and within a few years was hired as a full-fledged editor at Pinewood Studios, where he worked on ''Scrooge,'' ''The Card,'' ''The Million Pound Note,'' ''I Am a Camera'' and other films. He directed several low-budget films at Pinewood, including ''The Secret Place'' (1957), a caper film with David McCallum playing a troubled delinquent, and ''Heart of a Child'' (1958), a three-handkerchief boy-and-his-dog film. He also directed episodes of the British television series ''Danger Man'' and ''Sir Francis Drake'' and a documentary series about India, ''Mighty and Mystical,'' for Granada Television. A hint of things to come could be seen in ''Some People'' (1962). Shot on location in Bristol, England, it tells the story of disaffected teenagers who form a rock group. It captured the pent-up energy of British youth culture, anticipating shock waves just over the horizon. After ''Luv,'' Mr. Donner returned to Britain with a coming-of-age film, ''Here We Go 'Round the Mulberry Bush'' (1968), about a teenage boy's sexual fantasies, and ''Alfred the Great'' (1969), a sweeping, big-budget historical drama that pitted David Hemmings, as Alfred, against a savage Viking chieftain, played by Michael York. Critics judged the film to be as bad as it sounds. Although ''Alfred'' nearly ended Mr. Donner's career as a director of feature films, it did yield a dividend. Mr. Donner married its costume designer, Jocelyn Rickards, who died in 2005. He leaves no immediate survivors. Unable to find work directing films, Mr. Donner made television commercials and directed plays. ''Kennedy's Children,'' which opened in a pub theater in Islington, London, in 1974, became a hit that transferred to the West End and Broadway. That same year he directed the film ''Vampira,'' with David Niven as a somewhat decrepit Count Dracula. (It was released in the United States as ''Old Dracula.'') More successfully, he directed the television film ''Rogue Male'' (1976), a taut thriller about a British aristocrat, played by Mr. O'Toole, who tries to assassinate Hitler and flees to Dorset, pursued by Gestapo agents. It delighted the critics -- The Daily Telegraph of London called it ''a super glossy which would have done credit to Pinewood or Ealing in their heyday'' -- and remained one of Mr. Donner's favorite films."

Choate Jr., who gave up an engineering career to devote himself to fighting against poverty and malnutrition, seizing national attention in 1970 by telling a Senate subcommittee that most breakfast cereals barely qualify to be called food, died on May 3 in Lemon Grove, Calif.","Robert B. Choate Jr., who gave up an engineering career to devote himself to fighting against poverty and malnutrition, seizing national attention in 1970 by telling a Senate subcommittee that most breakfast cereals barely qualify to be called food, died on May 3 in Lemon Grove, Calif. He was 84. Mr. Choate's son Valerian said he died as the result of a medical condition that prevented him from swallowing. Mr. Choate, superficially a tweedy, bow-tied Boston Brahmin, decided in midlife that he wanted to rankle feathers. An early step was publishing a magazine in Phoenix, where he moved in the late 1950s, that deliberately irritated the city's conservative establishment. Soon he was at the center of a roiling national discussion of how to best use America's agricultural bounty to nourish its people. ''He was one of a half-dozen people who brought health and malnutrition to the eyes of the public,'' Nick Kotz, author of ''Let Them Eat Promises: The Politics of Hunger'' (1969), said in an interview. In hearings before a Senate subcommittee on consumers in July 1970, Mr. Choate, a self-described ''citizen lobbyist,'' testified that 40 of the 60 leading breakfast cereals were so low in nutritional content that they constituted ''empty calories.'' He displayed a detailed chart of the nutritional components of the 60 cereals to argue that many cereals were no healthier than candy bars or gin. A public firestorm erupted. ''Snap, Crackle, Flop,'' a Newsweek magazine headline said. Time magazine asked, ''Breakfast of Chumps?'' The cereal industry counterattacked, saying that Mr. Choate had failed to factor in the nutritional value of milk poured on the cereal. He promptly drafted a new chart, milk included. The companies contended that lots of sugar was needed to entice children to eat. Mr. Choate countered that a taste for sugar is acquired. The companies were quick to point out that Mr. Choate was an engineer, not a nutritionist. An unidentified Kellogg's spokesman said in an interview with The Christian Science Monitor: ''We feel Mr. Choate is a very talented individual, particularly if he's digging ditches or building bridges.'' Mr. Choate said his role was to be a catalyst, not a scientist. He told The Monitor that he was someone who ''plays the citizen role in a rather more blatant fashion than most.'' In fact, within two years of Mr. Choate's initial blast, the companies had significantly increased the nutritional content of many cereals, but the best-sellers continued to be those at the bottom of Mr. Choate's nutritional-value list. Federal authorities began requiring some nutritional labeling in 1974 and mandated it for most foods two decades later. Robert Burnett Choate Jr. was born in Boston on Nov. 6, 1924. He came from a family of senators, ambassadors and other public men. His father was publisher of The Boston Herald. Young Robert was influenced by a grandmother who worked in settlement houses. Mr. Choate graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy in 1943 and attended Harvard under a Navy officer-training program. He then served in the Pacific during World War II before earning an engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley. Afterward he worked as an engineer. The turning point in his life came while he was recuperating from a bout of hepatitis. Reading extensively about racial and social matters, he decided to devote his life to social causes, effectively giving up an engineering career. He said in an interview with The New York Times in 1966 that he decided to ''wake up the hidebound establishments of this state.'' His initiatives included feeding the hungry, youth training, a failed try at supplanting California orange juice with Arizona's own and a caustic short-lived magazine, Reveille. The magazine's subjects were as varied as the ''dubious value'' of some of the art in the Phoenix Art Museum and accusations of complacency on the part of the city's black leadership. Financing his activities through a foundation he set up, Mr. Choate grew eager for a larger stage. In 1965, he put together a conference in Phoenix on poverty in the Southwest. Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and R. Sargent Shriver, then the director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, attended. Mr. Choate arrived in Washington in 1966, and he and his wife at the time, Laura Jean Emery, knowing virtually no one in town, visited the offices of all 535 members of Congress in just a few days to discuss hunger and malnutrition, Mr. Kotz said. Mr. Choate worked as a consultant for the Nixon administration on nutrition issues and helped set up a White House conference on food and hunger issues in 1969. Mr. Choate is survived by his daughter Karen Holland, from his first marriage, to Audrey Evans. From his second marriage, to Ms. Emery, he is survived by his sons Christopher and Valerian, and his daughter Katrinka Johnson. He is also survived by three grandchildren. In 1970, Mr. Choate founded the Council on Children, Media and Merchandising to call attention to commercials intended for children, which he characterized as a tug of war between 200-pound men and 60-pound youngsters. Where others might use the verb ''advertised,'' he deemed ''huckstered'' more appropriate."
55301,"DR. GLYNN ISSAC, ANTHROPOLOGIST","Glynn Llywelyn Isaac, a professor of anthropology at Harvard University who was known for his study of human origins and his archeological work in East Africa, died of unknown causes, the university said today.","CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 7 Glynn Llywelyn Isaac, a professor of anthropology at Harvard University who was known for his study of human origins and his archeological work in East Africa, died of unknown causes, the university said today. He was 47 years old. Mr. Isaac became ill on a trip to Peking for the National Academy of Sciences and was taken to the United States Naval Hospital in Tokyo. He was to return to the United States for treatment when he collapsed and died at the American air base in Tokyo Sunday, the university said. Dr. Isaac joined the Harvard faculty in 1983 as an anthropology professor with the Peabody Museum after spending 17 years of teaching and research at the University of California at Berkeley. He spent his first professional years in the early 1960's in Africa as warden of prehistoric sites in Kenya and deputy director to Louis Leakey at the Center for Prehistory and Paleontology in Nairobi. Ancient Sites Explored He was co-leader with Richard Leakey of the National Museum of Kenya when, at Koobi Fora, he and his team were responsible for the excavation of nearly 20 archeological sites, some as much as 2 million years old. More recently, Dr. Isaac, who was born in Cape Town in 1937, had become interested in the role that changing diet may have played in human evolution. ''Just looking at the list of invited lectures that he did over the last few years: the Royal Society of London in 1980, the Darwin Centenary Conference in Cambridge in 1982 and many others shows that he was the spokesman for the field of paleoanthropology,'' said his longtime friend and colleague, David Pilbeam, who also teaches anthropology at Harvard. ''He was an active field archeologist, at the cutting edge of paleoanthropology, a dedicated teacher and an internationally recognized scholar,'' said Stanley J. Tambiah, chairman of Harvard's anthropology department. Dr. Isaac received his bachelor's degree at the University of Cape Town in 1958, and his doctorate from the University of Cambridge in 1961. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and two daughters, Gwyneira and Ceri. A memorial service is being planned by his colleagues."

Mr. Mottola is survived by his wife of 62 years, Grace, who is known as Mitzi; a son; three daughters; seven grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren."
9010,"Fritz Stern, 90, Noted Historian on Germany, Dies","Fritz Stern, a German-born historian and longtime professor at Columbia University whose searching studies of Germany's political culture in the 19th and 20th centuries provided a new understanding of the drift toward totalitarianism, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan.","Fritz Stern, a German-born historian and longtime professor at Columbia University whose searching studies of Germany's political culture in the 19th and 20th centuries provided a new understanding of the drift toward totalitarianism, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90. The death was confirmed by his wife, Elisabeth Sifton, the former senior vice president of the publishing company Farrar, Straus & Giroux. Like many German historians of his generation, Professor Stern sought to explain the causes behind the events that upended his own life and that of his family, Jews who lived a prosperous, assimilated life in Breslau until oppressive conditions forced them to emigrate to the United States in 1938. ''Though I lived in National Socialist Germany for only five years, that brief period saddled me with the burning question that I have spent my professional life trying to answer: Why and how did the universal potential for evil become an actuality in Germany?'' he wrote in the introduction to ''Five Germanys I Have Known,'' a blend of memoir and history published in 2006. In his first book, ''The Politics of Cultural Despair: A Study in the Rise of the Germanic Ideology,'' published in 1961, Dr. Stern shed light on the intellectual climate that made Germany receptive to Nazi ideology. He took an unusual tack, studying lesser-known figures -- the cultural critic Julius Langbehn, the biblical scholar Paul de Lagarde and the man of letters Arthur Moeller van den Bruck -- whose mystical nationalism and hostility to Western liberal values represented broader intellectual trends. ''I attempted to show the importance of this new type of cultural malcontent, and to show how he facilitated the intrusion into politics of essentially unpolitical grievances,'' Dr. Stern wrote in a preface to the book's second edition. He was particularly interested in the role that the political and cultural elites -- the ostensible gatekeepers and guardians of civilized values -- played in smoothing the way for Hitler's rise, and in the German resistance to liberal modes of thought. He pursued these avenues of inquiry in the essays collected in ''The Failure of Illiberalism: Essays on the Political Culture of Modern Germany'' (1972) and ''Dreams and Delusions: The Drama of German History'' (1987). Fritz Richard Stern was born on Feb. 2, 1926, in Breslau. His father, Rudolf, was a physician, like nearly all his male relatives. His mother, the former Kthe Brieger, held a doctorate in physics. Both families had converted to Lutheranism. Dr. Stern, falling into line with family tradition, entered Columbia as a pre-med student, but classes with Jacques Barzun and Lionel Trilling stoked his enthusiasm for the humanities. Torn, he approached Albert Einstein, a family friend, for counsel. Should he pursue the study of history or medicine? ''That's simple: Medicine is a science, and history is not,'' he recalled Einstein replying. ''Hence medicine.'' Ignoring the advice, Professor Stern pursued history, earning a bachelor's degree in 1946, a master's degree in 1948 and a doctorate in 1953. After teaching at Cornell in the early 1950s. he spent his career at Columbia. After beginning as a lecturer in 1946, he became a full professor in 1963. He was named Seth Low professor of history in 1967 and university professor in 1992. From 1980 to 1983, he served as the university's provost. He retired at the end of 1996. His first marriage, in 1947, to Margaret Bassett, ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Sifton, he is survived by two children from his first marriage, a son, Frederick, and a daughter, Katherine Brennan; three stepsons, Sam, Toby and John Sifton; three grandchildren; four step-grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. (Sam Sifton is the food editor of The New York Times.) Dr. Stern's older sister, Toni Stern Gould, who had emigrated with the family, died in 2013. Dr. Stern ranged widely over modern German history, identifying themes and intellectual currents running from the founding of the German state in 1871 to the present. In ''Gold and Iron: Bismarck, Bleichrder and the Building of the German Empire'' (1977), he focused on Gerson Bleichrder, a Prussian Jew who, as Bismarck's financial agent and adviser, played a decisive role in the unification of Germany and the Franco-Prussian War. Immensely wealthy and powerful, yet despised as a Jew, he was an emblematic figure. In its review of the book, The Economist wrote of Dr. Stern that ''his style, his understanding of human character, his reconstructions of historical events and his setting of them in their larger context are all characterized by a lucidity, a judiciousness and a depth of learning which all scholars will envy.'' Dr. Stern's fascination with Germany's scientific culture in the early 20th century inspired a work of historical reconstruction, ''Einstein's German World'' (1999). The moral quandaries of the Nazi period preoccupied him to the end of his life, and found expression in the 2013 work ''No Ordinary Men: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Hans von Dohnanyi: Resisters Against Hitler in Church and State,'' which he wrote with Ms. Sifton. Dr. Stern's scholarly preoccupations dovetailed with his public role as an interpreter of the German past, defender of liberal values and passionate advocate for a united, peaceful Europe. He was a senior adviser to the American Embassy in Bonn in 1992, and he often lectured on political issues in Germany, where he was regarded as the pre-eminent American historian of modern Germany. In its obituary, the newspaper Die Welt called him ''a guardian angel of the new Germany.'' ''I was born into a world on the cusp of avoidable disaster,'' he wrote in ''Five Germanys.'' He added, ''The fragility of freedom is the simplest and deepest lesson of my life and work.''"

He was 71. The Jerusalem Post said that Mr. Dan died after a battle with lung cancer, adding that he had continued working until last month. Mr. Dan died at a hospital in Kfar Sava, outside Tel Aviv, the paper said. During a career spanning more than three decades, Mr. Dan wrote for a number of Israeli publications, including Maariv and The Jerusalem Post. He also wrote several books and served as the Israel correspondent for The New York Post. But Mr. Dan was best-known for his friendship with Mr. Sharon. The two became acquainted in the 1950s, and Mr. Dan documented Mr. Sharon's crossing of the Suez Canal during the 1973 war against Egypt. He also served as Mr. Sharon's spokesman when he was defense minister during the war in Lebanon in the 1980s. At the time, Mr. Sharon was under fire for his actions in the war and earlier had been passed over as a candidate for army chief. ''Those who didn't want to see him as army chief shall have him as defense minister, and those who didn't want him as defense minister shall have him as prime minister,'' Mr. Dan presciently said. Despite Mr. Dan's misgivings about Mr. Sharon's pullout from the Gaza Strip last year, the two remained friends until Mr. Sharon's debilitating stroke last January. Just two months ago, Mr. Dan published the biography ''Ariel Sharon: An Intimate Portrait.'' ''He was an old-style journalist in that he never took on to Internet and wrote by hand, and he relied on his personal experience and reporting instincts even in his opinion pieces,'' said Saul Singer, a Jerusalem Post columnist and editorial page editor."
19325,"Jozef Paczynski, 95, Dies; Spent 5 Years as Auschwitz Inmate","Jozef Paczynski, a Polish Army captain who spent much of his five-year imprisonment in Auschwitz as the personal barber to Rudolf Hss, the Nazi death camp's commandant, died on Sunday in Krakow.","Jozef Paczynski, a Polish Army captain who spent much of his five-year imprisonment in Auschwitz as the personal barber to Rudolf Hss, the Nazi death camp's commandant, died on Sunday in Krakow. He was 95. His death was announced by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum. Mr. Paczynski was 20 when he was captured crossing into Slovakia trying to flee German-occupied Poland to join Polish freedom fighters in France. He was among the first 700 young prisoners transported to Auschwitz in June 1940, assigned No. 121. He would remain at the camp in Poland until Jan. 18, 1945, when the Germans moved him just days before the Soviet Army arrived, making him one of Auschwitz's longest surviving inmates. He was later freed by American troops. Mr. Paczynski owed his survival, in part, to getting an indoor assignment as an apprentice barber in a shop where SS officers had their hair cut. After Hss's regular barber, a convicted criminal, was arrested for stealing perfume, Mr. Paczynski -- identified by Hss as the ''kleine Pole,'' the small Pole -- was accompanied to the commandant's villa, where Hss' wife escorted him to an upstairs bathroom. ''I work with 10 Warsaw hairstylists, fantastic professionals, and it is me who is to give Hss a haircut? How? Good God! I was terrified!'' Mr. Paczynski told The Irreversible, an oral history project. ''I shaved his hair over his ears with a razor and trimmed the rest with a shaving machine. My hands trembled terribly. We never exchanged a single word. I was afraid and he was disgusted. And so almost every week for over four years I would go give Rudolf Hss a haircut. And he never spoke to me. Never!'' Mr. Paczynski elaborated in ''Auschwitz: A New History'' (2005) by Laurence Rees, recalling that Hss was smoking a cigar and reading a newspaper. ''I did the same haircut I had seen done on him before,'' Mr. Paczynski said. ''It wasn't a great piece of art.'' He was often asked why, with motive and opportunity, he did not slit Hss' throat. ''I had a razor in my hand,'' he said. ''I could have cut his throat -- it could have happened. But I'm a thinking being, and you know what would have happened? My whole family would have been destroyed; half of the camp would be destroyed. In his place someone else would have come.'' Hss, who installed gas chambers and crematories and had converted Auschwitz into a death camp, was sentenced to death and hanged in 1947. Mr. Paczynski, who witnessed mass exterminations at Auschwitz, testified at war-crimes trials that led to the convictions of SS guards for crimes against humanity. Information on survivors was not available. In later years he was an engineering teacher. In 2001 he was honored with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Rebirth of Poland."

He was 52 and lived in Riverdale in the Bronx. The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Meira Shaham. Neutron stars are extremely dense objects, often with the mass of the sun packed into a diameter of several miles. They are thought to be born in the collapse of normal stars in supernova explosions. The resulting spinning neutron stars emit periodic radio waves and are known as pulsars. It is through the detection of pulsars that the neutron stars reveal themselves. Professor Shaham and his associates at Columbia found that neutron stars sometimes increased their rates of spin after picking up mass from companion stars. They proposed the mechanism by which this takes place, and predicted that such pulsars would eventually evaporate their companion stars. Professor Shaham was born in Tel Aviv and educated at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where he received a Ph.D. in 1971. He did research there and at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana before joining Columbia in 1984. He was appointed deputy chairman of the physics department and co-director of the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory last year. Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Orli, of Manhattan, and two sons, Shai, of Boston, and Gil, of Manhattan."

Weakland, an innovative psychotherapist who helped originate the field of family therapy and created elegantly simple strategies for solving problems of human behavior at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif., died on July 8 at his home in Palo Alto.","John F. Weakland, an innovative psychotherapist who helped originate the field of family therapy and created elegantly simple strategies for solving problems of human behavior at the Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif., died on July 8 at his home in Palo Alto. He was 76. His wife, Anna Wu, said the cause was Lou Gehrig's disease. In his work at the institute, Mr. Weakland helped conceive and develop many of the avant-garde approaches and therapies that have kept the institute on the cutting edge, even as the earlier concepts have become standards in modern therapy. The institute therapists, who savor their reputation for repudiating virtually every concept and practice of traditional psychotherapy, maintain that alcoholism is not a disease but merely a label for the problem of excessive drinking. And whether treating excessive drinking or other problems, the therapists apply a philosophy that could be summed up as ""keep it simple."" Following prescriptions laid down by Mr. Weakland and others, they ignore the presumed deep-seated, childhood-rooted, underlying causes of human problems and deal directly with the problems. Mr. Weakland, a native of Charleston, W.Va., was a brilliant student with a restless mind. He entered Cornell University at the age of 16 and later spent six years as a promising chemical engineer with the Du Pont Company before a chance encounter with the anthropologist Gregory Bateson led him to switch to that field. Although he studied anthropology under Mr. Bateson at the New School in New York and with Mr. Bateson's wife, Margaret Mead, at Columbia University, Mr. Weakland never obtained his doctorate. Rejecting his adviser's criticisms of his thesis, he refused to revise it. Mr. Weakland followed Mr. Bateson's lead in moving from anthropology to the study of schizophrenia and alcoholism at the University of California at Berkeley and at the veterans hospitalin Palo Alto. Mr. Weakland used his experiences studying contemporary cultures like Navaho and Chinese societies in developing techniques for observing and understanding family problems. For example, he was a pioneer in the use of films, audio recordings and one-way mirrors to study the interactions of family members. Mr. Weakland was an original member of the institute, which was founded in 1959. He wrote or helped write more than 60 scholarly papers and six books, and also maintained a private practice and served as an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at Stanford University. Although the institute claims a success rate as high as 65 percent for the streamlined, 10-session program Mr. Wealkand helped create for its Brief Therapy Center, he stressed that the therapy was no panacea. ""When you have a problem,"" he liked to say, ""life is the same damn thing over and over. When you no longer have a problem, life is one damn thing after another."" In addition to his wife, an artist, he is survived by two sons, Alan of San Marino, Calif., and Lewis of Los Angeles; a daughter, Joan, of Williamsburg, Va., and two grandchildren."
58788,"Paul Coverdell, 61, Dies; Influential Senator From Georgia","Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia, a soft-spoken but influential Republican leader, died tonight in Atlanta from a massive cerebral hemorrhage he suffered over the weekend.","WASHINGTON, July 18 Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia, a soft-spoken but influential Republican leader, died tonight in Atlanta from a massive cerebral hemorrhage he suffered over the weekend. He was 61. Mr. Coverdell had undergone surgery on Monday in Atlanta, his hometown, after being hospitalized for severe headaches. Rising rapidly, if almost invisibly, in the inner circles of Senate power, Mr. Coverdell emerged as a close confidant of Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, the majority leader. Mr. Lott often turned to Mr. Coverdell, a self-effacing former insurance executive, to handle some of the most difficult and politically unrewarding jobs. An ally and longtime friend of former President George Bush, Mr. Coverdell was the chief liaison in the Senate to the presidential campaign of Mr. Bush's son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ""Paul's soft-spoken, hard-working ways will be sorely missed by all of us who knew him and loved him,"" Governor Bush said in a statement released through his campaign office. On the Senate floor tonight, Mr. Lott choked back tears in praising his former colleague. ""Paul has been a close friend and confidant, and an outstanding member of this body,"" Mr. Lott said. In a statement tonight, President Clinton praised Mr. Coverdell's contributions to the Senate and the country. ""He was a tireless advocate who worked to ensure that all children have access to quality education,"" Mr. Clinton said. Mr. Coverdell's death, which follows the death last year of another sitting Republican Senator, John Chafee of Rhode Island, opens a Republican seat at time when the party holds a 55-to-45 margin. Mr. Coverdell won re-election in 1998 for a second six-year term. Under Georgia law, the state's Democratic governor, Roy Barnes, will appoint an interim replacement until a special election can be held. The state's Democratic senator, Max Cleland, said the two possible candidates for the interim position would be Michael Coles, the Democratic cookie magnate who lost to Mr. Coverdell in the 1998 election, and a former Democratic representative, Buddy Darden. Mr. Barnes seemed unlikely to offer himself for the Senate since he was elected only two years ago. Mr. Cleland, who was sworn into the Georgia State Senate on the same day with Mr. Coverdell 30 years, expressed his respect for his former colleague. ""He never showed a trace of personal ego or animosity,"" Mr. Cleland said. ""He loved public service, he loved politics and he loved to contribute."" As the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate, Mr. Coverdell held the title of secretary of the conference. But he was expected to move up the ladder to conference chairmanship with the retirement this fall of Senator Connie Mack of Florida. As secretary, Mr. Coverdell essentially ran the marketing department for Senate Republicans, putting his organizational prowess to work in shaping the party's message in five areas: education, taxes, Social Security, defense and drug prevention. In the Senate, Mr. Coverdell's interests and expertise ranged broadly. He championed education savings accounts, a signature Republican issue. He was a chief backer of a $1.3 billion aid package to help Colombia combat drug traffickers protected by rebel insurgents in the South American nation. Senator Coverdell was first elected to the Senate in 1992, squeaking out a victory over the liberal Democratic incumbent, Wyche Fowler Jr. He won again in 1998, despite concerns about his political vulnerability, much of it fueled by his low-key, behind-the-scenes style of getting things done. And in a chamber bulging with oversized egos, Mr. Coverdell relished his image as an quiet insider. ""He was a humble man who brought to the public discourse good ideas and common-sense solutions,"" Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said in a statement. ""He didn't care who received the credit."" In the Senate, Senator Coverdell was considered a rarity: A man who took on difficult tasks, got things done and eschewed both the limelight and the credit. Mr. Lott affectionately called him ""Mikey,"" for the boy in the Life cereal commercial who would ""eat anything."" Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Lott has said, would do anything that was asked of him, and do it with enthusiasm. In fact, outside of work, he had few other interests or hobbies. On the Senate floor, Mr. Coverdell was not a particularly eloquent speaker and reporters sometimes struggled to find a single straight-forward quote of his they could put in the newspaper. But his timid demeanor belied his commitment to Republican politics and his partisan drive. A conservative on most issues, Mr. Coverdell did not hesitate to fight for tax cuts and a smaller federal government, two favorite Republican themes. Senator Coverdell served in the Georgia State Senate from 1970 to 1989, where he acted as minority leader for 14 years. Mr. Coverdell often joked that he knew too well what it was like being an underdog since, as minority leader in the Senate, he represented all of 5 Republicans, as opposed to 51 Democrats. It was during this time that he first met President Bush, who was then United States delegate to the United Nations, and the encounter led to a lifelong friendship. Mr. Coverdell was a frequent visitor to Kennebunkport, Me., Mr. Bush's vacation home, despite his professed incompetence on the links and aboard a fishing boat. ""I'm not a golfer,"" he said during a recent interview. ""And I tangled up his fishing reel."" In a statement today, former President Bush said, ""Paul Coverdell was one of the kindest and most decent men I met in my entire life."" He served as state chairman for the Georgia Republican Party from 1985 to 1987. In 1989, one year after Mr. Bush was elected, Senator Coverdell was rewarded for his loyalty and was named director of the Peace Corps, a position which cemented his interest in foreign affairs. Last year, his loyalty to the Bush family led to his selection as Senate liaison to Governor Bush's campaign. Born in Des Moines on Jan. 29, 1939, Senator Coverdell spent a large part of his childhood in the Midwest. He earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri in 1961, and then joined the Army in 1962, serving in Okinawa, among other places. After leaving the Army, he helped his parents start the family's Atlanta insurance and financial services business, Coverdell & Company. He married Nancy Nally, a former flight attendant. Survivors include his wife. The two had no children. http://www.nytimes.com"
40657,"CHARLES DESMOND, RETIRED CHIEF JUDGE, DIES","Charles Stewart Desmond, who was Chief Judge of New York from 1960 through 1966, died Monday at Mercy Hospital in Buffalo.","Charles Stewart Desmond, who was Chief Judge of New York from 1960 through 1966, died Monday at Mercy Hospital in Buffalo. He was 90 years old and lived on a farm in Eden, N.Y., near Buffalo. In his quarter-century on the bench, Judge Desmond spent all but one year on the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. He bypassed the long apprenticeship of County Court, Supreme Court and Appellate Division served by most of his colleagues. Judge Desmond made the move from his Buffalo law practice to the Court of Appeals almost in a single stride. A lifelong Democrat, he was appointed by Gov. Herbert H. Lehman to a Supreme Court vacancy on Jan. 5, 1940. His political sponsor was Paul E. Fitzpatrick, who was later to become Democratic State chairman. Mr. Fitzpatrick tried to persuade western New York Republicans to endorse the lawyer for a full elective term on the Supreme Court in the fall of 1940. He failed, but succeeded in winning him the Democratic nomination for a vacancy on the Court of Appeals. Praised by Moynihan ''Charles Desmond's life spanned almost half the life of the United States Constitution,'' Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, said yesterday in Washington, where Judge Desmond had served on the Senator's judicial screening panel. ''Few in all that history have done half so much to sustain and enhance a glorious constitutional tradition.'' During his years on the bench, Judge Desmond was generally regarded as a leader of the liberal wing of the court, but his decisions and opinions often defied easy categorization. On occasions he was criticized for his judicial views by some of those of both his political faith - Democratic - and his religious faith - Roman Catholic - criticisms he survived with equanimity. Judge Desmond stepped down from the court at the mandatory retirement age of 70 on Dec. 31, 1966. He returned to private practice and to teaching at the University of New York at Buffalo Law School. He also taught at Cornell Law School and, for a time, conducted a ''summer seminar'' for appellate judges from across the country at New York University. He was a member of the board of International Controls Corporation until last year, when he became a legal consultant to the company. A Deep Interest in Reform He took a deep interest in judicial reform and tried for years to abolish jury trials in civil cases, a move he was confident would unclog court calendars. Some of Judge Desmond's decisions reinforced landmark rulings by the United States Supreme Court. In a 1965 case, he followed the pattern of the Clarence Earl Gideon case, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the government must assign lawyers to all criminal defendants. In a majority opinion, Judge Desmond wrote that criminal defendants in all state courts must be told in plain language that a lawyer will be assigned to them if they cannot afford to hire one. He was also the author of two books, ''Sharp Quillets of the Law'' and ''From the Courthouse Window.'' Judge Desmond was born Dec. 2, 1896, in the room above his father's saloon near the Lake Erie docks in Buffalo. After earning an A.B. and an M.A. at Canisius College, he obtained a law degree at the University of Buffalo in 1920. During World War I Judge Desmond served as a second lieutenant in the marine air arm. However, he caught influenza during training and did not get overseas before the Armistice. A family man, whose children all live in or near Eden, he took particular pride in his son, Charles Ryan Desmond, a Buffalo lawyer who was elected Justice of the Peace in Eden in late 1950's on the Democratic ticket in an area where Republicans predominated five to one. Ryan, as his family called him, was killed in an automobile accident during a blizzard two years ago. Judge Desmond's wife, the former Helen Ryan, died in 1958. He is survived by three daughters, Sheila Landon, Kathleen Hughes and Patricia Williams, all of Eden, and 12 grandchildren."

He spent much of the 1930's in Paris, where he befriended James Joyce and later was a personal secretary to Ezra Pound. He was the author of ""Presentation of James Joyce"" (1981). His last book, the 1991 ""Profile of Clouds,"" was a collection of art criticism over six decades. After the Spanish Civil War, Mr. Masoliver returned to Spain and worked briefly as a propagandist for Franco. He then began writing for a variety of newspapers, primarily Barcelona's Vanguardia, where he worked for more than 60 years."
57624,"Bella Abzug, 77, Congresswoman And a Founding Feminist, Is Dead","Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan.","Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77. She died of complications following heart surgery, said Harold Holzer, who was her spokesman when she served in Congress. She had been hospitalized for weeks, and had been in poor health for several years, he said. Ms. Abzug represented the West Side of Manhattan for three Congressional terms in the 1970's. She brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character. Often called just Bella, she was recognizable everywhere by her big hats and a voice that Norman Mailer said ""could boil the fat off a taxicab driver's neck."" She opposed the Vietnam War, championed what was then called women's liberation and was one of the first to call for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Long after it ceased to be fashionable, she called her politics radical. During her last campaign, for Congress in 1986, she told The New York Times, ""I am not a centrist."" Bella Abzug was a founding feminist, and an enduring one. In the movement's giddy, sloganeering early days, Ms. Abzug was, like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, an icon, the hat bobbing before the cameras at marches and rallies. After leaving the House in January 1977, she worked for women's rights for two more decades. She founded an international women's group that worked on environmental issues. And she was a leader of a conference of nongovernmental organizations that paralleled the United Nations' fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. Even then, she continued to rankle. Former President George Bush, on a private visit to China that coincided with the Beijing conference, said to a meeting of food production executives: ""I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around. Bella Abzug is one who has always represented the extremes of the women's movement."" When told of Mr. Bush's remark, Ms. Abzug, 75 and in a wheelchair, retorted: ""He was addressing a fertilizer group? That's appropriate."" Her forceful personality and direct manner made her a lightning rod for criticism from those who opposed the idea of holding a women's conference. After Bob Dole, then the Senate majority leader, said he could not imagine why anyone ""would want to attend a conference co-chaired by Bella Abzug,"" she responded that she was not running the meeting but simply participating with more than 30,000 other women over how best to achieve equal rights. But much of what Ms. Abzug agitated for -- abortion rights, day care, laws against employment discrimination -- was by that time mainstream political fare. In Congress, ""she was first on almost everything, on everything that ever mattered,"" said Esther Newberg, Ms. Abzug's first administrative assistant and one of many staff members who quit but remained devoted. ""She was first to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, first to call for an end to the war."" Ms. Abzug made enemies easily -- ""Sometimes the hat and the mouth took over,"" Ms. Newberg said -- but Ms. Abzug saw that as a consequence of a refusal to compromise, as well as a matter of sport. Of her time in the House, Ms. Abzug wrote in a journal that was published in 1972 as ""Bella,"" ""I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the crap out of the political power structure."" She worked relentlessly at organizing and coalition-building. A founder of Women Strike for Peace and the National Women's Political Caucus, she spent a lifetime prodding for change, with a lawyer's enthusiasm for political channels, through organizations from the P.T.A. to the United Nations. She made friends easily, too. ""She's fierce and intense and funny,"" said her longtime friend Gloria Steinem. ""She takes everyone seriously. When she argues with you fiercely, it's because she takes you seriously. And she's willing to change her mind. That's so rare."" Her First Speech, In a Subway Station Bella Savitzky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920 in the Bronx, the second daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, whom Ms. Abzug later described as ""this humanist butcher,"" ran (and named) the Live and Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan. She said she knew from the age of 11 that she wanted to be a lawyer, and not long afterward gave her first public speech, in a subway station, while collecting for a Zionist youth organization. She went from Hunter College, where she was student body president, to Columbia University Law School, where she was an editor of The Law Review, to a practice representing union workers. Ms. Abzug traced the wearing of her trademark wide-brimmed hats to those days. She once recalled: ""When I was a young lawyer, I would go to people's offices and they would always say: 'Sit here. We'll wait for the lawyer.' Working women wore hats. It was the only way they would take you seriously. ""After a while, I started liking them. When I got to Congress, they made a big thing of it. So I was watching. Did they want me to wear it or not? They didn't want me to wear it, so I did."" All the while, she was a leftist and an agitator. Later, exasperated with her Congressional aides, she wrote: ""I just don't understand young people today, quite frankly. Our struggle was political, ideological and economic, and we felt we couldn't make something of ourselves unless we bettered society. We saw the two together."" In the 1950's, Ms. Abzug's law practice turned to other cases identified with the left. One client was Willie McGee, a black Mississippian convicted of raping a white woman and sentenced to death. Ms. Abzug, who was pregnant at the time, argued the case in Mississippi while white supremacist groups threatened her. Though the Supreme Court stayed the execution twice, Mr. McGee was eventually executed. She also represented people accused of Communist activities by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Congressional committee and its counterpart in Albany. In the 1960's, Ms. Abzug became an antiwar activist. A founder of Women Strike for Peace, she became its chief lobbyist, protesting nuclear testing and, later, the Vietnam War. She organized insurgent Democrats into other groups, too, becoming a leader of the movement against President Lyndon B. Johnson and a prominent figure in the 1968 Presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy. During those years, Ms. Abzug started navigating New York City politics. She and her husband, Martin, moved from Mount Vernon, the Westchester suburb where they had raised their two daughters, to a town house at 37 Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In 1970, Ms. Abzug ran for Congress. The 19th Congressional District, which snaked from lower Manhattan to the West 80's, had four registered Democrats to every Republican and had been represented in Congress for seven terms by Leonard Farbstein, a solid but rather somnolent liberal. Ms. Abzug won the Democratic primary with 54 percent of the vote. Campaign Became A Women's Crusade At this point, Bella Abzug became national news, a flash of local color in a political year. She seemed to be everywhere, clapping backs and jabbing biceps. Her campaign headquarters next to the Lion's Head, a writers' and journalists' bar in Greenwich Village, was also a day-care center for her legions of female volunteers. The women's crusade she led brought considerable, if sometimes derisive, attention. Though she eventually took 55 percent of the vote, she had genuine Republican opposition, unusual in an era when New York's main political action consisted of various Democratic factions knifing one another. The Republican-Liberal candidate was Barry Farber, a well-known radio talk show host. Mr. Farber drew many Democrats who resented Mr. Farbstein's humiliation or were simply put off by Ms. Abzug's style. To her chagrin, Mr. Farber accused Ms. Abzug, who advocated direct negotiations between Israelis and Arabs, of flagging in her support of Israel. For years after that, she made a point of stating her Jewish credentials, dating to childhood: her family was religious and she went regularly to synagogue (though she was bothered that women were relegated to the back rows of the balcony), studied Hebrew and was enrolled for a time at the Jewish Theological Seminary. When Ms. Abzug went to Washington, she sought an appointment to the Armed Services Committee. She wanted a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam and she vowed to take on the military-industrial complex. She wanted to end the draft. She wanted national health insurance, money for day-care centers and housing, and more money for New York City, all to be paid for with billions siphoned from the Pentagon's budget. She got little of this, but during the next six years ""she was indefatigable,"" Ms. Newberg recalled. ""She yelled a lot,only because she couldn't get everything done."" And if she couldn't, Ms. Newberg added, it was partly because ""her agenda was too pure for her moment in time."" Ms. Abzug did become expert at parliamentary rules, worked them skillfully and was famously well prepared for every vote, hearing and committee spat. The ""sunshine law"" requiring governing bodies to meet publicly came out of a subcommittee she headed. She coaxed funds for New York from the Public Works Committee. She was a co-sponsor of the women's equal rights amendment. ""She was one of the most exciting, enlightened legislators that ever served in the Congress,"" said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, with whom Ms. Abzug sometimes collaborated and sometimes sparred. From her first day on Capitol Hill -- the day she dismayed her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution -- Ms. Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, the log-rolling and back-scratching. She did not spare fellow Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over committee appointments and votes. She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in her journal, ""Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?""), then announced to Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam. For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to get along, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House. Still, a 1972 report by Ralph Nader estimated that Ms. Abzug's sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who repaired to the Lion's Head one night, holding his side and swearing never to work for Ms. Abzug again. ""She punched me,"" he explained, in a quarrel over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin reported, Ms. Abzug called the aide. ""Michael, I called to apologize,"" she said. ""How's your kidney?"" Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a Democratic Party luminary: ""Are you the man that used to be head of the Xerox?"" Ms. Abzug asked. ""That's right,"" Mr. Linowitz replied. ""I'm glad to meet a big shot,"" Ms. Abzug said. ""I'm in hock $35,000 on my campaign."" Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. ""Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related to most people at this point,"" she wrote in 1971. ""I feel detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they don't know it."" Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with her husband. She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers met on a bus in Miami, when both were on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin concert. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two published novels, had next to no interest in politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his wife was out of the room, ""The political bug is a curious bug."" But he was, she said, her best friend and supporter, and ""one of the few unneurotic people left in society."" Corrosive Ambition Hampers a Career Ms. Abzug's own ambition was too corrosive for many people, even -- or, perhaps, especially -- for her fellow New York Democrats. When the State Legislature sliced up her district in 1972, they urged her to challenge one of the two conservative incumbent Democrats in adjoining districts, Representative John J. Rooney or Representative John M. Murphy. Instead, she opposed a liberal Democrat, William Fitts Ryan, in the 20th District, encompassing the Upper West Side and the Riverdale section of the Bronx. The primary was bitter and, eventually, politically expensive to Ms. Abzug. Bill Ryan was one of the earliest heroes of the city's insurgent Democrats, an early opponent of the Vietnam War and a genuinely well-liked man who, as many of his constituents knew, was waging a gallant fight against cancer. Mr. Ryan defeated Ms. Abzug in the Democratic primary but died before the general election. The Democratic County Committee appointed Ms. Abzug as the candidate to replace him, but she was challenged by Mr. Ryan's widow, Priscilla, who ran on the Liberal line. Ms. Abzug won in November, but she had made dedicated enemies who believed she was an overly aggressive politician who would not hesitate to attack anyone who got in her way. Ten years later, she was denied a seat in the state's delegation to the national party's biannual conference because New York leaders considered her disruptive. In 1976, she gave up her House seat to run for the Senate. She lost in the primary, to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, by a margin of only 1 percent. Two more campaigns quickly followed. (In a 1978 interview, she said: ""I'm a politician. I run for office. That's my profession."") She lost to Edward I. Koch in a crowded mayoral primary in 1977. The next year, running for the House again, she lost, again by just 1 percent, to a little-known Republican, S. William Green. She was appointed co-chairwoman of President Jimmy Carter's National Advisory Committee on Women, and then, after disagreeing with him over economic policy, was dismissed. The majority of the committee members resigned in protest. Ms. Abzug, unapologetic, said with a shrug, ""I've got to find myself another big, nonpaying job."" Her next and last campaign was in 1986, this time for a House seat in Westchester County. She won the primary in a burst of the old, ebullient campaigning style, but lost in November to Joseph J. DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent. It was during that campaign that Martin Abzug died. Her friends said Ms. Abzug never recovered. Nine years later, she said, , ""I haven't been entirely the same since."" There was one more bid for office, for her old House seat on the Upper West Side, when she announced her candidacy to replace Representative Ted Weiss on his death just before the 1992 election. But she was quickly eliminated from the field at the party convention. During the next decade, Ms. Abzug suffered from ill health, including breast cancer, but continued to practice law and work for women's groups. She wrote a book, ""Gender Gap,"" with her old friend Mim Kelber. She started a lobbying group called Women U.S.A. and founded the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a group that works with international agencies. In addition to her daughters, Eve and Liz, Ms. Abzug is survived by her sister, Helene Alexander of Great Neck, N.Y. ""I've been described as a tough and noisy woman, a prizefighter, a man hater, you name it,"" Ms. Abzug said of herself in ""Bella."" ""They call me Battling Bella, Mother Courage and a Jewish mother with more complaints than Portnoy."" ""There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am -- and this ought to be made very clear at the outset -- I am a very serious woman."""

Goldsmith, an economist who for several decades was a leading authority on national income and wealth, died of heart failure Tuesday at the Whitney Center, a retirement community in Hamden, Conn.","Raymond W. Goldsmith, an economist who for several decades was a leading authority on national income and wealth, died of heart failure Tuesday at the Whitney Center, a retirement community in Hamden, Conn. He was 83 years old and had lived for many years in New Haven. Dr. Goldsmith was regarded as a pioneer in developing ways to measure wealth and in devising balance sheets that record the flow of funds among segments of the economy. He served for many years with Government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, from its early days in the 1930's, and the War Production Board in World War II. He was also a longtime member of the senior research staff of the National Bureau of Economic Research and was a professor of economics at Yale University from 1960 until 1974. ''Raymond Goldsmith was one of the major scholars of his period in the examination of national wealth,'' Richard Ruggles, retired chairman of the economics department at Yale, recalled yesterday. ''He virtually created the field of wealth measurement, starting in the early 30's and continuing right up to the 70's. He was very instrumental in building up statistics on the American economy that the Federal Reserve Board and other agencies use to track such things as the flow of funds among financial institutions.'' Consultant to Governments Professor Ruggles, who brought Dr. Goldsmith to Yale, noted that the economist had been a consultant to numerous foreign governments, including those of many developing countries, among them India and Brazil. He was called on to advise several international commissions and undertook several missions abroad for United States agencies. Robert Nathan, a consumer economist, praised Dr. Goldsmith yesterday as ''one of the most precise and scientific economists of recent times,'' adding that ''unlike a lot of policy-oriented people, he never picked a bunch of numbers and ran with them; he was very careful to utilize data properly.'' And Solomon Fabricant, retired director of research at the National Bureau, called Dr. Goldsmith ''perhaps the major figure in designing the national accounts, including gross national product, wealth estimates, savings trends and export-import balances.'' Chief among Dr. Goldsmith's published works was the three-volume ''A Study of Savings in the United States,'' completed in 1955, which isolated and measured the elementary relationships among personal, corporate and government saving over 50 years. He wrote voluminously on the economy from 1933, the year before he joined the S.E.C., when he produced ''The Changing Structure of American Banking,'' until 1985, when his last book, ''Comparative National Balance Sheets: A Study of 20 Countries, 1688-1978,'' was published. Raymond William Goldschmidt - he later Anglicized his name - was born Dec. 23, 1904, in Brussels. He received his doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1927 and moved to the United States in 1934. After five years at the S.E.C., he became chief of its research section and assistant director of the trading and exchange division in 1939. From 1942 to 1946 he served on the staff of the War Production Board, directing its planning division the last two years. Missions for State Department In 1945 he went to Paris on the staff of the American delegation to the conference on war reparations, and in the next three years he undertook various missions for the State Department, including serving as adviser to the German Currency Reform Commission and to the American delegation at the major Allied conference on the Austrian peace treaty. Dr. Goldsmith was chairman or a member of several key committees studying economic problems for the Federal Reserve Board and other national and international government agencies. In 1963 and 1964 Dr. Goldsmith, on leave from Yale, was vice president of the newly founded Development Center of the Office for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, and in this country he served later on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers. Dr. Goldsmith was married in 1939 to the former Selma E. Fine, who was also an economist. She died in 1962. He is survived by a brother, Lucien Goldschmidt of Manhattan; a daughter, Jane, of San Francisco; two sons, Donald, of Berkeley, Calif., and Paul, of Amherst, Mass., and a granddaughter. A funeral service will be held tomorrow at 11:30 A.M. at the Hawley Lincoln Funeral Home at 493 Whitney Avenue in New Haven."

Agent Who Investigated Klan Bombing","Frank Spencer, an F.B.I.","TAMPA, Fla., June 7 Frank Spencer, an F.B.I. agent who helped investigate the 1963 Ku Klux Klan church bombing in Birmingham, Ala., that became a rallying point for the civil rights movement, died here on Friday. He was 87. The cause was lung cancer, his family said Tuesday. Mr. Spencer was 82 when he testified in 2001 about the bombing at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, which killed four black girls, Denise McNair, 11, and Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley and Carole Robertson, all 14. They died in a basement room of the church while preparing for Sunday services. In the 1970's, a former Klansman, Robert E. Chambliss, was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to life in prison, where he died almost a decade later. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reopened its investigation into the bombings in the 1990's at the urging of black pastors. Two former Klansmen were then indicted, Thomas Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry. In 2001, Mr. Spencer testified against Mr. Blanton, who was eventually convicted of murder and is serving a life sentence. Mr. Blanton says he is innocent. Mr. Cherry was also convicted and sentenced to life, and died in prison in 2004. Mr. Spencer testified that Mr. Blanton gave conflicting accounts of his whereabouts on the two nights before the blast. Mr. Spencer almost did not make it to the trial. He was hospitalized with heart failure while traveling and persuaded his cardiologist to accompany him to the trial so he could testify. Mr. Spencer had been with the Tampa F.B.I. office just a few weeks when he was assigned to join agents from across the country to work on the bombing case. He stayed with the Tampa office until 1977, when he retired. After his F.B.I. career, Mr. Spencer was hired to head the Tampa office of the Florida Division of Insurance Fraud. He retired from that job in 1987."

He was 83 years old. General Casey, who was born in Brooklyn, ended his unsalaried service for the city in 1955. At the time, he declared that the Transit Authority would end the year with a $6.5 million surplus. A career soldier who helped draft the original plans for the design of the Pentagon in the late 1930's, General Casey served as General MacArthur's chief engineer during World War II. He was at the general's victory celebration when Japan surrendered in 1945. 31 Years of Army Service General Casey received the Distinguished Service Cross and the Silver Star for bravery in action, as well as the Distinguished Service Medal and numerous other medals and citations during his 31 years of service. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant upon his graduation from the United State Military Academy in 1918; he retired from the Army in 1949. After serving as head of several peacetime engineering projects after World War I, General Casey was assigned to Manila in 1937 as a military engineering adviser to the Philippine Government, serving under General MacArthur. At the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific, General Casey participated in the defense of the Philippines. He accompanied General MacArthur to Australia before the fall of Corregidor in 1942. After his retirement, General Casey served briefly as executive vice president of the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He then joined Schenley Industries as vice president for its laboratories. He retired as Schenley's corporate secretary in 1965. A Warning to the City General Casey held several unsalaried positions in New York City, serving as chairman of the lay advisory board at Metropolitan Hospital Center in addition to his tenure as chairman of the fivemember Transit Authority from 1953 to 1955.

26977,"Willie Turnesa, Last Brother In Golfing Family, Dies at 87","Willie Turnesa, the youngest of the famous golfing Turnesa brothers and the last surviving brother, died Saturday at Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.","Willie Turnesa, the youngest of the famous golfing Turnesa brothers and the last surviving brother, died Saturday at Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. He was 87. The cause was pneumonia, said Pauline Sparling, one of his daughters. Three of the seven Turnesa brothers were top touring pros in the 1930's and 40's, and Willie, the only brother who did not turn pro, was widely considered the best amateur in golfing history after Bobby Jones. He won the United States Amateur Championship in 1938 and 1948 and the British Amateur Championship in 1947, and he was runner-up in the British in 1949. He was also a member of three winning Walker Cup teams, serving as captain of the 1951 squad. Just months after graduating from Holy Cross College, he won the 1938 Amateur at Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania, where his accurate bunker shots helped him win the nickname Willie the Wedge. The Turnesa brothers were called the greatest family dynasty in golf history. It was said that they were to golf what the Kennedys were to politics. They were born to Vitale Turnesa, an Italian immigrant who over 50 years worked his way up from day laborer to head greenskeeper at Fairview Country Club in Elmsford, N.Y. The boys were not allowed to practice on the course, so they set up a makeshift course around their house and called it Turnesa Country Club. Each of the boys caddied, and each put his earnings in the family fund. They began winning local caddie tournaments, and one by one they turned pro, except for Willie. Joe, Mike and Jimmy became top touring pros, and Doug, Frank and Phil were local teaching pros. The six older brothers all worked locally as club professionals but also won dozens of local and national tournaments. They competed against golf's great players, including Walter Hagen, Bobby Jones, Gene Sarazen and Ben Hogan. In 1938, RKO flew the brothers to Bermuda to make a 10-minute short newsreel film, ""The Golfing Brothers,"" with the three youngest professionals playing the three oldest for a bottle of Champagne. The six were regular contenders in the finals of all the United States major tournaments, and Jim Turnesa won the 1952 P.G.A. Championship. Mike Turnesa finished second to Ben Hogan in the 1948 P.G.A. Mike, head professional for 44 years at Knollwood Country Club in Westchester, died Oct. 31 at 93. William P. Turnesa was born Jan. 20, 1914, and lived his entire life in Elmsford until spending his final years in a home for the elderly in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. He served as president of both the Metropolitan and New York State Golf Associations in the mid 1950's. At that time, he also co-founded what is now known as the Westchester Golf Association Caddie Scholarship Fund, which has awarded millions of dollars to college-bound students. ""It was his enduring legacy and unquestionably his proudest achievement,"" Mrs. Sparling said. ""He was prouder of the caddie fund than any of his championships."" Willie's older brothers forbade him to turn pro, she said, and he become a sales executive for a container company instead. ""It wasn't easy making a living, even as a top pro, at that time,"" Mrs. Sparling said. ""They told him, 'You can't do this,' and they pooled their money to send him to college."" Willie played good golf well into his 70's, often at Knollwood Country Club. He would play, then retire to the grillroom for martinis and games of gin rummy, recalled Bobby Orman, 63, the caddie master at Knollwood. ""I can't count the number of kids he helped with his caddie fund,"" Orman said. Turnesa's wife, Mary Agnes, died in 1996 after 55 years of marriage. Besides his daughter Pauline, he is survived by a son, Charles, of Belleville, N.J., his daughters Anne Lawday of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Margaret Burchnall of London, and a sister, Mildred Recchia of Yonkers. Vitale Turnesa was a humble man who worked five decades on a golf course and never played the game. When a neighbor once relayed news that Willie had become the United States Amateur champion, he replied: ""He should be. It's all he's ever done."" The boys' mother, Anna Turnesa, tried to dissuade her sons from becoming golfers. She banished all golf trophies to the basement and kept a religious shrine in the living room. She wanted Willie to become a priest."
24896,"Maria A. Rudzinska, 92, Zoologist and Professor","Maria A. Rudzinska, a protozoologist who used electron microscopy to uncover the eating habits of the parasite that causes malaria, died last Friday at her home in Manhattan.","Maria A. Rudzinska, a protozoologist who used electron microscopy to uncover the eating habits of the parasite that causes malaria, died last Friday at her home in Manhattan. Dr. Rudzinska, who was an emeritus professor of parasitology at Rockefeller University, was 92. She came to Rockefeller in 1951, at a time when the use of the electron microscope in biology was in its infancy. She trained with the cell biologists Keith Porter and George Palade and then joined the laboratory of William Trager, a leading parasitologist. It was in Dr. Trager's lab that she used the microscope to show that the malaria protozoa, a one-celled organism that enters the human body through mosquito bites, consumes red blood cells by ingesting portions of them into parts of its cell called vacuoles. ""It is a common way for cells to feed,"" said Dr. Trager, now an emeritus professor of parasitology at Rockefeller. ""But no one had guessed that this was the way malaria parasites feed."" Dr. Trager said her work also confirmed that the parasite entered the blood cell before eating it. ""There was some controversy as to whether the parasite was inside the cell or not,"" he said. ""At the level of the light microscope, it was not easy to be sure."" Her research helped scientists find ways to treat the disease, he said. The malaria parasite was not Dr. Rudzinska's favorite protozoa, however, Dr. Trager said. That distinction fell to an organism called tokophrya. Unlike most single-cell organisms, which live a rather mundane life restricted largely to dividing, tokophrya, she discovered, has specific life cycles. ""As a baby, it's a swimming little thing,"" Dr. Trager said. ""But then it settles down, forms a stalk, and metamorphoses into quite a different-looking creature."" It also has a reproductive cycle, and a period of old age. ""The thing she found was, if you give it a lot to eat, this process of aging was greatly accelerated,"" Dr. Trager said. Overfed, tokophrya grew old faster and died earlier. The organism has been used by researchers who study the aging process. Dr. Rudzinska, who was so identified with the protozoa that she once received a post card at the laboratory addressed only to ""Dr. Tokophrya,"" occasionally had difficulty finding specimens, which proliferate in fresh water ponds. After one steady source on Long Island dried up, she found some closer to home -- in a fountain on the Rockefeller campus. Dr. Rudzinska became an emeritus professor in 1975, but was still active in the lab. In her later years, she worked with Harvard researchers to discover how the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is carried by deer ticks. She was born in Dabrowa, Poland, and earned advanced degrees in biology and zoology from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. During World War II, she taught at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lvov, and participated in underground teaching during the Nazi occupation. After the war she came to the United States with her husband, Alexander Rudzinski, an international lawyer who was a member of the Polish delegation to the fledgling United Nations. When the Communists took over the Polish Government, however, Mr. Rudzinski resigned, and the couple were granted asylum in the United States. Her husband died about five years ago."

Marsden, a specialist in tropical medicine who trained doctors in Uganda and Brazil and became a world expert on parasites, died on Oct. 4 in his home in Brasilia, where he had lived since 1974. He was 64. The cause was a stroke, family members said. Dr. Marsden, who was born in London, received his M.D. degree at University College Hospital in London and did his thesis on children's health in Gambia. He taught at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, at Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, and at Mulago Hospital, a part of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. He began fieldwork in Brazil in 1967, was named a professor of tropical medicine at the University of Brasilia and became a leading authority on leishmaniasis, an often-fatal disease borne by sand flies. He set up clinics in the Amazon, published widely -- including chapters in medical textbooks used in Britain and the United States -- and trained numerous Latin American doctors in parasitology. He received the Order of the British Empire and the Chalmers Medal of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. He is survived by his wife, Maria; a sister, Christina Redding of Southampton, N.Y.; a son, Andrew Philip Marsden, and a daughter, Vanessa Giorgio, both of London, and three grandchildren. His marriage to Susan Marsden ended in divorce."
7563,"Jerome Brody, 78, Is Dead; Guided Elegant Restaurants","Jerome Brody, who transformed the restaurant culture of New York as operator of a series of glittering restaurants like the Four Seasons, the Rainbow Room, Gallagher's Steak House and the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Terminal, died on Tuesday at his home in Miami.","Jerome Brody, who transformed the restaurant culture of New York as operator of a series of glittering restaurants like the Four Seasons, the Rainbow Room, Gallagher's Steak House and the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Terminal, died on Tuesday at his home in Miami. He was 78. He died of lung disease, said Bryan Reidy, manager of Gallagher's. Mimi Sheraton, a former restaurant critic for The New York Times, said that Mr. Brody, working with Joseph H. Baum, ""introduced for the first time, in a classy way, the theme restaurant."" For example, at their Rockefeller Center restaurant The Forum of the Twelve Caesars, Champagne was chilled in containers resembling the helmets of Roman centurions, and a featured dish was Wild Boar Marinated and Served on the Flaming Short Sword. As Mr. Brody explained to Fortune magazine in 1960, ""We are New York guys and we have tried to express in all our restaurants the idea of the elegant, perhaps you might say the shiny side of contemporary New York."" The restaurants, all owned by Restaurant Associates, of which Mr. Brody was president, became the stage for great human dramas, not least when President John F. Kennedy arrived at the Four Seasons in 1963 in an open convertible with no police escort. When Mr. Brody asked if he wanted to visit the kitchen, the president immediately agreed, saying, ""That's where all the Democrats are."" Later that year, after Mr. Brody and his first wife, Grace, divorced, his father-in-law fired him from Restaurant Associates, which he controlled. On his own, he took over the management of the Rainbow Room in 1964, when it was no longer a glittering mecca, and immediately sprinkled his own magic on the Art Deco nest at the top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. In March 1964, two months after he took over, the room had its first major party in years, the opening-night celebration for ""Funny Girl."" The New York Times reported, ""With Barbra Streisand's tumultuous entrance, which resembled the climax of a Busby Berkeley musical, the Rainbow Room swiftly returned to the New York cafe society scene."" Soon, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were fox-trotting in the Rainbow Room, and Caroline Kennedy stopped by with her aunt, then Princess Stanislas Radziwill, for tea and French pastries. In 1967, Mr. Brody persuaded Duke Ellington to play an engagement with just seven members of his band, the first time he had played in New York with such a small group in four decades. Mr. Brody's empire started with a handful of cafeterias and coffee shops, and almost no financial backing. He built his success mainly on one idea: having someone else pay for the space. According to Lawrence S. Freundlich in ""A Time Well Spent"" (Welcome Rain Publishers, 2000), he identified landlords in need of strong restaurants with sound management plans. The landlords contributed retail space and capital for construction and equipment in return for a percentage of gross income and the prestige a popular restaurant can bring to a building. ""Thus, with little working capital, Brody was eventually able to place Restaurant Associates in first-rate locations, create a presence in the restaurant world out of all proportion to the company's wealth, and give it a clout, which considering its humble origins was all the more remarkable,"" Mr. Freundlich wrote. Ira Jerome Brody was born in Manhattan on Oct. 17, 1922. His father, Jacob, made a fortune in the hat business and sold his company before the stock market crashed, but then lost nearly everything in real estate. He started another successful hat company. Young Jerome attended the Ethical Culture School, where he told the headmaster that he aspired to be a millionaire. He attended Dartmouth College; during his sophomore year, he married Grace Wechsler and joined the Army Air Force. ""The movies were filled with stories of people who went off to war and got killed, so they got married first,"" he told Mr. Freundlich. He served on the home front, teaching pilots to fly B-24's. Rather than return to Dartmouth, he decided to go directly to Columbia Law School. But his father-in-law, Abraham F. Wechsler, stopped in after three top executives of his coffee business died in succession. ""You can't go to law school, you have to come down and join me in my coffee business,"" he said. Mr. Brody obeyed. The young man was put in charge of Riker's, a chain of lunch counters and cafeterias the coffee company had acquired. He quickly upgraded menus. ""Riker's Corner House at 57th Street must have been the first hamburger joint in the United States to offer beef in burgundy wine sauce,"" Fortune reported. He also began to improve appearances and was delighted to find that a redecorated coffee shop far outsold those that had been left alone. But Riker's lacked sufficient capital to refurbish the chain in a systematic way. In the first step of Mr. Brody's strategy to find someone else to foot the bill for rent and other expenses, he began to seek concessions for his company to run. The first was the food concession at Mitchell Air Force Base on Long Island; the second was the employee's cafeteria of Ohrbach's department store in Manhattan. Then came Newark Airport, where he won the food concession from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and teamed with Mr. Baum, who had been recruited from a Florida hotel chain, to create the Newarker restaurant. The chef, Albert Stockli, created a menu featuring delicacies like Absecon oysters, called ""knife and fork oysters"" because they were so large they had to be eaten with a knife and fork. In 1955, the Newarker's fifth year of operation, it was serving 1,000 meals a day, 90 percent of them to nontravelers, and earning half as much as the entire Riker's chain. Also in the early 1950's, Restaurant Associates beat out Howard Johnson and Marriott to win the New York State Thruway Authority food concession between Syracuse and Buffalo. But the public was more aware of the dazzling successes of the new theme restaurants Mr. Brody and Mr. Baum were creating, as they and other executives darted about the world collecting legends and ideas. In addition to the Forum, there was La Fonda del Sol in the Time & Life Building, and most spectacular, the Four Seasons, where Mr. Brody and Mr. Baum worked with leading designers like Philip Johnson and Eero Saarinen to create a radiant restaurant in Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building. Many have suggested that the big ideas for the Four Seasons, from the Picasso painting to the Saarinen furniture in the ladies' room, came from Mr. Baum, but a news release for Mr. Freundlich's book argued that it ""clearly discredits the prevailing myth that Joe Baum, a Brody hire, was the prime mover responsible"" for Restaurant Associates. Ms. Sheraton said Mr. Brody did not get the credit he thought he deserved for both collaborating with and managing the brilliant Mr. Baum. Of their professional relationship, she said, ""Jerry kept him on a very long leash."" After Mr. Brody was forced out of Restaurant Associates in 1963, he not only managed the Rainbow Room for 11 years but also saved two famous but flagging restaurants. One of them, Gallagher's Steak House on West 52nd Street, was in serious decline when he bought it in 1963, but it soon had lines outside. The Oyster Bar was bankrupt, in disrepair and chained shut when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority asked him to take it over in 1974. It has become a bustling destination in Grand Central Terminal. Mr. Brody then became a gentleman farmer in Ghent, N.Y., first breeding prize-winning Angus cattle and then thoroughbred horses. One of his first horses, Allez Milord, was an international champion. His Adorable Micol was the New York State champion broodmare last year. In 1999, he sold the Oyster Bar and Gallagher's to employees, but remained active in managing both and kept the rights to franchise restaurants under both names elsewhere. Gallagher's restaurants have opened in Las Vegas, Denver and Princeton, N.J., and another is scheduled to open in San Antonio this year. Oyster Bars are to open this year in Kansas City and San Antonio. Mr. Reidy, the Gallagher's manager in Manhattan, said Mr. Brody was a very attentive boss. ""He was as gentle as a lamb, but could strike like a cobra,"" he said. ""He didn't understand"

Nixon's re-election campaign, died on Friday at the Park Avenue home of her son Robin. She was 89. Mrs. Farkas, who lived in Palm Beach, Fla., had been staying with Mr. Farkas and his wife, Carol, a nurse, in Manhattan since her release two weeks ago from the New York University Medical Center, where she had been treated for a heart ailment. Despite the uproar that surrounded Mrs. Farkas's appointment and a delay in her Senate confirmation, her posting caused little stir in the tiny grand duchy of Luxembourg, which was accustomed to Americans whose path to ambassadorships was paved with political contributions. Although Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas cast his Foreign Relations committee vote against her and denounced her appointment as demeaning the Foreign Service, Senator Gale W. McGee of Wyoming said he was satisfied that Mrs. Farkas was innocent of any impropriety and laughed about the custom of making envoys of people who make generous campaign contributions. ""The money -- that's par for the course,"" he said. ""It used to be a cheaper price -- but that's Nixon inflation."" In contrast to Ambassador Perle Mesta, the Washington socialite who arrived in Luxembourg in 1949 with flamboyant ways and gala parties that inspired the Broadway musical ""Call Me Madam,"" Mrs. Farkas, who held a doctorate in sociology from Columbia University and a doctorate in education from New York University, maintained a low profile. Reserved by nature and press-shy because of the uproar that surrounded her appointment, she was more at ease as the sponsor of forums on the drug problems of teen-agers than in being a second coming of a woman known as the hostess with the mostest. Not until two years after Mrs. Farkas arrived did she make her first splash in the social life of Luxembourg, with a charity gala that featured the singer Sacha Distel and a United States Army orchestra. The event took in $28,000 for a school for handicapped children. She maintained close ties with the Government, gave quiet and unpretentious parties and, unlike many envoys, avoided making political statements about United States policy. Most diplomatic work was carried out by her six-member staff, and in the Luxembourg diplomatic community, which then included 13 other ambassadors, Mrs. Farkas, though serious, was not considered a heavyweight. President Gerald R. Ford accepted her resignation in 1976 and replaced her with Rosemary L. Ginn, a longtime Republican national committeewoman from Missouri. Mrs. Farkas settled in Florida and resumed her many philanthropic and humanitarian activities and research into male and female roles through the Role Foundation, which she established in 1967. Ruth Lewis, one of five children of Samuel Lewis and the former Jennie Bach, was born in Manhattan in 1906. Both her parents were in the real estate business and each influenced her. ""Community living and sharing, that was my mother; intellectual pursuits, that was my father,"" Mrs. Farkas once said. Accompanying her mother into tenements taught her about poverty, and Mrs. Farkas never forgot her mother's advice: ""No matter what your station in life, no matter what you grow up to be, always try to contribute to those less fortunate than you."" She met George Farkas when she was 10. Their families lived in the same apartment house, at 107th Street and Fifth Avenue, where George, whose father had died, kept a close eye on his little sister, who was Ruth Lewis's best friend. ""I didn't like him at first because he was such a boss,"" she said. They were married in 1928, but not until she graduated from New York University. She received a master's degree from Columbia in 1932 and was for many years a member of the executive committee of Alexander's. Mr. Farkas died in 1980. In addition to Robin, Mrs. Farkas is survived by three other sons, Alexander of Highland Park, Fla., and Bruce and Jonathan, of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren."

He was 89. Mr. Louis designed the strapless black satin gown in which Rita Hayworth sang ""Put the Blame on Mame"" and shimmied her way to fame in ""Gilda."" He was also responsible for the glittering ""beads and skin"" dress worn by Marilyn Monroe for her breathless rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" to President John F. Kennedy in Madison Square Garden in 1962. The dress, which gave new meaning to the term form-fitting, was designed to be so tight that Mr. Louis later said he had to have Miss Monroe sewn into it. He also designed the gowns for Loretta Young's legendary entrances in 52 episodes of her ""Loretta Young Show,"" which ran on NBC from 1953 to 1961. Many women were so intrigued with the clothes he designed for Miss Young, whom he later married, that they tuned in to the show mainly to see what she was wearing. Mr. Louis switched from designing for private customers in New York to Hollywood in 1943 when he became head designer at Columbia Pictures. He made the move at the suggestion of a customer, Joan Cohn, the wife of Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia. He later went on to Universal studios. Over four decades he created designs either for the films or the personal closets of almost every star in Hollywood, some 200 of them, including Lana Turner, Vivien Leigh, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Betty Grable, Judy Garland, Greta Garbo and Katharine Hepburn. His 60 film credits included ""A Star is Born,"" ""Judgment at Nuremberg,"" ""Pal Joey,"" ""Ship of Fools,"" ""Born Yesterday"" and ""From Here to Eternity."" He won an Academy Award in 1956 for his designs for ""The Solid Gold Cadillac,"" starring Judy Holliday. He was nominated for 13 additional Academy Awards and on two occasions, in 1954 and 1961, received multiple nominations, for both black and white and color movies. Born Jean Louis Berthault in Paris in 1907, he trained there with the designer Drecoll. He came to the United States in 1936 and was hired as one of the lead designers at Hattie Carnegie, with Claire McCardell and Norman Norell. The following year he designed the trim little suit that became a classic, the Carnegie suit, one of the first fashions to become popular as an American name design. The suit, which had a fitted, buttoned top, nipped waist and narrow skirt, was worn by everybody who was anybody in society and fashion at the time. The Duchess of Windsor was one of his private clients, along with Nancy Reagan, Irene Dunne, Jane Wyman and Gertrude Lawrence. At Columbia, he was the only costume designer at the time to be given full film credit. The films on which he worked carried the credit ""Gowns by Jean Louis."" While at Columbia, Mr. Louis liked to recall, he became a mentor to the designer James Galanos, who was working as his assistant. When Mr. Galanos left to open his own business in 1951, Mr. Louis's friends said yesterday, Mr. Louis lent $500 to Mr. Galanos. In the early 1960's, Mr. Louis severed his relationship with the studios, opened a salon in Beverly Hills, Calif., and continued to design for the movies on a freelance basis. He retired in 1988. In 1993, Mr. Louis married Miss Young, a friend of more than a half-century. Mr. Louis's first wife, Maggy, who died in 1987, had been Miss Young's best friend. In addition to Miss Young, Mr. Louis is survived by a brother, Adrian, of Paris. In 1981, Miss Young said of her future husband, ""I love his clothes because they are understated high fashion and yet seductive at the same time."""

He was 80 years old. He died of cancer, said officials of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. During the nearly 40 years he worked in Hollywood, Mr. North was nominated for an Academy Award 15 times but did not receive an Oscar until the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented him with a lifetime achievement award in 1986. It was the first honorary Oscar given to a composer. That year he also received Ascap's first Golden Soundtrack Award for lifetime achievement in film composition. Mr. North was born in Chester, Pa., and studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, the Juilliard School in New York City and the Moscow Conservatory of Music. He also studied composition with Aaron Copland. Among his compositions were ballets for Martha Graham, Agnes de Mille and Anna Sokolow, as well as two symphonies and orchestral and chamber pieces. His ""Revue for Clarinet and Orchestra,"" commissioned by Benny Goodman, was given its premiere in 1946 by Mr. Goodman, Leonard Bernstein and the New York City Symphony. The Move to Hollywood Mr. North moved from the East Coast to Hollywood in 1951 to write the score for the film version of ""Death of a Salesman,"" having composed the music for the Broadway production of Arthur Miller's play.

29265,"Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, 66, Leader In Judaism's Conservative Branch","Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, a major leader of Conservative Judaism for four decades who helped professionalize the American rabbinate and pave the way for the ordination of women as rabbis, died yesterday at the New York University Medical Center.","Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, a major leader of Conservative Judaism for four decades who helped professionalize the American rabbinate and pave the way for the ordination of women as rabbis, died yesterday at the New York University Medical Center. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan. The rabbi died of a melanoma that spread, a colleague, Rabbi Julra Harlow, said. Although he never led a congregation, Rabbi Kelman had a great impact on American rabbis. As the executive vice president of the Conservative movement's Rabbinical Assembly, he served as mentor to hundreds of rabbis, guiding them in both spiritual and temporal matters. He organized retreats for rabbis away from the pressures of their congregations, where they could study and reflect under the guidance of prominent scholars. He also worked to insure that rabbis had competitive salaries and benefits, like job security, housing, pensions and insurance. Modern Hasidic Master The descendant of Hasidic rabbis from Poland, Rabbi Kelman functioned as a kind of modern-day Hasidic master, even though he departed from the strict Orthodoxy of his forebears. At his rambling apartment on West End Avenue and at his cramped office at Manhattan's Jewish Theological Seminary, Rabbi Kelman dispensed advice and spiritual counsel to Jews who were exploring or discovering their religious roots. He was born in Vienna in 1923 and moved to Canada with his family as a young boy. His father, Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kelman, died when he was 13, and his mother, left with six children, stepped into the role of community leader in Toronto, offering religious and personal guidance. ''It was her example that made me believe women could function as rabbis,'' Rabbi Kelman said many years later. Women were first ordained in Conservative Judaism in 1985. During World War II Rabbi Kelman served in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and after the war he was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he was a disciple of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. In the 1960's he accompanied Rabbi Heschel to Selma, Ala., where they marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and he helped prepared Rabbi Heschel for his meeting with Pope Paul VI. A 'Rabbi's Rabbi' At the urging of Rabbi Heschel and Dr. Louis Finkelstein, the former chancellor of the seminary, Rabbi Kelman passed up congregational positions to work as a ''rabbi's rabbi'' at the Rabbinical Assembly. When he took the position in 1951, there were 300 Conservative rabbis; when he retired last year there were 1,200. Conservative Judaism grew substantially during that period as Jews moved out of cities and into the suburbs, where the 100-year-old movement flourished. Conservative Judaism respects the authority of Halacha, traditional Jewish law, but believes that it can change as it confronts modern issues like technology, feminism and pluralism. While the standing of rabbis improved markedly over his years at the Rabbinical Assembly, Rabbi Kelman refused to take credit for being any more than someone who eased the way for others. ''The status of rabbis improved because of the hundreds of good rabbis out there,'' he said. Aside from his activities within the Conservative movement, Rabbi Kelman worked to improve ties between the branches of Judaism, between American and Israeli Jewry and between Christians and Jews.

42781,"Theodore Lowi, Zealous Scholar of Presidents and Liberalism, Dies at 85","Theodore J. Lowi, a venerated political scientist who challenged conventional scholarship on presidential power and identified the emergence of what he called ''interest-group liberalism,'' died on Feb. 17 in Ithaca, N.Y.","Theodore J. Lowi, a venerated political scientist who challenged conventional scholarship on presidential power and identified the emergence of what he called ''interest-group liberalism,'' died on Feb. 17 in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 85. His death was confirmed by his daughter, Anna Lowi. Professor Lowi taught at Cornell University from 1959 to 1965, returned in 1972 and remained the John L. Senior professor of American institutions until he was granted emeritus status in 2015. Coupling academic expertise with charisma, he popularized his theories with an evangelical zeal and a Southern drawl in lectures, television appearances and groundbreaking books, which he was said to have dictated verbatim into a tape recorder. They included ''The End of Liberalism: The Second Republic of the United States'' (1969), ''The Politics of Disorder'' (1971), ''American Government: Incomplete Conquest'' (1976) and ''Hyperpolitics: An Interactive Dictionary of Political Science'' (2010), written with Mauro Calise. He also edited ''The Pursuit of Justice'' (1964), Robert F. Kennedy's book about his tenure as attorney general. Professor Lowi was named the nation's most influential political scientist in a poll of the American Political Science Association's members in 1978. He was the president of that group in 1991 and of the International Political Science Association from 1997 to 2000. ''Lowi's scientific personality was a unique mix of extraordinary empirical knowledge and bold theoretical vision,'' Ilter Turan, the president of the international association, said in a statement. In his seminal study of liberalism -- philosophical rather than political -- Professor Lowi wrote that ''modern liberalism has left us with a government that is unlimited in scope but formless in action,'' a government that ''can neither plan nor achieve justice because liberalism replaces planning with bargaining and creates a regime of policy without law.'' He argued that special-interest politics began during the New Deal and fragmented power further with the decline of the two-party system ''to replace elected representation with interest groups as proxies for citizen participation.'' Those groups, he wrote, could paralyze government and thwart the popular will. Critiquing Professor Lowi's ''The Personal President'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1985, Hendrik Hertzberg praised ''The End of Liberalism'' as an ''influential and highly original work'' and summed up ''The Personal President'' this way: ''Mr. Lowi shrewdly describes the presidency as an increasingly 'plebiscitary' office. Its occupant uses television and polls to commune directly with the masses, bypassing such mediating institutions as Congress and the political parties. Having given our presidents big power, we expect big things of them -- especially in terms of 'service delivery,' which, Mr. Lowi writes, has displaced representation as the test of democracy and legitimacy. ''Despite the aggrandizement of the executive branch at Congress's expense, though, there are still 'built-in barriers to presidents' delivering on their promises,''' Mr. Hertzberg continued. ''The result is a dangerous cycle -- substantive failure, followed by frantic White House efforts to create false images of success, followed by adventurism abroad, followed by further public disillusion -- all of which forces the next president to turn the rhetorical heat up even higher.'' Professor Lowi acerbically coined what he called the ''Law of Succession,'' which holds that each new president enhances the reputation of his predecessors. He also posed a corollary: ''This is the only certain contribution each president will make.'' Theodore Jay Lowi was born on July 9, 1931, in Gadsden, Ala., to Alvin Lowi and the former Janice Haas. Israel Sergio Waismel-Manor, a lecturer at the University of Haifa in Israel and a former student of Professor Lowi's, wrote of him this month, ''He was not a religious person, but coming from the Deep South, and having played music with his mother and his siblings at the local Jewish temple, he was really an Evangelical, a preacher who followed his own apostles: Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton and V. O. Key.'' An illness forced Mr. Lowi to drop out of Tulane University, but he recovered -- determined, he once said, someday to ''be in the history books.'' Instead, he would write them. He attended Michigan State University on a music scholarship (he played the oboe) and graduated in 1954. He earned a master's and a doctorate in political science from Yale. His first marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Angele Marie Daniel, died in 2015. In addition to their daughter, he is survived by their son, Jason; his brothers, Alvin Jr. and Bertram; and his sisters, Jan Horn and Bettie Baer. Professor Lowi maintained that ''political science is a harder science than the so-called hard sciences because we confront an unnatural universe that requires judgment and evaluation.'' That was one reason he sought to expose Cornell students to practical politics with an undergraduate program for research and teaching in the nation's capital. His own political experience was uninspiring. In 1958, he managed the campaign of George Hawkins of Gadsden in the Democratic primary for governor of Alabama. Mr. Hawkins finished sixth in a field of 14. He also campaigned for Senator Eugene McCarthy in the 1968 Democratic presidential primaries and was an advocate for third-party presidential candidates, including Representative John B. Anderson, who ran and lost in 1980. Despite those losses, Professor Lowi's fervor was undiminished. ''Among the sins of omission of modern political science, the greatest of all has been the omission of passion,'' he said in a speech to the American Political Science Association when he completed his term as president. He did not mean the passion of ideology, he explained, but ''the pleasure of finding a pattern, the inspiration of well-rounded argument, the satisfaction of having made a good guess about what makes democracy work, and a good stab at improving the prospect of rationality in human behavior.'' He continued: ''This is not an opportunity to play philospher-king. It is an opportunity to meet our own intellectual needs while serving the public interest. And we need not worry how to speak truth to power. It is enough to speak truth to ourselves.''"
57825,"The Rev. Marcial Maciel, 87, Conservative Catholic Leader","he Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, founder of the influential Roman Catholic group the Legionaries of Christ and the most prominent priest disciplined after accusations of sexual abuse, died Wednesday, the group announced Thursday.","ROME The Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, founder of the influential Roman Catholic group the Legionaries of Christ and the most prominent priest disciplined after accusations of sexual abuse, died Wednesday, the group announced Thursday. He was 87. Father Maciel, who was born in Mexico, where he lived most of his life, died at an unspecified location in the United States, the Legionaries said in a statement. Born on March 10, 1920, in Michoacan State, Father Maciel founded the Legionaries in 1941 as a conservative movement active both in training priests and in organizing lay people, and he remained its charismatic leader. The group, also known as the Legion of Christ, has 650 priests worldwide, 2,500 seminarians in 20 countries and 50,000 members in its lay affiliate, Regnum Christi. The Legionaries run a dozen universities, including their first degree-granting college in the United States, the University of Sacramento. A friend to many Mexican politicians and business executives, Father Maciel played a major role in several of Pope John Paul II's visits to Mexico. The pope frequently praised him and the Legionaries, calling him an ''efficacious guide to youth'' during a visit in 1994. That description prompted several former Legion seminarians to go public with allegations that Father Maciel abused them from the early 1940s to the early '60s, when they were 10 to 16 years old. Nine of them made their claims public in 1997 in newspaper articles and then a book, ''Vows of Silence: The Abuse of Power in the Papacy of John Paul II'' (Free Press, 2004), by Jason Berry and Gerald A. Renner. One accuser later recanted, calling the allegations fabricated. Father Maciel repeatedly denied the charges. ''I never engaged in the sort of repulsive behavior these men accuse me of,'' he said in 2002. But as scandals erupted in the United States involving abuse by priests, the case became a symbol of what critics said was the church's unwillingness to acknowledge the problem or to punish offenders. In 1999 an inquiry about Father Maciel -- who had been investigated in the 1950s for possible drug abuse but cleared -- was shelved, reportedly by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who was in charge of enforcing church doctrine. But in late 2004, several months before John Paul died, Cardinal Ratzinger reopened the investigation. He was elected pope in April 2005, taking the name Benedict XVI; the next year, in May, the Vatican issued a rare public censure, addressed to Father Maciel. Without addressing the charges specifically, the Vatican statement said Father Maciel had been asked to give up his public ministry in favor of a quiet life of ''prayer and penitence.'' News reports at the time said he had been barred from saying Mass publicly or giving speeches or interviews. Reaction from the accusers and groups that represent other victims of abuse by priests varied. Some praised the move as a virtual admission of guilt, while others complained that it did not go far enough because there had been no explicit resolution of the charges, and that Father Maciel had not been expelled from the priesthood. In 2006, Pope Benedict canonized Father Maciel's great-uncle, Bishop Rafael Guizar Valencia, a missionary who had tended to the wounded in the Mexican revolution in 1910. He died in 1938."

34446,"Eugene Rostow, 89, Official At State Dept. and Law Dean","Eugene V. Rostow, a legal scholar who helped create Yale Law School's current eminence and later became a vigorous defender of the Vietnam War as a senior State Department official, died today at an assisted-living residence in Alexandria, Va.","WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 Eugene V. Rostow, a legal scholar who helped create Yale Law School's current eminence and later became a vigorous defender of the Vietnam War as a senior State Department official, died today at an assisted-living residence in Alexandria, Va. He was 89. Like his more famous younger brother, Walt, who was President Lyndon B. Johnson's national security adviser and an architect of the administration's Vietnam strategy, Mr. Rostow, who served as under secretary of state for political affairs, was part of a generation of hawkish Democrats. Deeply influenced by World War II, they saw fighting Communism in Southeast Asia as central to a policy of global containment. The Brooklyn-born son of a Socialist, who named him for the party's presidential candidate, Eugene Victor Debs, Mr. Rostow exemplified the strain of hard-headed, Democratic thinking on foreign policy and defense that flowered in the 1960's. He finished his public career as the highest-ranking Democrat in the Reagan administration, as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. He was also an affable and erudite scholar, with a taste for bow ties and vests, fine food and wine, who as dean of Yale Law School from 1955 to 1965 built its endowment. He was renowned for recruiting more than a dozen top legal scholars in 1956, during a period of turmoil at the school over the lack of promotions for faculty members who had clerked for liberal justices. ""He was perhaps the greatest dean the law school ever had,"" said one of his later recruits, Guido Calabresi, now a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. ""The school was deeply divided when he took over and through his generosity of spirit and reverence for the institution, he made things right."" Judge Calabresi added that his deanship ""had all the qualities of optimism that helped get him in trouble over Vietnam."" As a young Yale professor, in 1945, Mr. Rostow published a law review article condemning the government's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, at a time when that policy had gone largely unquestioned. In 1983, he was forced to resign as head of the arms control agency after President Ronald Reagan concluded he was not hawkish enough in his approach to negotiations with the Soviet Union. Through it all, Mr. Rostow remained blunt and unapologetic for views that made him unpopular with many fellow intellectuals and former colleagues. In 1968, the Sidwell Friends School, an elite Quaker institution here, withdrew an invitation to speak at a son's graduation because of his position on Vietnam. ""A balance of power is the only possible foundation for peace,"" Mr. Rostow wrote in The New York Times in 1969. ""The system which kept the general peace between 1815 and 1914 has vanished. If a new balance is to be attained and secured -- and such a balance defines our national interest in world politics -- we shall have to continue to take the lead in doing so: the pressure against equilibrium is now stronger, more diverse and more difficult to control than was the case in the late 40's."" His son Victor recalled tonight that his father was, first and always, a lawyer, and saw the world in those terms. ""You must recognize that he was a lawyer,"" the younger Mr. Rostow recalled, ""and it was his belief that the United States had obligations in Asia under the Seato treaty, and quite apart from that, we were the sole power that could contain the Communist insurgency. Unlike his brother, who was in many ways an architect of our Vietnam policy, he was one of the most articulate defenders of that policy."" Mr. Rostow graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale at 19, then went on to earn a law degree there before joining the faculty in 1938. Ineligible for military service in World War II because of a bad back, he worked as an adviser in the State Department, principally on lend-lease matters, before returning to Yale. In 1966, President Johnson named him under secretary of state for political affairs, which made him a frequent diplomatic point man on Vietnam. His son said he never doubted that his position was right, but added that he understood that there were aspects of the war that were not good for America. Indeed, in a 1972 article in The Times, Mr. Rostow called the degradation of public discourse the heaviest blow Korea and Vietnam have inflicted upon the American spirit. In addition to his son Victor, he is survived by his wife of 69 years, the former Edna Berman Greenberg, a psychotherapist; another son, Nicholas, of Manhattan; a daughter, Jessica, of New Haven; his brothers Walt, of Austin, Tex., and Ralph, of Sarasota, Fla.; and six grandchildren."

He was 87. The death was confirmed by his daughter Susan. Although his principal field was colonial religious history, Professor Gaustad ranged far and wide as a scholar. He explored the contested territory of religious liberty, pluralism and dissent in colonial America, but he also wrote general histories that carried the story forward to the present day and published a series of atlases, frequently updated, that gave a geographical picture of religious belief in the United States. His first book, ''The Great Awakening in New England'' (1957), made the case that the religious revival fanned by preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield had more than religious importance, profoundly affecting political and intellectual life in America. He also challenged the revisionist view that the movement was really an economic and class insurgency, arguing that it enjoyed support among all classes. ''The Awakening was 'Great' because it was general: none escaped its influence or avoided its controversy,'' he wrote. ''In both coastal and frontier areas, within cities and rural communities, in churches and in open fields, people gathered to hear an earnest evangelistic gospel, be it preached by their own minister, a neighboring pastor, a trespassing itinerant or an exhorter.'' He went on to write several histories of religion in America that became classic texts for students and historians alike, notably ''A Religious History of America'' (1966), revised with Leigh Schmidt and republished as ''The Religious History of America'' in 2002; ''Dissent in American Religion'' (1973); and ''Faith of Our Fathers: Religion and the New Nation'' (1987). One of his most ambitious projects was ''Historical Atlas of Religion in America,'' first published in 1962 and reissued in revised and updated editions in 1976 and 2001. Professor Gaustad's interest in religious liberty, and evolving notions of the relationship between church and state, led to an abiding fascination with Roger Williams, the theologian who helped found Rhode Island and established the first Baptist church. He wrote about Williams in ''Liberty of Conscience: Roger Williams in America'' (1991) and in a short biography, ''Roger Williams'' (2005). ''My interest in him relates principally to his historic contributions to religious liberty -- a full freedom in matters of the soul,'' he told the journal Church and State in 2005. ''Williams advocated the scariest political heresy of his day: namely, that a civil institution could survive without the supporting arm of the church. He was alone in this view in all New England, alone in most of the other colonies, and certainly alone in his own homeland of England.'' Edwin Scott Gaustad (pronounced GOW-sted) was born on Nov. 14, 1923, in Rowley, Iowa, and grew up in Houston. After serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II, he earned a bachelor's degree from Baylor University in 1947. At Brown University, where he studied under the historian Edmund S. Morgan, he received his doctorate in 1951. After teaching at Shorter College (now University) in Rome, Ga., and the University of Redlands in California, he accepted a teaching post in 1965 at the University of California, Riverside, where he remained until retiring in 1989. In addition to his daughter Susan, of Manhattan, he is survived by a son, Scott, of Ukiah, Calif.; another daughter, Peggy, of Santa Fe; four grandchildren; and one great-grandson. In 2002 Professor Gaustad, whose ''Church and State in America'' had been published in 1999, appeared as an expert witness in a widely publicized lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and other groups, against an Alabama judge who refused to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the state courthouse. In his testimony for the plaintiffs, he invoked Thomas Jefferson, the subject of his book ''Sworn on the Altar of God: A Religious Biography of Thomas Jefferson'' (1996). Jefferson, he told the court, had ''an undying anxiety of anything that would bring church and state together,'' adding: ''He was not against religion. He was against any combination of power with religion.'' When asked by Judge Myron H. Thompson of Federal District Court in Montgomery, Ala., if it would help to add a disclaimer to the bottom of the monument saying ''We're not compelling anyone to believe,'' Professor Gaustad said yes -- but ''moving it to private property would help more.''"

59039,"Jean-Paul Riopelle, 78, Artist Inspired by the Surrealists","Jean-Paul Riopelle, one of Canada's most celebrated modern artists and an important figure in postwar French art, died on March 12 at his home on the Ile aux Grues, an island in the St. Lawrence River east of Quebec City.","Jean-Paul Riopelle, one of Canada's most celebrated modern artists and an important figure in postwar French art, died on March 12 at his home on the Ile aux Grues, an island in the St. Lawrence River east of Quebec City. He was 78. Living in France during the most productive decades of his career, Mr. Riopelle practiced a European variant of American Abstract Expressionism. He was inspired in the mid-1940's by the Surrealist idea of automatism -- painting intuitively without preconceived images or compositional ideas -- to create expansive, allover fields of gestural mark-making. His early, wildly expressionistic work was compared to that of Jackson Pollock, but in the early 1950's Mr. Riopelle began painting more methodically, using palette knives to build up thick, patchy surfaces in saturated colors, creating effects suggestive of stained glass and mosaics. In the 60's, he began to add images of birds, animals and landscapes, but retained the combination of physically assertive paint and luminous, decorative color. Mr. Riopelle was born on Oct. 7, 1923, in Montreal, where his father was an architect. He started painting at 8 and in the late 30's began to study architecture while attending the Ecole Polytechnique. He soon returned to his first love, studying painting at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and Ecole du Meuble in Montreal from 1943 to 1945. He first exhibited there in 1946 with a group of painters called Les Automatistes. Shortly thereafter he left for Paris, where he socialized with such luminaries of the European avant-garde as Alberto Giacometti, Joan Miro and Samuel Beckett. Andre Breton and Marcel Duchamp included him in the last major group show of the Surrealist movement in 1947. During a brief return to Canada in 1948, Mr. Riopelle became the co-founder of Refus Global, a group of Quebec artists who publicly rejected Canadian social conservatism, including the dictates of the Roman Catholic Church. In accordance with his atheism, his funeral on March 18, which was attended by more than 900 people, was a nonreligious ceremony that substituted jazz and rap pieces for traditional hymns. Mr. Riopelle's career peaked in the 50's. He was included in the Venice Biennale in 1952 (receiving the Unesco Prize that year) and in 1954. He received an honorable mention at the Sao Paulo Biennial in 1955, was awarded a Guggenheim International Prize in 1958, and exhibited paintings and large expressionistic bronze sculptures at the 1962 Venice Biennale. He also exhibited regularly at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York. In his later years he received many honors, including the Order of Canada and the Grand Prix de la Ville de Paris. Mr. Riopelle lived with the American Abstract Expressionist painter Joan Mitchell from 1955 to 1979, mostly in France. Over the years he revisited Canada with increasing frequency until resuming permanent residence there in the early 1990's. He is survived by his companion of 15 years, Huguette Vachon; a daughter, Yseult Riopelle of Montreal; and a son, Ian Fravalo-Riopelle of Paris."

Minarik III, an energetic political operative who was the New York State Republican chairman from 2004 to 2006, a time of declining fortunes for the party, died on Sunday in Rochester.","Stephen J. Minarik III, an energetic political operative who was the New York State Republican chairman from 2004 to 2006, a time of declining fortunes for the party, died on Sunday in Rochester. He was 49 and lived in Webster, N.Y. Assemblyman William D. Reilich, the Monroe County Republican chairman, said Mr. Minarik had a heart attack. He had had a stroke in 2001. In his two-year tenure, Mr. Minarik struggled to find candidates to compete against Eliot Spitzer for governor, Hillary Rodham Clinton for senator and other strong Democrats in 2006. He failed to unify his party behind the former Massachusetts governor, William F. Weld, for the governorship; the nomination went to John J. Faso, a former Assembly minority leader, who was crushed by Mr. Spitzer. Mr. Minarik championed Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, for the Senate, but she withdrew after failing to attract money or attention, and later fell short in a bid for state attorney general, a post won by Andrew M. Cuomo. In the Senate race, Mr. Minarik finally endorsed former Mayor John Spencer of Yonkers, who was trounced by Mrs. Clinton. After the 2006 elections, which produced a Democratic sweep of statewide offices and the worst defeat for New York Republicans since the Great Depression, Mr. Minarik resigned as state chairman and was succeeded by Joseph N. Mondello, Nassau County's Republican chairman. But Mr. Minarik remained chairman of the Monroe County Republicans until 2008, when he resigned after 16 years in the post. Stephen J. Minarik III was born in Rochester on Jan. 2, 1960, the son of Stephen J. Jr. and Eleanor Minarik. He graduated from Irondequoit High School in 1978 and the University of Rochester in 1982. A year later, he became a clerk for the Monroe County Legislature's Republican majority. He worked in campaigns that elected Representative Fred J. Eckert and Monroe County Executive Lucien A. Morin. In 1990, he became executive director of the Republican county organization and two years later was elected its chairman. He led a Republican takeover of the county Legislature, helped elect three consecutive county executives, and candidates for sheriff and town supervisors, a record that led to his selection as state chairman. Mr. Minarik is survived by his wife, Renee Forgensi Minarik, a State Court of Claims judge in Rochester and Buffalo; a son, Stephen IV; a daughter, Stephanie; two stepchildren, Christopher and Kathleen; and a brother, Daniel, of Rochester. Growing up in Rochester, Mr. Minarik developed a passion for conservative politics early. He promoted friends for the student council in high school and for student government at the University of Rochester, where he majored in political science. Later, he used his talents to elect candidates to county and state offices. But he never yearned to be a candidate. ''I love getting people elected,'' he said when Gov. George E. Pataki named him state chairman after the party's poor showing in the 2004 elections. ''I never wanted to be elected myself. There is a huge difference between being a candidate and being an operative. A candidate is out front every day. He or she has to shake hands and smile. I don't have the personality for that.''"

He was 84 years old. Mr. Miller, who had homes in Palm Beach and Pittsford, N.Y., outside of Rochester, died of pneumonia, according to The Assocated Press, which Mr. Miller also headed during his tenure as president and chairman of Gannett. He was the first employee of The A.P. to lead the news service, a cooperative operated for its member newspapers. Although much of his career was spent as an executive, Mr. Miller always thought of himself as a reporter. He was one of only three reporters who, in 1945, boarded an Army C-54 Skymaster, the ""Globester,""for a 151-hour, globe-circling flight that took off and landed in Washington, D.C. The flight marked the opening of a weekly service by the Army's Air Transport Command and presaged global commercial service. Inspired Acclaimed Series Even after he became an executive, Mr. Miller seized opportunities to write a story. In 1971, while vacationing in the Far East, he interviewed Eisaku Sato, then Japan's prime minister, and filed a story. In 1963, while president of Gannett, Mr. Miller inspired a series of articles on the positive aspects of integration that would win a Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for his newspaper chain. Born in Diamond, Mo., on Sept. 28, 1906, Mr. Miller's career in journalism began when at the age of 15 he won a national editorial-writing contest for high school students. ""Inflated by this triumph,"" he said, ""I hung around the Pawhuska, Okla., Daily Journal until they gave me a job."" Mr. Miller left Oklahoma A&M, now Oklahoma State University, to edit The Daily Leader in Okemah, Okla. Okemah ""was a tough town,"" Mr. Miller once said. Readers there were not satisfied to write a complaining letter to the editor. ""The phone would ring,"" Mr. Miller said, ""and the call always went about like this: 'Is this the editor? Well, get set. I'm coming down to beat the hell out of you.' On March 10, 1932, Mr. Miller was hired as a rewrite man by The A.P.'s office in Columbus, Ohio. There he met Louise Johnson, an editor for The Columbus Journal, whom he would marry seven months later. Move to Gannett Over the next decade, Mr. Miller worked his way through a series of reporting positions with The A.P. to become the service's bureau chief in Washington. Mr. Miller joined Gannett in 1947, serving as executive assistant to the founder, Frank E. Gannett. He soon took on added duties as editor and publisher of The Rochester Times-Union in New York, an afternoon paper, and publisher its morning counterpart, The Democrat and Chronicle. Retaining his positions on the Rochester papers, Mr. Miller succeeded Mr. Gannett in 1957 as president and chief executive officer of the chain. The Gannett group then included 19 daily newspapers in four states. Under Mr. Miller's leadership, it began making acquisitions, not in big cities but in growing communities. By the time he became chairman of Gannett in 1970, the company's holdings included 53 daily newspapers in 16 states and on Guam. Gannett now owns 82 daily newspapers with a total circulation of 6.4 million, making it the nation's largest newspaper group. Mr. Miller's successor at Gannett, Allen H. Neuharth, devotes a chapter of his autobiography, ""Confessions of an S.O.B.,"" to describing how he maneuvered to replace Mr. Miller as chief executive in 1973. Mr. Miller was elected president of The Associated Press, a part-time position, in 1963. The title was changed to chairman in 1972. That year, he and other executives of The A.P. negotiated an agreement with the Chinese news agency, Hsinhua, for the exchange of news and photos. It marked the first time in 22 years that an American news organization had established a regular news link with China. Mr. Miller retired as chairman of The A.P. in 1977, and as chairman of Gannett a year later. Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Jean Miller Gordon; three sons, Ranne, Paul, and Kenper; two sisters, Elizabeth Wright and Louise Campbell; a brother, Horace; 10 grandchildren, and one great-grandson."

He was 88. Mr. Koch, who was born in Grand Forks, N.D., received degrees in drama and sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where his father, also a drama professor, founded and directed the Carolina Playmakers. After graduating in 1933, he began his career as a social worker and statistician for the Tennessee Valley Authority in the Great Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina. He left two years later to go on the road with a puppet show that promoted dental health. By 1937 Mr. Koch had developed his own puppet show and toured the country with his wife, Edna Bryant, who had worked as a director. They wrote their own shows and made their own puppets, often discussing their construction as part of the entertainment. In 1939, after completing his master's degree at Chapel Hill and a brief teaching stint at the University of Virginia, he joined the faculty of the University of Miami, where he set out to build a drama department and a theater. Seven years later he organized the first Ring, a theater in the round housed in the rotund tower of a turreted three-story hotel on the university's north campus in Coral Gables. The Ring was later moved to a mammoth circular tent on the main campus. By 1950 work had begun on the $125,000 permanent structure in which the architects Robert M. Little and Marion I. Manley incorporated features like a revolving stage and moveable riser units to seat 600 people who would never be more than eight rows from the stage. Called by some America's most flexible theater, it permitted proscenium and horseshoe as well as central staging. The raised seats on rollers could be rearranged in an endless variety of ways to bring the audience and performers into a closer relationship. The theater was inaugurated in February 1952 with a performance of Mary Ellen Chase's play ""Harvey."" In addition to the Ring, Mr. Koch developed a smaller theater with a conventional proscenium stage, the Box, in which aspiring playwrights would have their work produced in exchange for an evaluation by the audience. Among the students was Jerry Herman, who would later write ""Hello Dolly,"" ""Mame"" and ""La Cage aux Folles."" Mr. Koch is survived by three sons, Frederick III and Christopher Alan, both of Miami, and Thomas Bryant of Burnsville, N.C.; two brothers, Robert Alan, of Princeton, N.J., and William Julian, of Glendale, Ariz.; seven grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. ""Arena playing bursts the picture frame and flows into a third dimension of movement, and perhaps a fourth dimension of the human heart and mind,"" Mr. Koch said of his creation in a 1951 interview in The New York Times. ""The audience no longer watches a play. It is enfolded by it and vibrates with it. Through intimacy the new-old theater restores the right of the audience to see and hear and delight in every detail."" http://www.nytimes.com"

31305,Tomas Young Dies at 34; Faulted Iraq War in Film,"Paralyzed from the chest down, the Iraq War veteran is seen in a 2007 documentary film taking dozens of pills for spasms, pain and depression.","Paralyzed from the chest down, the Iraq War veteran is seen in a 2007 documentary film taking dozens of pills for spasms, pain and depression. He speaks agonizingly about his sexual problems. Viewers watch him marry and, eight months later, divorce. In the film, ''Body of War,'' Tomas Young is the body. Co-directed and underwritten by the television personality Phil Donahue, the film sought to show, through Mr. Young, the devastating human cost of a war that the filmmakers argued should have never been fought. Mr. Young died at 34 on Nov. 10 at his home in Seattle. When asked the cause, his mother, Cathy Smith, said, ''His body just wore out.'' ''Body of War'' received the National Board of Review award for best documentary. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave it strong consideration for an Oscar nomination. Reviews were mixed, but almost all said it was hard hitting. Mr. Young spoke of his ordeal on ''60 Minutes,'' ''Nightline'' and ''Bill Moyers Journal.'' But the film, though applauded at film festivals, was not released theatrically; its producers could not find a distributor. (It can be found, however, on Internet streaming services.) In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Donahue suggested one possible reason distributors shied from it. ''It's not a take-your-girl-to-the-movies movie,'' he said. Another reason may have been its polemic tone. Images of Mr. Young's agony are interspersed with shots of the congressional debate over the resolution giving President George W. Bush the authority to invade Iraq in March 2003. The film shows Mr. Young in the forefront of demonstrations against the war by veterans and lobbying members of Congress to stop it. Six years after the film came out, Mr. Young drew news media coverage when he announced that pain and depression had pushed him to decide to commit suicide. He wrote an open letter to President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney on behalf of ''the human detritus your war has left behind, those who will spend their lives in unending pain and grief.'' The movie had its roots in Mr. Donahue's antiwar commentary on his MSNBC talk show in the run-up to the Iraq invasion. In February 2003, the channel canceled his show, citing low ratings, particularly compared with its direct competitor on Fox News, ''The O'Reilly Factor,'' whose host, Bill O'Reilly, was a strong supporter of the war. The seeds of ''Body of War'' were planted in the spring of 2004 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, where Mr. Young had been taken after sniper fire severed his spine on his fifth day in Iraq. By her account, Ms. Smith asked her son, who had long been interested in politics, inspired by her liberal views, if there was anybody he wanted to meet in Washington. ''Ralph Nader,'' he said. She called Mr. Nader's office, and he agreed to meet Mr. Young. He asked Mr. Donahue to accompany him. The two had met on Mr. Nader's presidential campaign bus in 2000. Mr. Donahue said he was ''blown away'' by Mr. Young's wounds and came to see the young man as a potential vehicle for showing the sacrifices the troops were making in Iraq, which he thought had been deliberately hidden from the public. Mr. Donahue said he had considered writing a book but was persuaded that a movie would be better. He teamed with Ellen Spiro, an experienced filmmaker, who shared producing and directing duties with him. Another veteran of Mr. Nader's presidential races, Eddie Vedder of the rock group Pearl Jam, volunteered to write and perform two songs for the film. In the movie, Mr. Young recalls enthusiastically enlisting in the Army after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But he became disillusioned, he says, beginning when he was sent to Iraq rather than Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden had masterminded the attacks. ''If I had been shot and hurt in Afghanistan, I'd have been upset about what I have to go through, but there would be no 'Body of War' film,'' he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2008. ''I'd take my government check and sit home. I would not have felt my wounds were received in an invalid war.'' Tomas Vincent Young was born in Boise, Idaho, on Nov. 30, 1979, and grew up in Kansas City, Mo. His mother and father, Thomas Young, divorced when he was a boy. Tomas enlisted in the Army at 17 but was discharged because of a shoulder problem. Returning to Kansas City, he took a succession of minimum-wage jobs. Then came Sept. 11. ''I called my recruiter after hearing Bush say he was going to smoke the evildoers out of their caves,'' he told the Kansas newspaper The Topeka Capital-Journal in 2007. His shoulder passed muster in February 2002, and after basic training he landed at Fort Hood, Tex., as a private in the First Cavalry Division. He was shot in Baghdad on April 4, 2004, while lying in an open truck as it rolled through the Sadr City neighborhood. He had emergency surgery in Germany before being flown to Walter Reed. The documentary shows Mr. Young at one point saying goodbye to his younger brother, Nathan, as his brother deploys for the first of two combat tours in Iraq. It shows him marrying his high school sweetheart, Brie Townsend, who says she can handle the challenges they will face. And it shows them divorcing eight months later. While Mr. Young was in a rehab center in Chicago, he met Claudia Cuellar, who had volunteered to visit hospitalized veterans to cheer them up. Though his condition had deteriorated, they wed on April 20, 2012. He decided against suicide. The couple moved to Portland, Ore., because medical marijuana was available there. They then moved to Seattle, partly because Mr. Young had come to regard Mr. Vedder, who lives there, as a friend. Besides his mother, Mr. Young is survived by his wife, his father and his brother Nathan; his sister, Lisa Harper; another brother, Tim Weaver; and two grandmothers."
43460,"Jimmy Lee Sudduth, Folk Artist, Is Dead at 97","Jimmy Lee Sudduth, an African-American folk artist whose evocative, textured paintings made partly from Alabama mud were prized by collectors around the world, died last Sunday in Fayette, Ala.","Jimmy Lee Sudduth, an African-American folk artist whose evocative, textured paintings made partly from Alabama mud were prized by collectors around the world, died last Sunday in Fayette, Ala. He was 97 and had lived in a Fayette nursing home in recent years. The Nelson Funeral Home in Fayette confirmed the death. A self-taught artist who began painting as a very small child, Mr. Sudduth was renowned for the effects he could produce with his own homemade paint, which consisted of mud blended with a variety of common substances -- soot, axle grease, sugar, coffee grounds and much else -- to lend it color and texture. Applied and worked with his fingers, the mud assumed contour, line and form. Painted on scrap lumber, sheet metal and most commonly on plywood, Mr. Sudduth's art often depicted everyday life in Alabama -- portraits of houses, people, farm animals and his dog, Toto. But it also ranged over the architecture of faraway places, as in his paintings of Washington landmarks and his geometric scenes of New York City skyscrapers. First exhibited formally in the late 1960s, Mr. Sudduth's work gained wide popularity during the folk art boom of the 1980s. Today his paintings sell for anywhere from several hundred dollars to $5,000, said Susan Mitchell Crawley, the associate curator of folk art at the High Museum in Atlanta. His art is in the permanent collections of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York, the Smithsonian Institution, the High Museum of Art and the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts. It was the subject of a book, ''The Life and Art of Jimmy Lee Sudduth'' (Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, 2005), by Ms. Crawley. Writing in The New York Times in 1997, Michael Kimmelman reviewed an exhibition at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture that included Mr. Sudduth's paintings. He described them as ''pictures of improbable chalky luminosity and understated bliss.'' Jimmy Lee Sudduth was born in Caines Ridge, Ala., on March 10, 1910. (His first name was sometimes spelled Jimmie.) The details of his early life are hazy: he was believed to have been born to a family named Wilson and adopted by the Sudduth family when he was very young, Ms. Crawley said in a telephone interview on Friday. The Sudduths moved around a great deal -- both of Jimmy's adoptive parents were itinerant farmhands -- and his formal education appears to have ended sometime in elementary school. As an adult, Mr. Sudduth could neither read nor write, Ms. Crawley said. Mr. Sudduth's adoptive mother was also a medicine woman, and as a toddler, he accompanied her into the woods to gather plants. On one of those trips, he drew a picture in mud on a tree stump. When he and his mother returned to the spot a few days later, the picture was still there. She took this as a sign that her son must keep painting, Ms. Crawley said. As an adult, Mr. Sudduth did a variety of jobs, including working in a grist mill, in a lumberyard and as a gardener. He continued to paint in mud, but there was a problem: once dry, the mud flaked off the plywood. Realizing he needed to add something to give the mud staying power, he found that viscous substances like molasses, honey, Coca-Cola and sorghum worked well. So did ordinary sugar. ''Sweet mud,'' Mr. Sudduth called the result. Meanwhile, Mr. Sudduth's wife, Ethel, wondered where all the household sugar was disappearing to. Over the years Mr. Sudduth became a connoisseur of dirt; he liked to say that he could locate mud in 36 different shades. Once he became famous, people sent him dirt through the mail, Ms. Crawley said. To expand his palette further, Mr. Sudduth colored his work with an astonishing array of available ingredients, either by mixing them into the mud or rubbing them directly onto his wooden canvas. They included flour, coffee grounds, instant coffee, dye wrung from sodden red crepe paper, ground brick, ground charcoal, colored chalk, crushed coal, turnip greens, flower petals, pokeweed berries, ivy, soot, axle grease, elderberries, crushed green tree buds, boiled jimson weed, sap, walnut shells, burnt matchsticks, tobacco, egg yolk, grass and leftover house paint donated by neighbors. The only drawback to these recipes was that some of the finished paintings were supremely attractive to mice, which ate holes in them. In later years, when advancing age made it hard for Mr. Sudduth collect mud, he switched to painting in acrylics. Mr. Sudduth's first wife died in 1941; his second wife, the former Ethel Palmore, died in 1992. Information on other survivors could not immediately be confirmed. A prolific artist who could finish a half-dozen pictures or more in a day, Mr. Sudduth was sometimes asked why he never used a paintbrush. ''I paint with my finger 'cause that's why I got it, and that brush don't wear out,'' he said in an interview quoted in the catalog of one of his exhibitions. ''When I die, the brush dies.''"
11324,"JOAN WILSON, 'MASTERPIECE THEATER' PRODUCER","Joan Wilson, the producer who brought ''Masterpiece Theater'' to American television, died of cancer Thursday in Boston.","Joan Wilson, the producer who brought ''Masterpiece Theater'' to American television, died of cancer Thursday in Boston. She lived in Marblehead, Mass. Mrs. Wilson, who once described herself as ''the single biggest customer'' of English television, had turned public television's weekly series into an addiction for many, bringing such series as ''I, Claudius,'' ''The Jewel in the Crown'' ''Crime and Punishment'' and ''Upstairs, Downstairs,'' to American audiences. She also produced the public television program ''Mystery,'' which included the series ''Rumpole of the Bailey'' and ''Reilly: Ace of Spies.'' A former actress, Mrs. Wilson was working for WGBH - Boston's public television station - in 1973 when she was offered the chance to produce ''Masterpiece Theater.'' Purchased 'Upstairs, Downstairs' Her first British purchase was ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' the ongoing story of the Bellamy family and its downstairs servants and set in Edwardian England. It was one of the first British television series to have a major impact on American viewer sensibilities. In the next few years, Mrs. Wilson was reported to often watch 60 to 70 hours a week of English television, looking for the right programs for her series. Sometimes she would choose a series she later decided she didn't like. For example, she said of ''Poldark,'' a ratings hit by public television standards: ''I had to stand up while watching it so I wouldn't fall asleep.'' Mostly, though, her programs were successful. They went on to win 13 Emmy Awards and two Peabody Awards. Mrs. Wilson would make casting suggestions, editing suggestions, and when the finished programs would arrive in the United States, she would even cut the already-produced material. ''Now I'll get floods of mail, saying, 'How dare you tamper with BBC?' '' she said in an interview in 1980. ''I get it all the time and its very wearying. I cut five minutes of 13 hours of 'I, Claudius,' and the American people, in their wonderful vitality and confidence, felt they could have done it better. My response is: 'Well, it's my job and not yours'.'' Mrs. Wilson, who was born in Wisconsin, consistently declined to disclose her age. She graduated from Grinnell College in 1950 and studied theater at the University of Wisconsin. She joined WGBH in 1967 where she produced drama programs including ''Classic Theater'' and ''Picadilly Circus,'' of which the actor Jeremy Brett, whom she later married, was the host. Mrs. Wilson is survived by Mr. Brett, whom she married in 1977; a son by a previous marriage, Caleb W. Sullivan; a daughter, Rebekah Wilson Giarusso; her mother, Esther Stanton Wilson, and a brother, John S. Wilson."
32500,"Joseph Muhler, 73, Dies; Made Crest Formula","Joseph Charles Muhler, a latter-day alchemist who helped turn stannous fluoride into tubed gold -- a dentifrice named Crest -- died on Dec. 24 at St. Joseph Medical Center in Fort Wayne, Ind.","Joseph Charles Muhler, a latter-day alchemist who helped turn stannous fluoride into tubed gold -- a dentifrice named Crest -- died on Dec. 24 at St. Joseph Medical Center in Fort Wayne, Ind. He was 73 and lived in nearby Sturgis, Mich. He suffered a brief illness, his family said. Dr. Muhler, a biochemist by training, led the team that came up with the original formula for Crest, a Procter & Gamble best seller, in the 1950's. He started its development in 1945 when the Navy, which had sent him to the Indiana Dental School, stopped supporting him. He had graduated that year and mustered the grants that allowed him to continue his research through graduate school. The idea was that fluorides, chemical compounds containing the element fluorine, held science's answer to tooth decay. At the time, dentists favored sodium fluoride, but there are many other fluoride compounds, and Dr. Muhler tinkered with some 150 of them. He persisted with the stannous -- or tin -- variety, believing it to be the most effective in hardening tooth enamel and protecting it from acids. He eventually proved it so. He received important encouragement from two mentors at Indiana University, Dr. Harry G. Day, his biochemistry teacher, and Dr. Grant Van Huysen of the dental school. A crucial contribution came from Dr. William H. Nebergall, an associate, when he baked a sample of toothpaste abrasive in a laboratory oven. Even as the work proceeded at Indiana University, Procter & Gamble was casting about for a decay-fighting toothpaste. The industrial giant was impressed enough with the results of Dr. Muhler's team to underwrite its work in 1949. He led the clinical field tests that proved the effectiveness of stannous fluoride as an ingredient in toothpaste. Procter & Gamble test-marketed Crest in 1955, and it went on sale nationally the next year. Eventually, other manufacturers developed their own fluoride formulas. Crest became the leading seller, especially after 1960, when the American Dental Association did what it had not done before: endorsed one specific brand of toothpaste. Its Council on Dental Therapeutics said there was proof hat Crest prevented tooth decay to a significant extent, and the association permitted advertisement of that. The endorsement became familiar to the entire generation of baby boomers: ""Crest has been shown to be an effective decay-preventive dentifrice that can be of significant value when used in a conscientiously applied program of oral hygiene and regular professional care."" Dr. Muhler, Dr. Day and Dr. Nebergall reaped some of the royalties for the invention. They, in turn, gave half the proceeds to Indiana University for dental research. Joseph Charles Muhler was born in Fort Wayne. He received his D.D.S. in 1948 from Indiana University, followed by a doctorate in chemistry in 1951, the year he joined the faculty as an assistant professor of chemistry. In 1972 he was named a research professor of dental science and director of the School of Dentistry's Dental Research Institute. He retired in 1984 but continued to write in his field. Dr. Muhler is survived by his wife of 47 years, Majetta Stewart Muhler; two sons, Dr. Joseph Jr. and James P., both of Fort Wayne, and five grandchildren."
60361,LORD SOAMES DIES; BRITISH STATESMAN,"Lord Soames, who as Britain's last colonial Governor in Rhodesia presided over its transition to majority rule as Zimbabwe, died today at his family home in Hampshire.","LONDON, Sept. 16 Lord Soames, who as Britain's last colonial Governor in Rhodesia presided over its transition to majority rule as Zimbabwe, died today at his family home in Hampshire. He was 66 years old. Lord Soames, a son-in-law of Sir Winston Churchill, had suffered a series of heart ailments and underwent surgery to remove an abdominal obstruction this year. He had a long and varied career of public service, serving as a soldier, Conservative politician and diplomat. His four-month stint as Governor of Rhodesia in the difficult months leading to up to elections and its independence in 1980 was his greatest achievement in public life, a task considered one of the most challenging in Britain's lengthy process of decolonization. Yet Lord Soames was credited with many other successes in his long political and diplomatic career. For example, he played a vital role in insuring Britain's entry into the European Economic Community as Ambassador to France from 1968 to 1972. A Taste for Wry Humor Lord Soames was a stout, balding man with mannerisms that some found imperious. In a conversation about him, Iain Macleod was once asked, ''What lies behind that incredibly bluff exterior?'' Mr. Macleod, who once served in the Cabinet with Lord Soames, reportedly pondered the question for a minute, then replied, ''Behind that incredibly bluff exterior lies an incredibly bluff interior.'' But close friends described him as serious in public yet often lighthearted and playful in private, a bon vivant with a taste for good wine and wry humor. Soon after his family announced Lord Soames's death this afternoon, tributes poured in from leading figures in the British Government and former colleagues. ''He gave a lifetime of unrivaled service to the country as a member of successive governments and Governor of Rhodesia during the transition to independence,'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said tonight. ''He was a towering personality and he will be very greatly missed.'' Lord Carrington, Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Foreign Secretary when Lord Soames was dispatched to Rhodesia, said, ''He did a job there that I don't think anyone else could have done.'' Dr. Herbert Murerwa, Zimbabwe's Ambassador to London, called Lord Soames's death ''a very sad loss,'' noting that ''he played a very significant and honorable part in the establishment of Zimbabwe.'' A Delicate Posting After talks in London in 1979 produced an agreement between Rhodesia's white leaders and black guerrillas to return to British colonial status in preparation for majority rule, Mrs. Thatcher sent Lord Soames to Rhodesia as Governor to preside over the transition. Though a seasoned diplomat, he had no African experience, assuring that he was not identified with any of the factions in the Rhodesian conflict. But it assured little else, and the posting was considered delicate and risky. The Rhodesian issue had been one of Britain's most nettlesome foreign policy issues since Ian D. Smith's unrecognized declaration of independence 14 years earlier. With a force of 1,200 soldiers from Britain and other Commonwealth countries, Lord Soames had to rely mostly on his considerable skills of persuasion, bluster and charm to oversee the election campaign. Despite factional violence and intimidation, the elections proceeded, with Robert Mugabe, a left-leaning nationalist, emerging as the Prime Minister. Arthur Christopher John Soames was born on Oct. 12, 1920, the son of a Buckinghamshire landowner. He was educated at Eton and at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, where he won a commission in the Coldstream Guards shortly before World War II broke out. He served in Italy, France and North Africa during the war, winning the French Croix de Guerre at El Alamein. After the war, he was sent to British Embassy in Paris as an assistant military attache. There, in 1946, he met Mary Churchill, the youngest of the five Churchill children, and they were married within a year. 'A Moving Relationship' In her best-selling biography of her mother, Clementine Churchill, Lady Soames recalled that ''from their very first meeting my father and Christopher took to each other.'' Lady Soames described the friendship between her father and her husband as ''a warm, a moving relationship, which grew in affection and trust.'' ''It had an enormous effect on Christopher's personality and life. And if my father gave much to Christopher, Christopher also was able to bring the breath of fresh air from outside.'' Mr. Soames, undoubtedly helped by his family connections, got a fast start in politics, first winning a seat in the House of Commons when he was 29 years old. He held his seat in Bedfordshire, northwest of London, for the Conservatives for 16 years, until 1966. In 1952, he became parliamentary private secretary to Sir Winston when he was returned to 10 Downing St. Later, he held junior ministerial posts before he entered the Cabinet in 1960 as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Mr. Soames was knighted in 1973 and made a life peer in 1978. From 1979 to 1981, he was leader of the House of Lords. Lord Soames was removed from Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet in what has been called the ''purge of 1981.'' Since 1979, Mrs. Thatcher has steadily removed the more liberal ''wets'' from the Cabinet, with the landed aristocrats and old Etonians like Lord Soames among the first to go. Lord Soames is survived by his wife and three sons and two daughters. Funeral arrangements were not announced."

Straus Jr., the brash and opinionated grandee who presided for nearly six decades over the book-publishing company that bore his name, the last surviving representative of the age of independent houses owned privately by gentlemen of literary taste, died Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan. The cause was pneumonia, said his son, Roger Straus III. With its distinguished list of authors and its course set almost entirely at the proprietor's discretion, Farrar, Straus & Giroux -- as it was known for much of its existence -- approached uniqueness as the conglomeration boom swept through the publishing trade in the 1960's and 70's. ''It's an object of great curiosity,'' an industry member told The New York Times in 1978. ''Very rare -- like an antique spinning wheel or a nickelodeon.'' But even Mr. Straus finally acknowledged the squeeze of market forces on his specialty shop. He sold the company 10 years ago to a European media giant, though he remained largely in charge. Mr. Straus, whose East Side town house doubled as one of New York's premier literary salons, was never shy about speaking out on behalf of his publishing style. He would say of the conglomerates that they were ''being run by accountants, businessmen and lawyers who have very little concern for the book.'' He concluded, ''They could just as well be selling string, spaghetti or rugs.'' He was equally critical of what he considered the overhyping of books, of book awards in the United States, of the state of book reviewing and of what giant bookstore chains were doing to the marketing of books. ''Most publishers seem like wallpaper,'' he told Publishers Weekly in 1977 in response to a question about his outspokenness and availability to the press. ''Most of them today are either promoted bookkeepers or ambitious men and women who care only for power and couldn't care less what they actually publish.'' He concluded, ''If publishers don't say much, it's probably because they don't have much to say.'' He often backed up his"

Hartnett, retired chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a principal force behind the mass marketing of Xerox copiers, died of a heart attack last Thursday at his home in Pittsford, N.Y. He was 79 years old. Mr. Hartnett retired as honorary chairman of the board of Xerox in 1965. He had joined the Haloid Company, forerunner of Xerox, in 1936 as assistant to the sales manager. In 1941 he became secretary and general sales manager of Haloid and in 1946 vice president in charge of sales and advertising. Shortly after that, the photographic process of xerography was introduced. In 1958 the name of the company was changed to Haloid Xerox Inc., and in 1961 it became simply the Xerox Corporation. Mr. Hartnett was made chairman of the board in 1958 and honorary chairman in 1960. Studied Forestry at Cornell He was born in Hornell, N.Y., and graduated from Cornell University, where he majored in forestry. At first Mr. Hartnett went to Memphis to join a lumber concern, but he returned to New York to become a full-time fund-raising agent for his alma mater's Cornellian Council. Later he worked as head of the lithographed stationery division of the Todd Company. In 1929 he was appointed to head sales and advertising for Graflex Inc. He also was with Eastman Kodak, which sent him across Africa in 1930 on a 4,000-mile trip by car to make travel films. Then Mr. Hartnett joined the Hughes, Wolff Advertising Company, where he was assigned to the Haloid account. After he was hired by the Haloid Company in 1936, it used him to help develop xerography. Making the Dictionary He once recalled thinking when a young scientist proposed the name for the process, ''My God, a word beginning with X, but the more we thought about it, the more we were ready to try it.'' ''And we got it into the dictionary.'' In 1953, while guiding Haloid's sales, Mr. Hartnett suffered his first heart attack. He had a second attack nine years later, but even after retirement, he remained active. He and his wife traveled around the world, stopping in Africa, the Soviet Union and Japan, among other places. He was active in community affairs, serving on an upstate zoning board and helping the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. When his schedule permitted, he liked to play nine holes of golf a day. The family maintained a summer home on Block Island, R.I., and spent several months each winter in Florida. Mr. Hartnett is survived by his wife, the former Mary Cullinan; a daughter, Nona White of Ithaca, N.Y.; a son, Sean Hartnett of Austin, Tex., and four grandchildren."
45807,"Jeffrey Zaslow, 53, Columnist and Author of 'The Last Lecture', Dies","Jeffrey Zaslow, a columnist and best-selling author whose books included chronicles of a dying professor's last lecture, a pilot who landed a crippled commercial airliner in the Hudson River and Representative Gabrielle Giffords's recovery from wounds in a horrific shooting in Arizona, died on Friday in a car accident in northern Michigan.","Jeffrey Zaslow, a columnist and best-selling author whose books included chronicles of a dying professor's last lecture, a pilot who landed a crippled commercial airliner in the Hudson River and Representative Gabrielle Giffords's recovery from wounds in a horrific shooting in Arizona, died on Friday in a car accident in northern Michigan. He was 53. The police said Mr. Zaslow's car was struck by a semi-trailer truck after he had lost control of his vehicle on a snow-covered road near Elmira. No charges had been filed, the police said, but an investigation was under way. Mr. Zaslow had attended a bookstore event in Petoskey, Mich., near Elmira, the night before, promoting his latest book, ''The Magic Room: A Story About the Love We Wish for Our Daughters.'' Published in December, the book was about the clientele of a long-established Michigan bridal shop. Mr. Zaslow was drawn to stories about people seeking meaning in their lives, often in the face of mortality. Some of his books were based on stories in his column ''Moving On'' in The Wall Street Journal. Besides Ms. Giffords, who recently left Congress to devote herself to her rehabilitation from the January 2011 shooting that also killed six people, Mr. Zaslow worked on books with Chesley B. Sullenberger III, the pilot who landed the jet in the Hudson in 2009; and Randy Pausch, the subject and co-author of ''The Last Lecture,'' which has sold more than five million copies. ''The Last Lecture'' began as a hunch. Professor Pausch had announced that he was dying and was planning to sum things up in a last lecture for his students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh in September 2007. Thinking it might make for a good column for The Journal, Mr. Zaslow, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, drove from his base in Detroit to hear what he would say. A tape of the 76-minute lecture Professor Pausch gave that day, ''Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams,'' became a sensation on YouTube. Mr. Zaslow and Professor Pausch teamed up to write a book based on it. The book, published shortly before Mr. Pausch died of pancreatic cancer in 2008, was a best seller in the hardcover advice and ''how to'' category in The New York Times for more than 100 weeks. Another book was born from a column about the stark differences between men and women in the way they conduct their lives after a divorce. (For one thing, women tend to keep their friends, he found; men, not so much.) The book, ''The Girls From Ames: A Story of Women and a 40-year Friendship,'' was based on an article suggested by one of the many women who wrote to compliment him on his column and to verify the phenomenon he described with the facts of their own lives. The newspaper article that probably had the greatest impact on Mr. Zaslow's own life was one he wrote in 1987 about a contest The Chicago Sun-Times was holding to fill the job left vacant when its advice columnist, Eppie Lederer (Ann Landers), de-camped for a competitor, The Chicago Tribune. Mr. Zaslow, who was then a feature writer for The Wall Street Journal, entered the contest for the fun of it. And he won. In an interview with The New York Times, he said some people thought he was underqualified. ''How could you have the audacity to give advice?,'' people scolded him, he said. ''My reply: 'I'm 28, but I have the wisdom of a 29-year-old.' '' He wrote the advice column, ''All That Zazz,'' until 2001. His annual singles party for charity, Zazz Bash, drew 7,000 readers a year and resulted in 78 marriages. Jeffrey Lloyd Zaslow was born on Oct. 6, 1958, in Philadelphia, one of the four children of Harry and Naomi Zaslow. His father was a real estate investor. After graduating from Carnegie Mellon in 1980, he worked for The Orlando Sentinel's Sunday magazine until 1983, then joined The Wall Street Journal as a feature writer. He returned to The Journal as a columnist in 2001. He is survived by his wife, Sherry Margolis, a news anchor for television station WJBK Fox 2 in Detroit; their three daughters, Jordan, Alexandra and Eden; his parents; a sister, Lisa Segelman, and two brothers, Darrell and Michael. Almost every book he wrote became a best seller, including his most recent, ''Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope,'' published at the end of last year. ''He was curious about everything, and interested in everything,'' Ms. Margolis said in an interview on Friday. ''And he knew what would make a good story.'' One of the few books that did not sell hugely, his first, was ''Tell Me All About It,'' based on his years as an advice columnist. In a newspaper column about the book, Mr. Zaslow summarized his approach to giving advice, and in the process gave a description of his journalism. ''So, I listen,'' he wrote. ''I try not to dwell on my inadequacies as an adviser. Instead, I tell myself that almost everyone has a story to tell, and sometimes, through the retelling, we can find answers.''"

33946,"Mollie Parnis, Designer, Dies in Her 90's","Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital.","Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age. She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman. Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem. Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities. In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called ""the President's house."" Simple Beginnings With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million. But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. ""The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing,"" she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York. Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born. Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. ""My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education,"" she once told Life magazine. ""I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."" Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. ""What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?"" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to ""Mollie's."" A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving ""Dress Up Your Neighborhood"" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem. After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press. ""She collected journalists all her life,"" he said. ""She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."" Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was ""close"" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with ""a life expectancy of five minutes."" She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour. A Desperate First Design She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. ""She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress,"" she said some seven decades later. ""I still remember it. Blue serge."" After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design. In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory. ""Well,"" Miss Parnis said, ""you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."" Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start. As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. ""Over the years,"" she once said, ""as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis."" That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. ""I've always had a theory,"" she told an interviewer, ""that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight."" A Brief Closing When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. ""Then,"" she said, ""I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."" Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world ""out there"" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue (""When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself""). Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. (""We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood."") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse. When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. ""Well, unbuy it,"" she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. ""Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money,"" he suggested. She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today. It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate. In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman. Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September."

Dudley, a retired New York judge and former borough president of Manhattan whose manifold career took him from civil rights advocacy to an ambassadorship in Africa, died on Tuesday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 93 and lived in Harlem. The cause was prostate cancer, his family said. He also was a teacher, a lawyer for the N.A.A.C.P., a Democratic county chairman and the first African-American to run for statewide office on a major-party ticket in New York. (He was the Democratic-Liberal candidate for attorney general in 1962 but was beaten by the incumbent Republican, Louis J. Lefkowitz.) Edward Richard Dudley was the son of a dentist in South Boston, Va. During his student years he worked as a bellhop, waiter and real estate clerk in an uncle's office, enrolling as a pre-dental student at Johnson C. Smith College in North Carolina and graduating in 1932 with a B.S. degree. He taught black children in a one-room school in Virginia and, as he recalled later, soon learned about discrimination in pay. His salary came to $60 a month. White teachers got $115. After a year at Howard University on a scholarship in dentistry, he moved north and became close to his politically connected uncle, Edward A. Johnson, a real estate developer. He worked odd jobs and signed on with a public works theater project, serving as stage manager for its unit director, the young Orson Welles. The experience may have led to the deep-voiced, deliberate and somewhat dramatic manner of speech of his later career. After the theater project ended in 1938, he enrolled in law school at St. John's University, received an L.L.B. in 1941 and went into private practice for a brief time. Encouraged by his family connection, he joined the Carver Democratic Club in Harlem. He became a precinct activist and got a job as an assistant state attorney general that ended when Thomas E. Dewey was elected governor in 1942. Mr. Dudley went to work for the growing Pepsi-Cola company, drumming up sales at Army camps. Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice, persuaded him to join the N.A.A.C.P. legal team in 1943. As an assistant special counsel, he wrote briefs and prepared cases seeking the admission of black students to Southern colleges, equal pay for black teachers and an end to discrimination in public transportation. He was executive assistant to the governor of the Virgin Islands from 1945 to 1947 and then spent five years as President Harry S. Truman's ambassador to Liberia. It was a key diplomatic post in Africa; he also helped oversee Truman's Point Four program of economic assistance for third world countries. Returning home in 1953, he practiced law and directed the N.A.A.C.P.'s Freedom Fund. In 1955, Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed him a justice on the Domestic Relations Court. He resigned in 1961 when he was elected by the City Council to serve as Manhattan borough president, after a fellow Harlemite, Hulan E. Jack, had to quit the position amid a conflict of interest scandal. Mr. Dudley served the remainder of Mr. Jack's term, and he won election to the post later that year. As borough president he made moderate-cost housing a priority, to keep the taxpaying middle class in the city. At the same time, he headed the New York County Democratic Committee. He left the borough presidency at the end of 1964 after winning election to a vacancy on the State Supreme Court. He was re-elected in 1978 and served past the usual retirement age, until 1985. Beginning in 1967, he was administrative judge of the Criminal Court of the City of New York. In 1970, he became administrative judge of State Supreme Court for Manhattan and the Bronx. Mr. Dudley is survived by his wife of 63 years, Rae Oley Dudley; a son, Edward R. Jr. of Scarsdale, N.Y.; two brothers, Dr. Calmeze Dudley of Los Angeles and Dr. Hubert Dudley of Chicago; and three grandchildren."

47952,"Milton Babbitt, a Composer Who Gloried in Complexity, Dies at 94","Milton Babbitt, an influential composer, theorist and teacher who wrote music that was intensely rational and for many listeners impenetrably abstruse, died on Saturday.","Milton Babbitt, an influential composer, theorist and teacher who wrote music that was intensely rational and for many listeners impenetrably abstruse, died on Saturday. He was 94 and lived in Princeton, N.J. Paul Lansky, a composer who studied with Mr. Babbitt and was a colleague at Princeton University, where Mr. Babbitt remained an emeritus professor of composition, said that Mr. Babbitt died at a hospital in Princeton. Mr. Babbitt, who had a lively sense of humor despite the reputation for severity that his music fostered, sometimes referred to himself as a maximalist to stress the musical and philosophical distance between his style and the simpler, more direct style of younger contemporaries like Philip Glass, Steve Reich and other Minimalist composers. It was an apt description. Although he dabbled early in his career with theater music, his Composition for Orchestra (1940) ushered in a structurally complex, profoundly organized style that was rooted in Arnold Schoenberg's serial method. But Mr. Babbitt expanded on Mr. Schoenberg's approach. In Mr. Schoenberg's system, a composer begins by arranging the 12 notes of the Western scale in a particular order called a tone row, or series, on which the work is based. Mr. Babbitt was the first to use this serial ordering not only with pitches but also with dynamics, timbre, duration, registration and other elements. His methods became the basis of the ''total serialism'' championed in the 1950s by Pierre Boulez, Luigi Nono and other European composers. Mr. Babbitt began exploring this path in Three Compositions for Piano (1947) and Composition for Four Instruments (1948), and adhered to it through his entire career. He composed prolifically for chamber ensembles and instrumental soloists and created a substantial and varied catalog of vocal works. He also composed a compact but vital group of orchestral pieces and an enduring series of works for synthesizer, often in combination with voices or acoustic instruments. Mr. Babbitt liked to give his pieces colorful titles, often with puns (''The Joy of More Sextets,'' for example), and said that in selecting titles he tried to avoid both the stale and the obscure. Yet when Mr. Babbitt explained his compositional approach in essays, lectures and program notes, they could be as difficult to understand as his music. In one program note, he spoke of ''models of similar, interval-preserving, registrally uninterpreted pitch-class and metrically durationally uninterpreted time-point aggregate arrays.'' He often said in interviews that every note in a contemporary composition should be so thoroughly justified that the alteration of a tone color or a dynamic would ruin the work's structure. And although colleagues who worked in atonal music objected when their music was described as cerebral or academic, Mr. Babbitt embraced both terms and came to be regarded as the standard-bearer of the ultrarational extreme in American composition. That reputation was based in part on an article published by High Fidelity magazine in February 1958 under the title ''Who Cares if You Listen?'' The headline was often cited as evidence of contemporary composers' disregard for the public's sensibilities, and Mr. Babbitt objected that it had been added by an editor, without his permission. But whatever his objections, the article did argue that contemporary composition was a business for specialists, on both the composing and listening end of the transaction, and that the general public's objections were irrelevant. ''Why refuse to recognize the possibility that contemporary music has reached a stage long since attained by other forms of activity?'' Mr. Babbitt wrote. ''The time has passed when the normally well-educated man without special preparation could understand the most advanced work in, for example, mathematics, philosophy and physics. Advanced music, to the extent that it reflects the knowledge and originality of the informed composer, scarcely can be expected to appear more intelligible than these arts and sciences to the person whose musical education usually has been even less extensive than his background in other fields.'' Listeners who overlooked Mr. Babbitt's philosophical abstractions and thorny analyses -- who simply sat back and listened, rather than trying to understand his harmonies and structural processes -- often discovered works of great expressive variety. These range from the intense emotionality of ''A Solo Requiem'' (1976) to the shimmering surfaces and eerie pictorialism of ''Philomel'' (1964) and the poetic flow of some of the solo piano works, which have the spirit of advanced jazz improvisations. Indeed, in his ''All Set'' (1957), for winds, brasses and percussion, he achieved a freely improvisatory feeling within an atonal harmonic context. Milton Byron Babbitt was born in Philadelphia on May 10, 1916, and grew up in Jackson, Miss. He began studying the violin when he was 4 but soon switched to clarinet and saxophone. Early in his life he was attracted to jazz and theater music. He was making his own arrangements of popular songs at 7, and when he was 13, he won a local songwriting contest. Although the music he went on to write rejected the easily assimilated tonal language of popular music, Mr. Babbitt retained a fondness for theater songs all his life and was said to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the style. ''If you know anybody who knows more popular music of the '20s or '30s than I do, I want to know who it is,'' he said in an Internet interview with the New Music Box in 2001. ''I grew up playing every kind of music in the world, and I know more pop music from the '20s and '30s, it's because of where I grew up. We had to imitate Jan Garber one night; we had to imitate Jean Goldkette the next night. We heard everything from the radio; we had to do it all by ear. We took down their arrangements; we stole their arrangements; we transcribed them, approximately. We played them for a country club dance one night and for a high school dance the next.'' In 1946, Mr. Babbitt tried his hand at a musical, a collaboration with Richard Koch and Richard S. Childs called ''Fabulous Voyage.'' The work was not produced, but in 1982 Mr. Babbitt published three of its songs, which showed a firm command of the idiom and considerable charm. But Mr. Babbitt set his course toward serious avant-garde composition in 1932, when he played through the scores of some Schoenberg piano music that an uncle had brought home from Europe. At the time, Mr. Babbitt was a 16-year-old philosophy student at the University of Pennsylvania. The next year he became a composition student of Marion Bauer and Philip James at New York University, and in 1935 he began studying privately with Roger Sessions. In 1938, Sessions invited Mr. Babbitt to join the Princeton composition faculty, and Mr. Babbitt succeeded him as the William Shubael Conant Professor of Music in 1965. Mr. Babbitt was also on the faculty of the Juilliard School, where he began teaching in 1973, as well as at the Salzburg Seminar in American Studies; the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood; the new-music academy at Darmstadt, Germany; and the New England Conservatory in Boston. A series of six lectures he gave at the University of Wisconsin was published as ''Words About Music'' in 1987. Mr. Babbitt's articles about music were published as ''The Collected Essays of Milton Babbitt'' by Princeton University Press in 2003. His students included Mario Davidovsky and John Eaton, who have followed essentially in Mr. Babbitt's atonal path (although Mr. Eaton later broke away), and the theater composer Stephen Sondheim. During World War II, Mr. Babbitt taught mathematics at Princeton and undertook secret research in Washington. He also evolved his extended form of serialism during these years. But immediately after the war he pursued a split musical path, exploring his rigorous serial style in his abstract concert works, on one hand, and completing ''Fabulous Voyage'' and a film score, ''Into the Good Ground'' (1949). In the 1950s Mr. Babbitt was hired as a consultant by RCA, which was developing the most sophisticated electronic-music instrument of the time, the Mark II synthesizer. The Mark II became the centerpiece of the new Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in 1959. Mr. Babbitt was one of the center's first directors, along with Sessions, Vladimir Ussachevsky and Otto Luening. Mr. Babbitt's earliest electronic pieces, Composition for Synthesizer (1961) and Ensembles for Synthesizer (1964), were as intensely organized as his instrumental music had been. Indeed, he saw the synthesizer as a kind of liberation from the physical limitations of living performers. ''The medium provides a kind of full satisfaction for the composer,'' he said in a 1969 interview with The New York Times. ''I love going to the studio with my work in my head, realizing it while I am there and walking out with the tape under my arm. I can then send it anywhere in the world, knowing exactly how it will sound.'' The early synthesizer pieces have become classics, but Mr. Babbitt quickly moved forward, writing works in which electronic soundtracks accompanied live performers. Particularly striking are the vocal works ''Vision and Prayer'' (1961) and ''Philomel,'' and ''Reflections'' (1975) for piano and tape. He stopped composing music with an electronic component in 1976, when the Columbia-Princeton studio was vandalized, and it was decided that restoring it would be too expensive. Many of Mr. Babbitt's works have been recorded, and he has always had the loyalty of performers willing to devote the effort required to render his music sensibly. Among his earliest champions were the soprano Bethany Beardslee, for whom he wrote many of his vocal works (''A Solo Requiem'' was written in memory of her husband, Godfrey Winham); the Juilliard String Quartet; the pianists Robert Miller and Robert Helps; the Contemporary Chamber Ensemble; and the Group for Contemporary Music. In the 1970s and 1980s, a generation of young instrumentalists inured to the complexities of contemporary music became eloquent champions of Mr. Babbitt's music . Among them are the pianists Robert Taub and the guitarist David Starobin, who have commissioned and recorded Mr. Babbitt's works. Mr. Babbitt's orchestral music is so exceedingly complex that both the New York Philharmonic, in 1969, and the Philadelphia Orchestra, in 1989, postponed premieres when the available rehearsal time proved insufficient. He did, however, have champions among top-flight conductors, the most notable being James Levine, who in 1967, as a 24-year-old fledgling conductor, led the premiere of Mr. Babbitt's ''Correspondences.'' Mr. Levine later recorded Mr. Babbitt's music with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and commissioned his Second Piano Concerto for the Met Orchestra and Mr. Taub in 1998. He regularly included Mr. Babbitt's chamber works on his Met Chamber Ensemble programs, and in 2004 Mr. Babbitt dedicated his Concerti for Orchestra to Mr. Levine and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which commissioned it. Mr. Babbitt received a special Pulitzer citation for his life's work in 1982, and in 1986 he was awarded a $300,000 MacArthur Fellowship. His earlier awards included the Joseph Bearns Prize from Columbia University, for his ''Music for the Mass'' in 1941; the New York Music Critics Circle Awards, for Composition for Four Instruments in 1949 and for ''Philomel'' in 1964; and the Creative Arts Award from Brandeis University in 1970. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1965. Mr. Babbitt's wife, Sylvia, died in 2005. He is survived by a daughter, Betty Anne Duggan, and two grandchildren, Julie and Adam. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."
4577,"Hal Laycoe, 75, N.H.L. Player Whose High Stick Led to Riot","Hal Laycoe, a National Hockey League defenseman, coach and general manager, died on Tuesday following surgery in Langley, British Columbia.","Hal Laycoe, a National Hockey League defenseman, coach and general manager, died on Tuesday following surgery in Langley, British Columbia. He was 75. Laycoe was remembered chiefly for an encounter in 1955 with the Canadiens' star Maurice Richard that led to Richard's suspension from the playoffs and a riot in downtown Montreal. Laycoe was one of the few N.H.L. players to wear eyeglasses while on the ice, but he did not shy away from contact while playing for the Rangers, Canadiens and Boston Bruins in an 11-season career ending in 1956. While on defense for the Rangers in March 1947, Laycoe was involved in one of hockey's wildest brawls, taking on the Canadiens' Leo Lamoureux at Madison Square Garden in one of four major fights highlighting a melee that cleared both benches. Laycoe was traded to Montreal after that season, then joined Boston during the 1950-51 season. On March 13, 1955, Laycoe was again involved in a confrontation with Montreal, this time while playing for the Bruins at Boston Garden. Now his opponent was Richard, the future Hall of Famer. Laycoe delivered a hard check to Richard late in the third period and cut him with a high stick. Richard, bleeding profusely from his face, smashed Laycoe on the shoulder with his stick, and when a linesman, Cliff Thompson, tried to pull Richard away, he punched the official. The N.H.L. commissioner, Clarence Campbell, suspended Richard for the last three games of the regular season and all of the playoffs. Laycoe was given a five-minute penalty. When Campbell attended the Canadiens' game with the Detroit Red Wings at the Montreal Forum four days later, he was pelted with vegetables and struck by a fan. After someone set off a smoke bomb following the first period, the game was forfeited to the Red Wings. A riot then erupted on St. Catherine Street outside the Forum, with windows broken, stores looted and rocks thrown at police officers, capping one of the most calamitous nights in league history. When the Bruins played at Montreal in the Stanley Cup semifinals a few days after that, Laycoe faced the Canadien fans' wrath. A teammate, Eddie Sandford, recalled: ""I drew Laycoe as my taxi teammate. When we got to the Forum, the police were waiting for us, and they escorted us into the building and to the dressing room past a bunch of angry fans. Then every time Laycoe came on the ice, the crowd booed him."" Laycoe, a native of Sutherland, Saskatchewan, retired after the 1955-56 season, having played in 531 regular-season games with 25 goals and 77 assists. He accumulated 292 penalty minutes, not an unusual amount for a defenseman despite those well-remembered fights. He coached Portland of the Western Hockey League to seven titles in nine years, then was named head coach of the N.H.L.'s Los Angeles Kings in 1969. He was replaced after the team started with a 5-18-1 record and became director of player personnel. Laycoe was named coach of the newly established Vancouver Canucks in 1970. He spent two years behind the bench, missing the playoffs each time, then served as the team's general manager in 1973-74. He coached the Dutch national team in 1976-77 and then was a special-assignment scout for the Islanders, concentrating on the Vancouver area and Europe.

Besides architectural anomaly, what all three buildings share is a builder, Melvyn Kaufman. Mr. Kaufman, a quixotic, unabashedly contentious developer who helped shape Manhattan's postwar streetscape and is credited with injecting his personal brand of whimsy into the city's office towers, died on March 18 at 87. His death, at his home in Mamaroneck, N.Y., was confirmed by his family. A longtime executive of the William Kaufman Organization, one of the city's most prominent family-owned development concerns, Mr. Kaufman erected half a dozen skyscrapers in Midtown (most along a stretch of Third Avenue from 44th to 49th Street), as well as several in the financial district. Though he was not an architect, his buildings were generally acknowledged to have sprung as much from his own vision as from the architect of record's -- a vision Mr. Kaufman realized with the aid of designers like Pamela Waters and Rudolph de Harak. The result was a singular combination of sleek modernism and Disneyesque ornamentation that might be described as International Style Fever Dream. Whether it was visionary or gimcrack was a question that long divided architecture critics. ''Kaufman was a romantic, a surrealist, a purveyor of kitsch and a genuine iconoclast and rebel,'' Carter B. Horsley, a former writer on architecture for The New York Times and The New York Post, said in a telephone interview on Friday. ''He was a maverick, and his rivals considered him something of an oddball, but they also respected the quality of his buildings.'' Mr. Kaufman had a lifelong fascination with office buildings as public spaces with which tenants and passers-by could engage. If one was going to erect a leviathan, his design philosophy seemed to go, at least make it leviathan with levity. He deplored lobbies, the sine qua non of office buildings since the dawn of recorded history. ''Marble and travertine mausoleums are bad for the living and terrific for the dead,'' Mr. Kaufman told The Times in 1971. Many of his buildings did away with traditional lobbies, employing set-back entrances from which wide public spaces extended to the street. These spaces were no mere plazas, but fields on which some of the buildings' most conspicuous design elements were played out. Consider 777 Third Avenue, a Kaufman building designed by the architect William Lescaze and opened in 1963. Its entrance plaza, between 48th and 49th Streets, features a huge, interactive pop-art sculpture by Theodore Ceraldi called ''Big Red Swing.'' Roughly the size and shape of a grand-piano lid, it can be sat upon, picnicked on and gently rocked, and on any fine day, amid the bustle of the avenue, there are people doing just that. In front of 747 Third (Emery Roth & Sons, 1972), the plaza, between 46th and 47th Streets, erupts into a series of brickwork hillocks. Topped with public benches, they suggest termite mounds as filtered through the surrealist vision of Antoni Gaudi. Mr. Kaufman's least lobbyesque lobby was at 127 John Street (Emery Roth, 1971), in Lower Manhattan. There, visitors entered through a long tunnel of corrugated steel, banded along its interior with hoops of bluish neon. Standing guard at the tunnel's entrance were two immense toy soldiers -- a tableau, Mr. Horsley said, ''that a visiting queen might appreciate.'' Nor did Mr. Kaufman neglect the backs of buildings, as his chessboard, a three-story-high affair with movable pieces, boldly attests. Mounted on a wall outside 767 Third Avenue (Fox & Fowle, 1980), the board is visible to tenants in the rear, as well as to passers-by on East 48th Street. On it, games -- often re-creations of historic matches -- are played out in slow sequence, with pieces moved weekly by a worker in a cherry picker. Other design elements were more covert -- unorthodox Easter eggs that Mr. Kaufman placed in his buildings for the benefit of those in the know. There is the nude woman at 747 Third, a sculpture tucked so discreetly into a space between the entranceway's two revolving doors that she can be glimpsed, fleetingly, only in midrevolution as one enters or leaves. The Sopwith Camel is invisible from the street. A World War I biplane, it sits -- or, more precisely, a life-size model of one sits -- atop 77 Water Street (Emery Roth, 1970), one of Mr. Kaufman's downtown buildings. He put it there, parked on a ''runway'' that lights up at night, he said, to spare tenants in surrounding office towers from having to look down upon water tanks and air-conditioning systems. Not all of Mr. Kaufman's innovations worked as intended. A life-size sculpture of him asleep on a love seat had to be removed from the open-air plaza outside 127 John Street, where he had installed it. It was so true to life that local residents kept calling the police to complain about a sleeping vagrant. But Mr. Kaufman's most outsize creation was very likely Mr. Kaufman -- not the sculpture but the man himself. His ardor for design was matched by ardor for argument: to call him combustible was by all accounts like calling Beethoven a pretty good tunesmith. He often found himself in court. In late 1969, Mr. Kaufman was arrested and charged with first-degree perjury in connection with an alleged attempt by an associate, Ralph Elyachar, to bribe a member of the City Planning Commission to block construction of a Midtown office tower by a competitor of Mr. Kaufman's. Mr. Elyachar and Mr. Kaufman pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of attempted perjury, a misdemeanor that carried no sentence. Far more often, however, Mr. Kaufman was on the complainant's side. In the 1980s, he sued New York City to try to recoup the cost of municipally mandated asbestos removal. (He lost.) In the late 1990s, he sued Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other officials over the city's erection of pedestrian barriers at certain intersections. (Ditto.) In the first decade of the 21st century, in a widely reported case, Mr. Kaufman sued several neighbors in Edgewater Point, the gated community in Mamaroneck in which he lived, over what he said were violations of the homeowners' association's covenant. The violations, he maintained, included a woman's allowing her parents to live in one of two houses she owned in the community. (This case was dismissed.) When court rulings did not go his way, Mr. Kaufman often appealed, twice to the United States Supreme Court, which declined to hear both cases. The son of William and Esther Diamond Kaufman, Melvyn Kaufman was born in New York City on Aug. 3, 1924, and reared there and in Great Neck, on Long Island. His father started the William Kaufman Organization the same year. After studies at several universities, including New York University -- ''none of them did me any good,'' he told an interviewer -- Melvyn Kaufman served with the Army infantry in Europe in World War II. After the war, he and his brother Robert joined the family business, with Robert handling finance and Melvyn overseeing design. Before his retirement, in 2010, Melvyn Kaufman was executive vice president of the William Kaufman Organization and president of its operating company, Sage Realty. Mr. Kaufman's first wife, the former Claire White, died in 1987. Survivors include their three daughters, Jerian Franco, Kim Kaufman and Karin Kaufman; his brother Robert; his second wife, Elizabeth H. Atwood; two stepchildren, Richard Metz Jr. and Jane Robinson; four grandchildren; and three step-grandchildren. The vagaries of time and real estate have left their mark on Mr. Kaufman's innovations. The hillocks outside 747 Third Avenue are scheduled to be replaced by a more level plaza, though the naked lady will remain. The neon tunnel at 127 John Street is long gone, a casualty of the building's conversion to a residential rental in the 1990s. Currently owned by Rockrose Development, the building is now known as 200 Water Street. There, rent runs to about $5,000 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. The capacious lobby is sheathed in hushed beige and cool marble."

She was 101 years old. Miss Harkavy was born in Estonia, and emigrated with her family to the United States around 1900. With the exception of the 1920's and early 30's, when she joined the many expatriate American artists living in Paris, she was a resident of New York City for most of her life. Many of her often oversized sculptures of heads or figures in stone, bronze and clay reflected her social and political concerns. One of her best-known creations, ''The Miners,'' is owned by the Museum of Modern Art. Her works were exhibited widely in the United States and Europe between the 1930's and 1960's, and several of her pieces are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad and the Pushkin Museum in Moscow. Her works were featured in a recent show at New York's ACA Gallery, commemorating the now-defunct New York Society of Women Artists. Miss Harkavy was among the founders of the group, which was devoted to avant-garde women artists. She also taught sculpture for many years in her penthouse studio at the Ansonia Hotel, and did many commissioned busts. Ms. Harkavy had no survivors."

1198,Ice',"Herb Brooks, who molded an unheralded collection of United States hockey players, most of them collegians, into the ""Miracle on Ice"" team that captured the gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics, died yesterday in an auto accident north of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.","Herb Brooks, who molded an unheralded collection of United States hockey players, most of them collegians, into the ""Miracle on Ice"" team that captured the gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics, died yesterday in an auto accident north of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Brooks, who lived in Birchwood Village, Minn., was 66. Brooks, according to witnesses, evidently lost control of his minivan on an interstate highway and was ejected from the vehicle after it rolled over, said Lt. Chuck Walerius, the supervisor at the scene for the Minnesota State Patrol. Walerius said there was no indication that alcohol was involved in the crash. Brooks was returning from a golf tournament in northern Minnesota that raised money for the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in Eveleth, Minn., its executive director, Tom Shersha, said in a televised interview. Brooks, who was inducted into the Hall in 1990, earned a special niche in American sports as the orchestrator of the 1980 Olympic team that stunned the Soviet Union, 4-3, then defeated Finland for the gold medal. In 1979, Brooks was coaching the University of Minnesota, where he had also played, when he was asked to put together a squad for the Lake Placid Games. The reigning world hockey power was the Soviet Union, whose team was composed of older players from military teams or clubs, and who performed together on a year-round basis. The United States had captured the 1960 gold medal, but its hockey program had been overtaken by many countries in the two decades after that. Brooks, who liked to describe himself as a street guy from St. Paul, knew he had to work with players who did not know one another and who came from rival hockey areas, New England and Minnesota for the most part. They would be together for less than a year when the Olympics began. But he made it work, in part because he made himself the focus of the players' animosity, playing the bad cop to his easygoing assistant, Craig Patrick. Brooks took Mike Eruzione, a smallish but spirited player from Boston University, and appointed him captain, to the surprise of many on the team. His No. 1 goalie was another Boston University player, Jim Craig. A week before the Olympics got under way, the Soviet squad trounced the American team in an exhibition game by 10-3. But Brooks had instituted an American style based on speed and motion away from the puck. Despite that loss, the club entered the Games at a physical peak. The Americans tied Sweden in their Olympic opener by scoring with only 27 seconds to play. Before the game with the Soviet Union, Brooks told his players, ""You were born to be here,"" and walked out of the locker room. The game was not televised live, but when word came of the victory, enthralled Americans watched the taped replay later in the evening. They heard the broadcaster Al Michaels, in what became a memorable call, exclaim, ""Do you believe in miracles?"" The upset victory provided a lift for America at a time when hostages were still being held in Iran and the end of the cold war was nowhere in sight. ""When it came to hockey he was ahead of his time,"" Ken Morrow, a defenseman on the 1980 Olympic team and now a scout for the Islanders, said yesterday. ""All of his teams overachieved because Herbie knew how to get the best out of each player and make him part of a team."" Lou Lamoriello, the Devils' president and general manager, said in a telephone interview that ""Herb opened the door for college players to get the opportunity to play in the National Hockey League."" He added: ""It was a closed door before the 1980 Winter Olympics. That year opened the door."" Brooks was the last player to be cut in tryouts for the 1960 United States gold-medal-winning team, then played on the American squads in 1964 and 1968. Having played hockey for the University of Minnesota, Brooks coached the team from 1971 to '79, capturing three national championships. Brooks later coached in the N.H.L., with the Rangers (1981-85), the Minnesota North Stars (1987-88), the Devils (1992-93) and the Pittsburgh Penguins (1999-2000). He coached the French team at the Nagano Olympics in 1998, coached the United States team to a silver medal at the Salt Lake City Olympics last year and was director of player development for the Penguins at the time of his death. Brooks is survived by his wife, Patti; a daughter, Kelly; and a son, Daniel."
