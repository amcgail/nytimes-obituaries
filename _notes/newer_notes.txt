OK

there are some improvements I can make.
I can put everything in a MongoDB database, with a running backup that I put somewhere in the cloud.
	this allows a very quick load-time, and I can still store lists &c,
	but I can also store lots more. e.g. versions of documents,
	and different datasources, easily (not all stupid pickled stuff)
right now I'm pulling from CSV & pickle files, separately. this is stupid.
I should be able to add documents, and code them, logging which algorithm coded them
	(can update algorithm codes with a decorator before the properties.
		so when I re-code using a new method I can update the version number.)

AND on a meta-level, I can store the code I used to generate exactly that.
AND be able to retrieve it from an obituary coding.
AND you can specify which versions of each

	NOTE for versioning, each method also calls a bunch of sub-methods, so it matters which version is used for ALL the properties, not just the one.
