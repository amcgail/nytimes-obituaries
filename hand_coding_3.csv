16410,"James Rachels, Ethicist, 62; Ignited Euthanasia Debate","Dr. James Rachels, a philosopher and medical ethicist who wrote some of the most influential works on euthanasia, arguing that the legal distinction between killing and passively allowing a patient's death had no rational basis, died on Friday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala.","Dr. James Rachels, a philosopher and medical ethicist who wrote some of the most influential works on euthanasia, arguing that the legal distinction between killing and passively allowing a patient's death had no rational basis, died on Friday at a hospital in Birmingham, Ala. He was 62. The cause was cancer, said his son Stuart. In 1975, Dr. Rachels's most widely debated article, ""Active and Passive Euthanasia,"" was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Euthanasia then was generally condemned and terminally ill patients rarely refused medical treatment. Dr. Rachels, who spent much of his career as a philosophy professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, broke ground by arguing that actively killing a patient with a terminal illness was no worse morally than letting the person die by doing nothing. If withholding treatment meant passive euthanasia for a patient near death, he wrote, then the patient might as well be killed by lethal injection or some other painless form of active euthanasia. Both methods led to humane deaths, he argued, and directly killing patients might save them from hours or even days of suffering. ""In the early 70's, the idea of refusing treatment was not generally accepted, and active euthanasia wasn't even a question,"" said Dr. Hugh LaFollette, a philosophy professor at Eastern Tennessee State University and a former colleague of Dr. Rachels's. ""He argued that if you buy the idea of turning off a respirator, then you should accept active euthanasia,"" Dr. LaFollette said. ""But in that climate it was completely radical. It was the first essay in the philosophical community that openly advocated active euthanasia."" The article put Dr. Rachels at the forefront of the euthanasia debate. Along with Dr. Peter Singer's 1975 book, ""Animal Liberation,"" the paper helped start an applied ethics movement in philosophy that focused on polarizing issues like abortion, animal rights, suicide and cloning. In 1991, in ""Created From Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism,"" Dr. Rachels argued that animals should not be treated inhumanely in experiments simply because they were less intelligent than humans. Dr. Rachels argued that the issue was not the animals' intelligence but their ability to suffer. Born in Columbus, Ga., in 1941, James Rachels earned his bachelor's degree from Mercer University and his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina. He taught at several schools, including Duke and New York University, before becoming chairman of the philosophy department at Birmingham, where he spent the last 26 years. He wrote 5 books and 85 essays. His 1971 textbook, ""Moral Problems,"" sold 100,000 copies over three editions and was a staple of many college philosophy courses. In addition to his son Stuart, of Birmingham, Dr. Rachels is survived by his wife, Carol; another son, David, of Lexington, Va.; two sisters, Cindy Withrow of Atlanta and Jean Holt of Columbus, Ga.; his parents, James and Velma Rachels of Columbus; and two grandsons."
8728,"Wardell Quezergue, 81, R&B Hitmaker","Wardell Quezergue, a prime mover in New Orleans rhythm and blues since the early 1950s as a producer, arranger and bandleader for a long list of artists including the Dixie Cups, Professor Longhair, the Neville Brothers and Dr. John, died on Tuesday in Metairie, La.","Wardell Quezergue, a prime mover in New Orleans rhythm and blues since the early 1950s as a producer, arranger and bandleader for a long list of artists including the Dixie Cups, Professor Longhair, the Neville Brothers and Dr. John, died on Tuesday in Metairie, La. He was 81. The cause was complications of congestive heart failure, his son Brian said. As a producer and arranger, Mr. Quezergue (pronounced ka-ZAIR) was associated with a string of local and national hits, many of them propelled by his punchy, syncopated horn arrangements. These included ''Big Chief'' by Professor Longhair, ''Iko Iko'' by the Dixie Cups, ''Barefootin' '' by Robert Parker, ''Groove Me'' by King Floyd, ''Mr. Big Stuff'' by Jean Knight and ''Misty Blue'' by Dorothy Moore. With the drummer Smokey Johnson, he wrote the 1964 instrumental ''It Ain't My Fault,'' a New Orleans song later sampled by Mariah Carey, the rapper Silkk the Shocker and others. ''He introduced a new sound, with a richer, fuller horn section, and funky rhythms,'' said John Broven, the author of ''Rhythm and Blues in New Orleans.'' ''It gave New Orleans music a whole new dimension.'' ''Groove Me'' and ''Mr. Big Stuff,'' recorded at the Malaco Records studios in Jackson, Miss., became Top 10 hits in the early 1970s and helped revive the flagging fortunes of the New Orleans sound. A variety of artists then flocked to Mr. Quezergue, including Paul Simon, who worked with him on the album ''There Goes Rhymin' Simon.'' He later worked as an arranger on the albums ''Fiyo on the Bayou'' for the Neville Brothers; ''Orchid in the Storm'' for Aaron Neville; ''Goin' Back to New Orleans'' for Dr. John; ''Deacon John's Jump Blues'' for Deacon John Moore; and two albums for the blues singer Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown, ''Gate Swings'' and ''American Music, Texas Style.'' ''If I hear something, immediately I start arranging,'' Mr. Quezergue told the NPR series ''American Roots'' in 2010. ''Arrangement, to me, has to be part of the song itself, as if the two were made for each other at the moment that the writer wrote the song, and it should fit like a glove.'' Wardell Joseph Quezergue was born on March 12, 1930, in New Orleans to a musical family. He took up the trumpet and while still in high school began writing arrangements. After leaving high school and enlisting in the Army, he continued to arrange for military bands while stationed in Tokyo. When his unit was sent to fight in Korea, he was held back to continue his arranging work. His replacement died in combat, inspiring Mr. Quezergue to write a classical composition, ''A Creole Mass,'' which he did not complete until 2000. After returning to New Orleans he formed the Royal Dukes of Rhythm with other ex-servicemen. The group became a fixture, performing at dances and serving as the house band for visiting musical acts. The bandleader Dave Bartholomew hired him as an arranger for Imperial Records, where he worked with artists like Fats Domino and Earl King and recorded with his own band, Wardell and the Sultans. At Nola Records, which he helped found in 1964, Mr. Quezergue produced singles for local stars like Willie Tee and Eddie Bo. But despite national chart successes like ''Barefootin,' '' a Top 10 hit in 1966, the label went out of business in 1968. He struck a deal with Malaco Records to supply artists and his production skills in return for studio time and session musicians. Driving a group of singers to the studio in a borrowed schoolbus, he presided over a marathon recording session in 1970 that yielded ''Groove Me'' and ''Mr. Big Stuff,'' both of which Atlantic and Stax Records turned down. Released on Malaco's newly created Chimneyville subsidiary, ''Groove Me'' took off and, after being picked up by a chastened Atlantic, rose to the top of the rhythm-and-blues charts. Stax, in a similar turnaround, decided to distribute ''Mr. Big Stuff,'' which also rose to the top of the R&B charts and reached No. 2 on the pop charts. ''Wardell delivered those hits at a time when New Orleans really needed them,'' Mr. Broven said. ''The city's music scene was dead, but the symbolism of those hits gave New Orleans the impetus to get going again.'' In addition to his son Brian, Mr. Quezergue is survived by four other sons, Donald, Wayne, Victor and Martin; eight daughters, Violetta Johnson, Gaynelle Mitchell, and Iris, Diana, Yoshi, Helen, Ramona and Lesley Quezergue; a brother, Leo; and many grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren. His wife of 60 years, the former Yoshi Tamaki, died this year. In 2009 he released his own album, ''Music for Children Ages 3 to 103: The St. Agnes Sessions.''"

He was 62. The cause was pneumonia associated with Lou Gehrig's disease, CUNY said. At the CUNY Graduate Center, which he joined in 1985 as associate provost and dean for academic affairs, he was chairman of the building advisory committee for the initial planning for the center's move last year to the B. Altman building at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. As provost, from 1994 to 1998, Dr. Marshall was also responsible for interviewing prospective faculty members for the graduate center, an assignment he said he loved. Frances Degen Horowitz, the president of the graduate center, said, ""He was very concerned about having quality faculty who represented the spectrum of attitudes and opinions."" She said that Dr. Marshall had helped draw scholars as varied as John Patrick Diggins, a conservative historian, and Talal Asad, a liberal anthropologist. As a top officer of the endowment for the humanities, he also helped bridge the transition from its direction by Joseph D. Duffey, a noted liberal, to William J. Bennett, a noted conservative, who became chairman in 1981. Geoffrey Marshall was born in Lancaster, Pa., and attended Franklin and Marshall College. He earned his Ph.D. in English from Rice University. A scholar who specialized in 17th century literature and Restoration drama, he began his career as an administrator as an assistant provost at the University of Oklahoma. He left the job in 1974 to work with the National Endowment for the Humanities, where he was director of the state programs and education programs divisions before becoming deputy director. Dr. Marshall is survived by his wife, Mary; his mother, Mary E. Marshall of Norman, Okla.; a brother, Tony Marshall, of Manhattan; a sister, Terry Marshall, of Norman, Okla.; two daughters, Eden Marshall Hagelman of San Marcos, Tex., and Erin Marshall Lancer of Buffalo; and four grandchildren. http://www.nytimes.com"

He was 80. Mr. Waldrop was born on Sept. 2, 1919, on a ranch just north of Abilene, Tex. He received a Bachelor of Music degree from Baylor University in Waco, Tex., and then served in the intelligence division of the Air Force during World War II, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star. After the war, Mr. Waldrop briefly taught at Baylor and conducted the Baylor University-Waco Symphony. He then entered the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where he received his master's and doctoral degrees in composition, studying with Howard Hansen and Bernard Rogers. During the 1950's he was the editor of the Review of Recorded Music as well as the Musical Courier, and also served as a music consultant to the Ford Foundation. This work led him into the administrative field. In 1960 he became the assistant to the president at Juilliard and the next year was appointed dean. He was at that post in 1969 when the school moved from its old building on Claremont Avenue in Morningside Heights into its new $30 million building at Lincoln Center, which he described in an interview at the time as ""the Taj Mahal of conservatories."" In fact, as the school grew the building seemed increasingly crowded. Following the death in 1983 of the Juilliard School's president, the composer Peter Mennin, Mr. Waldrop served as the acting president for one year. From 1986 until 1989 he was the president of the Manhattan School, which had taken over the old Juilliard building on Claremont Avenue. Mr. Waldrop resigned this post over disagreements with the board. He is survived by a brother, Samuel. http://www.nytimes.com"
34313,"Bill Robinson, 64, a Coach And Player for Series Winners","Bill Robinson, a longtime outfielder who played on the Pittsburgh Pirates' 1979 World Series champions and was the batting coach for World Series winners with the Mets and Florida Marlins, died Sunday in Las Vegas.","Bill Robinson, a longtime outfielder who played on the Pittsburgh Pirates' 1979 World Series champions and was the batting coach for World Series winners with the Mets and Florida Marlins, died Sunday in Las Vegas. He was 64. Robinson, the minor league hitting coordinator for the Los Angeles Dodgers, was found dead in his hotel room while visiting the team's Pacific Coast League farm club, Josh Rawitch, a spokesman for the Dodgers, told The Associated Press. He said the cause of death was not immediately known. Robinson was envisioned as a future star when the Yankees obtained him in November 1966 from the Atlanta Braves for the sharp-fielding third baseman Clete Boyer. He was even referred to at times as ''a new Mickey Mantle.'' But he was hampered by injuries and never fulfilled his promise in three seasons with the Yankees. He played for the Phillies in the early 1970s, then had his most notable success with the Pirates from 1975 to 1982, twice hitting .300. Playing in a lineup that included Willie Stargell and Dave Parker, Robinson hit 24 home runs for the team that won the 1979 World Series, defeating the Baltimore Orioles in seven games. Robinson hit 166 home runs and had a career batting average of .258 in 16 major league seasons. He was the batting coach for the Mets from 1984 to 1989, providing pointers for the 1986 championship team that included Gary Carter, Keith Hernandez, Mookie Wilson and Darryl Strawberry, the talented but often undisciplined slugger, who became a special project for Robinson. Robinson and another coach, Sam Perlozzo, were fired by the general manager, Frank Cashen, after the '89 season over the objections of Manager Davey Johnson, whose own job had been in jeopardy. Robinson was later a batting coach in the Yankees' minor league system, then tutored hitters for the Marlins for four seasons, including their World Series-winning 2003 team. He had hoped to become a major league manager and managed in the Caribbean and the minor leagues to prepare, but he never received the opportunity. At times, he expressed concern that racial considerations might have hurt him. ''You're seeing new guys as managers these days,'' Robinson told The New York Times in 1987. ''Tom Kelly, Tom Trebelhorn, Jim Leyland. But you don't see any new younger blacks as managers.'' Robinson is survived by his wife, Mary Alice; a son, William III; a daughter, Kelley Ann; and three grandchildren. As a batting instructor, Robinson was reluctant to impose a particular technique on major leaguers. ''A good hitting instructor is able to mold his teachings to the individual,'' he once said. ''If a guy stands on his head, you perfect that.''"

He was 72 and had lived in Bonn since his return from Washington and retirement. He suffered a brief illness, his family said. Mr. van Well took charge of his country's Embassy in Washington after three years as representative of the Federal Republic at the United Nations. His most trying moments as Bonn's chief spokesman in the United States arose from a gesture billed by the conservative leaders of the two countries as the ultimate symbol of American-German reconciliation. Just over a year after Mr. van Well took up his post, President Ronald Reagan and Chancellor Helmut Kohl met at a German military cemetery in the small town of Bitburg. The event became an embarrassment when it turned out that among the 2,000 graves were those of 49 soldiers of the Waffen SS, the elite Nazi Party military organization. Many Jewish groups, veterans organizations and a majority of the House of Representatives protested, writing that the visit would have ""the unintended effect of reopening painful wounds in the United States."" Mr. Reagan and Mr. Kohl nevertheless kept to their agenda for that May day in 1985, and it was largely left to Mr. van Well to calm the ensuing outcry. Later that month he became the first West German official to be invited to address B'nai B'rith International, mostly because of Bitburg. He urged renewed efforts to build bridges between his country and American Jews. By all accounts his reception was cordial and his hosts considered the invitation a step toward that end after the setback of Bitburg. Mr. van Well was born in the town of Osterath, near Krefeld. He was a graduate of Bonn University in economics and of the Diplomatic School in Bonn. He entered the Federal Foreign Office in 1952 as an attache. Service at U.N. in 1950's He was posted to the West German Mission at the United Nations from 1954 to 1959, during which time, as Second Secretary, he married Carolyn Stevens Bradley of Short Hills, N.J. His career then took him back to Bonn, to Harvard University for advanced studies, to Tokyo and once again to the Foreign Office in Bonn, where he rose to Director General for Political for Political Affairs and State Secretary. He took the post at the United Nations in 1981.

35228,"Birgit Akesson, 93, Creator Of Elemental Dance Solos","Birgit Akesson, a dancer and choreographer whose unconventional approach to movement and music made her a prominent pioneer of Swedish modern dance, died on Saturday in Stockholm, where she lived.","Birgit Akesson, a dancer and choreographer whose unconventional approach to movement and music made her a prominent pioneer of Swedish modern dance, died on Saturday in Stockholm, where she lived. She died on her 93rd birthday. Unlike most modern dancers in the United States and Europe in the 1930's and 40's, Ms. Akesson was less concerned with expressing emotion than with finding the essence of dance through form. She rebelled early against her Expressionist training and became known for pure and rigorous solos, often performed without music. Although she stopped dancing in 1965, Ms. Akesson's role as a founding mother of Swedish modern dance was increasingly recognized in the last 30 years, and she was awarded the gold medal of the Swedish Academy in 1998. Her works were seen on Swedish television, and her pure-dance aesthetic found favor with a new generation of viewers. A founder of the Choreographic Institute in Stockholm, she was an expert on dance in Asia and also Africa, where she sought the roots of a dance culture absent in the West. In the 1950's she choreographed several works for the Royal Swedish Ballet as well as a space age opera, ""Aniara,"" that was typical of her collaboration with Sweden's modernist composers and poets. Yet her signature style was not dramatic and narrative. Ahead of her time, she sometimes baffled the international dance world with experiments in stillness, a dissociation between music and movement and her uncanny ability to reshape the body into an assemblage of independent planes. In Paris, where she had made her debut in 1934, this reconfiguring of the body reminded critics of Cubist forms, and Ms. Akesson was called ""the Picasso of Dance."" American audiences saw her perform in New York (1949 and 1955), and at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival (1955) and the American Dance Festival (1956). Referring to the slow pace or static quality of some of her solos, the American critic George Beiswanger wrote that she would occasionally ""crawl and writhe like a slug or an upended caterpillar, hardly moving at all."" But he added, ""If one lets the movement have its way, it generates a compelling, almost hypnotic beauty."" Ms. Akesson was born in Malmo, Sweden. From 1929 to 1931, she studied in Dresden at the school of Mary Wigman, the German modern dance pioneer. Although she and Birgit Cullberg, who was considered the other founding mother of Swedish modern dance, had their roots in German Expressionist dance, Ms. Akesson did not share Ms. Cullberg's interest in ballet or dance-drama. In search of her own dance idiom and what she called a first or primary movement that did not depend on music, she moved to Paris, where she presented a solo concert in 1934. Two years later she opened a school in Stockholm, where she concentrated on developing an idiom that would allow each part of the body to move independently. ""All parts of her dancing body were granted equal importance,"" Horace Engdahl wrote in ""Swedish Ballet and Dance"" (Swedish Institute, 1992). ""This was coupled with a new idea of space as growing out of the movement instead of being a fixed theatrical frame."" He added that the body ""seemed to be taken apart and reassembled in forever new shapes, dissolving into a continuous flow of images growing one out of the other."" Molding herself into a sculptural shape with her head or shoulder sometimes resting on the floor, Ms. Akesson often danced with eyes closed. In 1946 she returned to performing with two solos that were considered an artistic breakthrough, ""Blue Evening"" and ""Movement."" Ms. Akesson began to collaborate with the poet Erik Lindegren and the composer Karl-Birger Blomdahl in works like ""Eye: Sleep in Dream"" (1953). Mr. Lindegren's poem was heard before Ms. Akesson moved in silence, with the music played during blackouts between the danced passages. Ms. Akesson often turned to the same collaborators for the seven large works, beginning with the 1957 ""Sisyphus,"" that she choreographed for the Royal Swedish Ballet. In 1983 she published her highly acclaimed book on African culture, ""The Mask of Spring Water,"" and suddenly returned to choreography in 1989 by creating two solos on television. Long interested in Asian dance, she chose the Chinese-born dancer Chiang Ching to perform both dances, ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""Shades."" Ms. Akesson is survived by a daughter, Mona Moeller-Nilesen, and a grandchild."

Pigford, an independent-minded nuclear engineer who was recruited by the federal government for his advice on major nuclear accidents and nuclear waste, died Saturday at his home in Oakland, Calif.. He was 87. His death was confirmed by the nuclear engineering department at the University of California, Berkeley, of which he was the first chairman. Dr. Pigford had been treated for Parkinson's disease for nine years, his wife, Elizabeth Pigford, said. In 1979 he was a member of the commission that investigated the accident at the Three Mile Island reactor, near Harrisburg, Pa. The panel found that poorly trained operators had turned off key safety systems, allowing a simple malfunction to grow into a harrowing accident that reduced the nuclear core to rubble. Dr. Pigford, who was often pointed and even discordant in his views, was highly critical of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which he said had made technical errors and been unduly alarmist during the accident. He also maintained that his panel's findings were limited and should not be used to form a general indictment of nuclear power plants. ''Every technology imposes a finite degree of risk upon society, both in its routine operation and in the occurrence of accidents,'' he wrote. ''The essential question is the trade-off between the risks and the benefits. The commission neither received any evidence nor reached any conclusions that the risks of nuclear power outweigh its benefits.'' Seven years later, when the Soviet-designed reactor in Chernobyl, Ukraine, exploded and sent a cloud of radioactive material over Europe, he was appointed by the secretary of energy to a committee to evaluate the accident and the safety of a similar reactor operated by the department in Hanford, Wash. Dr. Pigford said that the American plant, which was used to make plutonium for nuclear bombs, was far more dangerous than American commercial reactors, and that one safety measure proposed by the department would be no help at all. Soon after, the department closed the reactor. In the mid-1990s, he also served on an Environmental Protection Agency panel that advised on what the standards should be for a nuclear repository then under consideration at Yucca Mountain, Nev. (The Energy Department said last month that it would kill the project.) The E.P.A. panel advised that standards for the waste dump should allow only very small radiation exposures to future generations. But to Dr. Pigford's dissatisfaction, the panel also said the government should be able to make assumptions about how land in the area would be used in future millenniums, a major factor in determining radiation exposure. The E.P.A. had assumed that water that had passed through the repository and picked up contaminants would be used by farm families to irrigate their crops and grow their own food, creating a pathway for exposure. But the panel advised that the agency should be allowed to assume that contaminated water from the site would not be used by subsistence farmers. The effect would be to permit higher levels of contamination. Dr. Pigford complained about the advisory panel's approach. ''They end up with such a less stringent result that cannot be defended,'' he said. ''That's bad for the project; it's bad for the country.'' Thomas Harrington Pigford was born on April 21, 1922, in Meridian, Miss., to Lamar and Zula Pigford. He graduated magna cum laude from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1943, served in the Navy in World War II, and was asked by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to join the faculty while still completing his doctorate there, his wife said. Before going to Berkeley, Dr. Pigford helped establish the nuclear engineering department at M.I.T. A chemical engineer, Dr. Pigford helped develop the process used by the government for years to harvest plutonium for bombs from irradiated reactor fuel. He was a co-author of ''Nuclear Chemical Engineering,'' published in 1958, revised in 1983 and considered the first text in the field. Dr. Pigford's first wife, the former Catherine Kennedy Cathey, died in 1992. Besides his wife, the former Elizabeth Hood Weekes, who is known as Betty and whom he married in 1994, Dr. Pigford is survived by two daughters, Cynthia Pigford Naylor, of Durham, Calif., and Julie Pigford Earnest, of Portland, Ore.; two stepdaughters, Janvrin Deler, of Dedham, Mass., and Laura Weekes, of Los Angeles; five grandchildren; and one great-grandson. One of Dr. Pigford's most memorable projects was perhaps the least successful: a cold war effort to develop a reactor to power an airplane. ''It had worlds of engineering problems, and they were all fun to work on,'' Dr. Pigford said in an oral history published in 1999. But he acknowledged that the project was allowed to continue for too long. ''You see,'' he said, ''the trouble is, the Air Force was the one who made the decisions and managed the money, and it fell in love with almost anything nuclear.''"

The cause was cancer, said Jane Rosenthal, a friend. She was 51. After Mr. Leno took over ""Tonight"" in May 1992, the show received an avalanche of criticism and ratings began to fall. In late September, NBC executives dismissed Ms. Kushnick after she was accused of demanding that guests booked by ""Tonight"" not appear on rival talk shows. Ms. Kushnick, whose maiden name was Gorman, grew up in Harlem. Her first job was as secretary to the producer David Gerber at 20th Century Fox in New York. She moved to Hollywood with Mr. Gerber and eventually found work at International Creative Management, the talent agency, where she rose from secretary to agent. In the mid-1970's, she formed a partnership with her husband, Jerrold Kushnick, an entertainment lawyer, and established herself as a manager. Her clients included Mr. Leno, whom she spotted in 1975 at the Comedy Store, Elayne Boosler, Jimmie Walker and for a brief period David Letterman. Ms. Kushnick's role in Mr. Leno's rise to host of ""The Tonight Show"" was chronicled in ""The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno and the Network Battle for the Night,"" by Bill Carter, a television reporter for The New York Times. In an HBO movie based on the book, the role of Ms. Kushnick was played by Kathy Bates. Ms. Kushnick, contesting Mr. Carter's version of events, filed a lawsuit for libel, which was settled out of court. Mr. Kushnick died of cancer seven years ago. The couple had twins, one of whom, Samuel, became infected with the virus that causes AIDS during a blood transfusion and died at age 3 in 1983. Ms. Kushnick became a campaigner in the fight against the disease. Ms. Kushnick is survived by a daughter, Sara Rose (the other twin), and a brother, Joseph Gorman, of New York City."
50247,"Errie Ball, 103; Played in First Masters","It was late March 1934, a spring Sunday in Augusta, Ga., the last round of the first Masters golf tournament.","It was late March 1934, a spring Sunday in Augusta, Ga., the last round of the first Masters golf tournament. Errie Ball stood on the edge of the third green. He had traveled farther than most to get there. He was a Welshman whose great-uncle, John Ball, had won the Open Championship in England in 1890 with a deliberately minimal set of clubs. None of those newfangled niblicks for him. In 1926, Errie Ball was playing in the Open as a 15-year-old amateur when he saw the sweet swing of one of the United States' most dazzling players, Bobby Jones. Eight years later, after Jones had helped him find work in the United States and membership in the Professional Golfers Association, Ball attended the new tournament in Georgia that Jones had co-founded. The Augusta National Invitational Tournament, it was called at the time. Ball, who was 103 when he died on July 2 in Stuart, Fla., was the last survivor of the 72 players in that first Masters. He also held another distinction: After he competed in 1934, 23 years passed before he played in the tournament again -- tied for the longest stretch between appearances. In the first Masters, Ball began the final day in respectable position, 11 off the lead and a stroke behind Jones, who was playing only recreationally by then. Ball was even for the day when his tee shot reached the green on the par-3 third hole. If he could make the 15-foot putt, he would have a birdie -- and improve his chances of receiving an invitation to return the next year. He five-putted instead, and his round fell apart. ''I blew it,'' he once said. ''Shot 86.'' It was the highest score of the week. He finished the tournament 25 strokes behind the winner, Horton Smith, and 15 behind Jones. In 1957, Ball scored 75 and 78 in the first two rounds, missing the cut. He received invitations to play in later years but always declined. ''I prefer to remember it the way it was when I was there,'' he said. Samuel Henry Ball was born on Nov. 14, 1910, in Bangor, Wales. He was given the nickname Errie (pronounced Airy) by a French maid who cared for him when he was a boy and struggled to pronounce Henry. His father, William Henry, was the professional at Lancaster Golf Club in England, and many of his uncles and cousins were club professionals. Errie learned the game quickly and turned professional at 17. He met Jones at the Open in 1930, four years after first watching him play. That year one of his uncles, Frank Ball, the professional at East Lake Country Club in Atlanta, of which Jones was a member, encouraged him to move to the United States. By 1931 he was working as an assistant to his uncle at East Lake. Although he had little luck at the Masters, he had plenty of success elsewhere. He won the Southeastern P.G.A. title several times in the 1930s, the Atlanta Open in 1932, the Virginia Open in 1936 and the Illinois Open in 1953, among others. He qualified for 20 United States Open championships and 12 P.G.A. Championships. He also played senior tournaments, but he spent most of his career teaching others as a club professional. He spent nearly 25 years at Oak Park Country Club outside Chicago and 20 winter golf seasons at Tucson Country Club in Arizona. He also worked in Florida, where he gave lessons in recent years as the emeritus professional at Willoughby Golf Club in Stuart. In 2011, he was elected to the P.G.A. Hall of Fame, 80 years after becoming a P.G.A. member. His daughter, Leslie Adams Gogarty, confirmed his death. Besides her, his survivors include his wife of 77 years, the former Maxie Wright, whom he met in 1936 while sailing from England to the United States and married two months later; two granddaughters; a great-grandson; and two brothers, Tom and John. Ball bridged much of golf's history. He saw Harry Vardon, who won six Open Championships beginning in 1896, play in person. Years later, he was paired with players like Ben Hogan, Byron Nelson and Sam Snead. But he may have been best known for his patience as a teacher, and for his good humor. At a party celebrating Ball's 100th birthday, in 2010, Bill Erfurth, one of his former assistants at Oak Park, recalled a time when Ball signed up for a lesson at a local driving range without revealing his identity, according to an article in Golfweek. Ball pretended to struggle on his first few shots before making a point of paying attention to what the resident instructor was trying to teach him. By the end of the 30-minute lesson, Ball was striking the ball with his usual authority. ''This young pro was beside himself,'' Erfurth recalled. ''He thought he'd performed a miracle.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

He was 82 and lived in Albany. The cause was cancer, said his brother, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., the novelist. Dr. Vonnegut was a distinguished professor emeritus of atmospheric sciences at the State University of New York at Albany. Although he formally retired in 1985, he continued to work in his office at the university until earlier this year. His expertise in meteorological phenomena ran the gamut from lighting bolts to tornadoes to updrafts and downdrafts in thunderstorms. He developed and explored theories about the role electrical charges play in the formation of precipitation as well as in tornadoes. Dr. Vonnegut was working at the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady when the technique of cloud seeding took flight in the 1940's. A colleague, Vincent J. Schaefer, discovered that a tiny grain of dry ice produced many millions of ice crystals when dropped into a cloud of water droplets below the freezing point. Dr. Vonnegut soon established that silver iodide got better results in nucleating clouds than did dry ice. Since then, no other nucleating process has been found that would rival theirs for making rain efficiently. Commercial rainmakers use the method today to control drought in parts of the western United States, Australia and elsewhere. But weather modification can also bring litigation. Rainmaking companies, meteorologists say, must move cautiously for fear of lawsuits from people downwind, whose rain is being ambushed, or from others complaining of flood conditions. Dr. Vonnegut earlier teamed up with Dr. Schaefer and Irving Langmuir, the G.E. Nobelist, in a project for the Army Signal Corps, attempting to turn fog and clouds into rain and clearing overcast skies. He was born in Indianapolis, graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1936, and received his Ph.D. in physical chemistry there three years later. He worked for industrial laboratories and at M.I.T. before joining the G.E. labs in 1945. In addition to his brother, Dr. Vonnegut is survived by five sons, Peter, of Albany, Scott, of Bennington, Vt., Terrence and Kurt, both of Albany, and Alex, of Cohoes, N.Y.; and five grandchildren. His wife, Lois Bowler Vonnegut, died in 1972."

He was 76 years old. His death was announced by the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, of which he was senior vice president and chief scientist until he retired in 1975. His career spanned nearly half a century, beginning in 1928 when he joined the company's Paris laboratories as an electrical engineer. After coming to this country early in World War II, Dr. Busignies helped organize and headed the domestic research arm of I.T.T., Federal Communications Laboratories, now the I.T.T. Laboratories Division, in Nutley, N.J. Dr. Busignies' original work included instrument-landing systems, which make busy air lanes safe for pilots and passengers. He also originated the Tactical Air Navigation, which guides military aircraft of the United States and its allies overseas. Invention Aided Allies An earlier invention, known as ''Huff-Duff,'' a High-Frequency Direction Finder, was spirited out of Occupied France in 1940 by Dr. Busignies. Developed for I.T.T. in Paris, it pinpointed the source of radio transmissions in seconds, helping to thwart the wolf packs of German submarines, which caused heavy losses to Allied convoys. The Navy cited Dr. Busignies for his contributions to the war effort, as did the White House with a Presidential certificate of Merit, just two of many honors to be bestowed on him over the years. Dr. Busignies was born in Sceaux, in suburban Paris, the son of a mechanical engineer. He received a patent for a radio compass even before he earned his degree in electrical engineering in Paris. For 12 years at the I.T.T. laboratory in Paris, he developed radio direction finders and worked on aircraft radio navigation systems and early radar. Germans Discover Mission The work was militarily sensitive, and I.T.T. decided to bring its top French scientists to this country when a German colonel discovered the real nature of Dr. Busignies' research behind a civilian front. He and two of his colleagues managed to reach America by a circuitous route and to smuggle out records, drawings and components vital to the Allied cause. He remained in this country after the war and quickly rose in the I.T.T. structure, becoming vice president and general technical director in 1960. The titles of senior vice president and chief scientist were added in the following years. On retirement, he was honored with emeritus rank and kept abreast of the scientific work done by the company. Dr. Busignies is survived by his wife, the former Cecile Phaeton, a daughter, Monique Stolz, and two grandchildren."

He was 86 and lived in Bournemouth. He suffered a severe stroke last month and never recovered, said Dr. Geoffrey Burbidge, an astrophysicist at the University of California at San Diego who had collaborated with Dr. Hoyle on many research projects. ""Fred was probably the most creative and original person in astrophysics after World War II,"" Dr. Burbidge said. Dr. Virginia Trimble, an astrophysicist at the University of California at Irvine, said that Dr. Hoyle's opposition to the Big Bang, while considered a mistake, ""was significant in that it went a long way toward making cosmology a true science"" in which competing theories were tested by observations. -------------------- A Cosmic Rebel By WALTER SULLIVAN A versatile scientist brimming with ideas and a lifelong rebel eager for intellectual combat, Dr. Hoyle was most widely known as an author of the cosmological theory, which now has few adherents, that the universe exists in a steady state. The theory, published in 1948, contends that matter is constantly being created, so the expanding universe remains roughly the same at all times and has no beginning or end. In a series of popular radio talks in Britain in the 1940's, he coined ""big bang"" to ridicule the rival concept of an explosive origin of the universe, but the term is now widely used and the explosion theory is generally accepted. In recent years Sir Fred joined those arguing for a universe that -- while eternal -- expands and contracts. The astronomer was instrumental in establishing the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy at the University of Cambridge in England and became its first director. From 1958 to 1972 he was also Plumian professor of astronomy at the university, a post previously held by such leading scientists as Sir Arthur Eddington, whose groundbreaking experiments confirmed the general theory of relativity. A historic development in astrophysics was explaining how the elements came to be synthesized step by step in the stars, starting from hydrogen and helium. In the 1930's, Dr. Hans Bethe and others showed how stars could derive their energy from the fusion of hydrogen nuclei (protons) to form helium. The problem Dr. Hoyle and colleagues faced was how slightly larger elements like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen were formed by stars. An element called beryllium-8, which was an intermediate stage in the process of element formation, stood in the way. It did not survive long enough for the fusion process to reach carbon-12, the next stage in the element building process. Dr. Hoyle solved the problem: he pressed nuclear physicists to look for a special state of carbon-12, that was stable enough for the fusion of heavier elements to occur. Then, working with three other scientists, Dr. Hoyle figured out how all the heavier elements could have been formed. Their historic paper was published in 1957 in Reviews of Modern Physics. In addition to Dr. Hoyle, the scientists were Dr. William A. Fowler, ofCalifornia Institute of Technology; Dr. Burbidge and Dr. Margaret Burbidge, his wife. While the formation of the lighter elements, up to iron, could be explained by processes inside stars, extremely high temperatures and violent events were needed. The answer proposed by the four was the supernova, in which a giant star collapses to extreme density, then cataclysmically rebounds. For this and his subsequent work in astrophysics, Dr. Fowler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. The other three were omitted, probably in part because the prize is rarely, if ever, awarded to more than two people. Fred Hoyle's noncomformity manifested itself at an early age. Born in Bingley, Yorkshire, he found school boring, preferring to remain at home studying a textbook in elementary chemistry and doing chemistry experiments with equipment he found in his home. As recounted in his 1994 autobiography, ""Home Is Where the Wind Blows,"" in his parents' absence he enjoyed making gunpowder and creating explosions. As school was compulsory, his absence led to difficulties with the local authorities. The family did not have the funds to send him to a private school, but he finally won scholarships, including one from the West Riding of Yorkshire, and started on the path that eventually led him to Cambridge. As soon as he reached Cambridge he came under the tutelage of such top physicists as Rudolph Peierls, Eddington, P. A. M. Dirac and R. H. Fowler, whose calculations set the stage for the concept of black holes, stars whose collapse has yielded such density that the gravity prevents even light from escaping. During World War II he led a radar development group at an Admiralty Signal Establishment center in West Sussex, near the south coast. Working under him were two refugees from Vienna: Thomas Gold and Hermann Bondi. During the day the trio worked on radar. At night they discussed astrophysics, developing the steady-state cosmology. They accepted the evidence for its constant expansion, but proposed that matter is constantly formed to fill the gaps. In 1995 Dr. Bondi and Dr. Gold credited Dr. Hoyle with first proposing such continuous creation of new matter. Dr. John Faulkner, of the Lick Observatory in California, said that during the ""magical six years"" after establishment of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy at Cambridge in 1966, it became ""an obligatory mecca"" for young American astronomers, many of whom felt the institute ""fostered their best work."" But by his own account Sir Fred never shrank from controversy, and in 1972, after a falling out with Cambridge officialdom and rancorous debate on the future of British astronomy, he resigned as director of the institute. Sir Fred's work on interstellar organic molecules led him to propose that life originated in space. Working with a student, Chandra Wickramasinghe, he championed the unorthodox theory that the seeds of life, including disease viruses, periodically fall from space. They attributed the onset of various epidemics to such viruses, attempting to document this in the simultaneous appearance of influenza at schools in remote parts of England and Wales. These theories are reflected in titles of the books he did with Dr. Wickramasinghe: ""Lifecloud"" (1958), ""Diseases from Space"" (1979), ""Space Travelers: The Origins of Life"" (1980) and ""Cosmic Life Force"" (1988). His more conventional writing produced ""Frontiers of Astronomy,"" a widely used text. Dr. Hoyle, along with Dr. Geoffrey Burbidge and Dr. Jayant V. Narliker, renewed their fight against Big Bang orthodoxy with the book ""A Different Approach to Cosmology"" (Cambridge University Press, 2000). Dr. Hoyle was also a prolific author of science fiction, producing almost one book a year between 1950 and 1990, some written with his son, Geoffrey. Among the best known were ""The Black Cloud"" (1957) and ""Ossian's Ride"" (1958). In 1957 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and in the early 1970's he was president of the Royal Astronomical Society. He was knighted in 1972. In recent years he lived in Bournemouth. In addition to his son, also of Bournemouth, he is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Clark, whom he married in 1939, and a daughter Elizabeth Butler, a London stockbroker. ""Home for Hoyle,"" Stephen G. Brush, a science historian, wrote in 1995, ""is not a cozy cottage with an overstuffed chair in front of the fireplace. Not for him the comforts of academic tenure and the polite respect of colleagues. He is at home on the tops of mountains, at the cusps of controversies, where the winds blow fiercely and even God is not omnipotent but, as Hoyle says, just 'doing his best' to make an adequate universe."""
13468,"Arch West, 97; Helped Create Doritos Corn Chips","Snack-food lovers partial to Doritos owe that pleasure, in large part, to Arch West.","Snack-food lovers partial to Doritos owe that pleasure, in large part, to Arch West. Mr. West, who died on Sept. 20 at the age of 97, was a leader of the team at Frito-Lay that developed Doritos corn chips, a Southwestern-inspired alternative to the traditional salted potato or corn chip. Though the company, Frito-Lay North America, declines to give Mr. West full credit for the chip -- ''as a company, there's never one person to invent or is the father or mother of a given product,'' said Aurora Gonzalez, a spokeswoman -- others do. ''He widely gets the credit for Doritos,'' Andrew F. Smith, the author of the Encyclopedia of Junk Food and Fast Food (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006), said in an interview. Today, Doritos are Frito-Lay's second-best seller, after Lays Potato Chips, both nationally and around the world, with total sales of nearly $5 billion annually. Mr. West died at a hospital near his home in Dallas, his daughter, Jana Hacker, said. By her account, her father got the idea for Doritos in the early 1960s when he was vice president of marketing for what was then the Frito Company. (It is now a division of PepsiCo.) The family, while on vacation in San Diego, stopped at ''a little shack restaurant where these people were making a fried corn chip,'' she said. The chip's tangy taste captured her father's attention. Back in Dallas, after Frito merged with the H. W. Lay Company, he promoted the Doritos' production, which began in 1964, using corn tortillas cut into triangles and seasoned with cheese and chili flavorings. ''The '50s were very boring and bland in terms of snack foods, so this was a taste sensation,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It came out at just the right time, when Mexican-American food was breaking out of the Southwest and increasingly becoming national cuisine.'' In 1962, Glen W. Bell Jr. had opened in Downey, Calif., the first of what would become an international chain of Taco Bell restaurants. The flavorings associated with Doritos ''were Mexican-ish,'' Mr. Smith said. ''No one in Mexico would have consumed such a product, unless they were catering to American tourists.'' Still, he added, ''Doritos have been popular for almost half a century, so it's been an incredible invention.'' Archibald Clark West was born in Indianapolis on Sept. 8, 1914, to James and Jessie West. After graduating from Franklin College, near Indianapolis, he served as a gunnery officer in the Navy during World War II. Before joining Frito in 1960, he had worked in advertising in New York. Besides his daughter, Mr. West is survived by three sons, Jack, Richard and Greg; 12 grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. His wife of 69 years, the former Charlotte Thomson, died last year. When their ashes are buried together on Saturday, their daughter said, ''We're going to let everyone toss in a Dorito.''"

23876,"Vladimir Voevodsky, Dropout Turned Revolutionary Mathematician, Dies at 51","Vladimir Voevodsky, formerly a gifted but restless student who flunked out of college out of boredom before emerging as one of the most brilliant and revolutionary mathematicians of his generation, died on Sept. 30 at his home in Princeton, N.J.","Vladimir Voevodsky, formerly a gifted but restless student who flunked out of college out of boredom before emerging as one of the most brilliant and revolutionary mathematicians of his generation, died on Sept. 30 at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 51. Nadia Shalaby, his former wife, said he was found dead in his home by friends, whom she had called when she had not heard from him. They then called the police. He had been ill and had apparently collapsed, she said, but the exact cause of death had not been determined. Dr. Voevodsky was renowned for founding entirely new fields of mathematics and creating groundbreaking new tools for computers to confirm the accuracy of proofs. In 2002, he was awarded the Fields Medal, which recognizes brilliance and promise in mathematicians under 40. He was ''one of the giants of our time,'' Thomas Hales, a mathematician at the University of Pittsburgh, said in an interview. Dr. Voevodsky, he said, transformed every field he touched. In his work using computers, for example, he upended mathematical thinking to such a degree that he changed the meaning of the equals sign. ''If you want to ask how profound his work is, that's how profound it is,'' Dr. Hales said. ''It changes the very meaning of what the equals sign means in mathematics.'' He added: ''His ideas gave a new way for all mathematicians to do what they do, a new foundation. The foundations of math are like a constitutional document that spells out the governing rules all mathematicians agree to play by. He has given us a new constitution.'' Vladimir Voevodsky was born in Moscow on June 4, 1966. His father, Alexander, directed a laboratory in experimental physics at the Russian Academy of Sciences; his mother, Tatyana Voevodskaya, was a chemistry professor at Moscow University. Vladimir was kicked out of high school three times, once for disagreeing with his teacher's assertion that Dostoyevsky, who died in 1881, was pro-Communist. He was also kicked out of Moscow University after failing academically, having stopped attending classes that he considered a waste of time. He continued to study mathematics independently, however, and with the mathematician Mikhail Kapranov he published several papers so impressive that he was invited to enroll at Harvard as a graduate student, despite never having applied for admission there and holding no formal undergraduate degree. Once enrolled he again failed to attend lectures -- but his body of research was so astonishing, colleagues said, that no one cared. He graduated in 1992 and remained at Harvard to do a fellowship. After spending several years as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, he became a professor there in 2002 and remained there for the rest of his career. Dr. Voevodsky was awarded the Fields Medal for his discovery of an elusive mathematical object whose existence had been predicted decades earlier. The object provides a sort of mathematical wormhole that allows powerful theoretical tools in one field of mathematics to be pulled through and used in another. He then used those tools to crack a three-decade-old puzzle, giving birth to an entirely new area of mathematics called motivic homotopy theory. Soon afterward, however, he abandoned that branch of mathematics for what was perhaps a more quixotic quest, to find the answer to a fundamental question: How do mathematicians know that something they prove is actually true? This question became urgent for him as mathematicians were discovering -- sometimes decades after publication -- that proof after proof, including one of his own, had critical flaws. Mathematical arguments had gotten so complicated, he realized, that other mathematicians rarely checked them in detail. And his stellar reputation only made the problem worse: Everyone assumed that his proofs must be right. Dr. Voevodsky realized that human brains could not keep up with the ever-increasing complexity of mathematics. Computers were the only solution. So he embarked on an enormous project to create proof-checking software so powerful and convenient that mathematicians could someday use it as part of their ordinary work and create a library of rock-solid mathematical knowledge that anyone in the world could access. Computer scientists had worked on the problem for decades, but it was territory only a few mathematicians had ever ventured into. ''Among mathematicians, computer proof verification was almost a forbidden subject,'' Dr. Voevodsky wrote. The problem was that these systems were extraordinarily cumbersome. Checking a single theorem could require a decade of work, because the computer essentially had to be taught all of the mathematics a proof was built on, in agonizing, inhuman detail. Ordinary mathematicians intent on expanding the borders of the field could not possibly devote that kind of effort to checking their proofs. Somehow, computers and humans needed to be taught to think alike. Dr. Voevodsky developed a stunningly bold plan for how to do so: He reformulated mathematics from its very foundation, giving it a new ''constitution,'' as Dr. Hales put it. Mathematics so reformulated would be far friendlier to computers and allow mathematicians to talk to computers in a language that was much closer to how mathematicians ordinarily think. Today, Dr. Voevodsky declared in 2014, ''computer verification of proofs, and of mathematical reasoning in general, looks completely practical.'' Further, Dr. Voevodsky integrated the computer into the process of doing his own research, describing it as a bit like a video game. ''You tell the computer, 'Try this,' and it tries it, and it gives you back the result of its actions,'' he said in an interview with Scientific American in 2013. ''Sometimes it's unexpected what comes out of it. It's fun.'' Dr. Voevodsky was at the center of an informal but enormous effort to fulfill his vision, having inspired dozens of researchers to join it. ''He's been our leader, even though he lets everybody do whatever they want,'' said Robert Harper of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. ''He's this inspirational and spiritual leader by example.'' Dr. Voevodsky was especially attentive to young mathematicians. ''By being accommodating, encouraging, listening to people, he generated enormous interest,'' Dr. Harper said in a telephone interview. He also nurtured deep interests in many other fields, including biology, politics and nature photography. Besides Dr. Shalaby, he is survived by their two daughters, Diana Yasmine Voevodsky and Natalia Dalia Shalaby. Chris Kapulkin, another colleague, at the University of Western Ontario, said of Dr. Voevodsky in an interview, ''His contributions are so fundamental that it's impossible to imagine how things were thought of before him.''"
11047,"Mikhail Tal, a Chess Grandmaster Known for His Daring, Dies at 55","Mikhail Tal, a Latvian grandmaster who held the world chess championship in 1960-61 and was one of the game's most popular and exciting players, died in Moscow yesterday after a long illness, the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported.","Mikhail Tal, a Latvian grandmaster who held the world chess championship in 1960-61 and was one of the game's most popular and exciting players, died in Moscow yesterday after a long illness, the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported. He was 55 years old. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Mr. Tal had hoped to represent Latvia in this month's world chess Olympiad in Manila, but was unable to make the trip because of illness. No cause of death was given, but he had suffered from liver and kidney ailments for many years. Itar-Tass said he died after being taken to a hospital to undergo surgery for a severe kidney illness. Known in chess circles as a swashbuckling attacker who reveled in daring sacrifices and all-but-unfathomable complications over the board, Mr. Tal won the world championship in 1960 at the age of 23 -- becoming the youngest person to hold the title in this century -- by defeating Mikhail Botvinnik, who had been the champion since 1948. Although Mr. Tal lost the championship in a return match with Mr. Botvinnik a year later and never became a title challenger again, he continued to play at world-class levels of competition and steadily won tournament and brilliancy prizes in an illustrious chess career. While his slashing style earned him the sobriquet ""Tal the Terrible,"" friends called him Misha, and he was known in the chess fraternity as one of the game's most popular and amiable figures: a gentle, witty man who seemed totally immersed in chess and displayed none of the egotism that is common among top-level contenders. Because of his nearly lifelong struggle with liver and kidney ailments, friends recalled last night, it was not unusual for Mr. Tal to be hospitalized during tournaments. But he was so keen to continue that he often returned to the action and occasionally played tournament or match games at his hospital bed, as he did once in the early 1960's with Bobby Fischer, the American who would later become world champion. Mikhail Tal was born on Nov. 9, 1936, and was taught to play chess at the age of 6 by his father, a doctor in the Latvian village of Yurla, near Perm. Though he had an astonishing memory and was so eager for knowledge that he was placed in the fourth grade in his first year of school, the youngster showed little interest or talent for chess at first, preferring books and more active pastimes. But playing with a cousin a few years later sparked a new and absorbing interest in the game, and the boy joined the chess club of the Palace of Young Pioneers in Riga, the Latvian capital. He began playing in tournaments and steadily improved under an able tutor, Aleksandr Koblents. At the age of 16, Mr. Tal's play earned him the rank of national master and three years later, in 1957, the year he graduated from Riga University with degrees in history and philosophy, he became a grandmaster, joining the select ranks of the world's best players. He soon was beating those players regularly and, in 1960, crushed Mr. Botvinnik for the world championship by a score of 12 1/2 to 8 1/2, astounding the chess world. Mr. Botvinnik had held the championship for 12 years in one of the longest reigns in the game's history, and the intense young Latvian challenger was virtually unknown outside chess circles. Mr. Tal swept the champion away with his characteristic flare for the dramatic -- a series of sudden, entirely risky moves that turned the games into inextricably complex positions. Months of analysis later proved many of these moves to be unsound, but his opponent was unable to solve them over the board. In the return match in 1961, experts said, Mr. Botvinnik managed to avoid Mr. Tal's diabolical complications by steering the play into end games that gave him an advantage. In succeeding decades, Mr. Tal continued to play at exceptionally high grandmaster levels, despite his frail health. At the board, he often stared fixedly at opponents, a habit that disconcerted many and even led some to accuse him of trying to hypnotize them. But, experts said, it was his capacity to envision combinations and deeply analyze complex variations -- not hypnosis -- that made him formidable over the board. ""He had an insatiable appetite for the game,"" Robert Byrne, an American grandmaster who is The New York Times chess columnist, said of Mr. Tal last night. ""It sounds trite, but few love the game as much as he did. You could just see it. Some players consider it labor. This man loved chess."""

14984,Isaac Bashevis Singer's Funeral Tempers Grief With Remembrance,"His goblins, devils and witches may have been lurking somewhere around the funeral, but since their opinions of him could not be distinguished with any certainty, Isaac Bashevis Singer was remembered by relatives and companions yesterday for an impish wit and penetrating insight into human nature that enriched both his stories and those who knew him.","His goblins, devils and witches may have been lurking somewhere around the funeral, but since their opinions of him could not be distinguished with any certainty, Isaac Bashevis Singer was remembered by relatives and companions yesterday for an impish wit and penetrating insight into human nature that enriched both his stories and those who knew him. Still, when the rabbi's eulogy was repeatedly interrupted by growling noises from the amplifier system, more than a few mourners may have wondered whether the spirits he sometimes depicted with such zest and terror were having their revenge. ""Those are demons, by the way,"" Rabbi William Berkowitz finally said of the noises, to chuckles from mourners who sensed that it was the kind of confusion in which Mr. Singer would have delighted. Mr. Singer, who won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Literature for his sometimes mystical depiction of Jewish life in Poland and the bitter absurdities of immigrant life here, died on Wednesday in Florida at the age of 87. Lived a Full Life At Riverside Memorial Chapel at 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, his body lay inside a pine coffin flanked by sprays of roses and pink lilies and two menorahs. The presence of more than 300 people, from the worlds of Yiddish letters and theater -- but also struggling writers whom he had advised and neighborhood residents whom he had befriended -- was testimony to the rather modest life a man of Mr. Singer's stature managed to lead. Though there was a plaintive sense of loss and expressions of sadness for Alma, his wife of 50 years, the funeral was not an occasion for deep outpourings of grief. Sorrow was tempered by a feeling that, as Rabbi Berkowitz and Mr. Singer's son, Israel Zamir, said, Mr. Singer had lived a full life that made the world a far richer place for his having been in it. Rabbi Berkowitz remembered that Mr. Singer was once asked why he thought his story collection, ""Gimpel the Fool,"" was so popular. Mr. Singer replied that he guessed it was because people thought the book was about the famous department store, Gimbel's, which has since closed. ""I think I will name my next collection, 'Macy's the Idiot,' "" Mr. Singer added. 'The Sense of Wonder' ""Isaac was a genius, gifted beyond description,"" said Rabbi Berkowitz, explaining later that ""he never lost the sense of wonder and terror that a child feels."" Rabbi Berkowitz also remembered that Mr. Singer asked him to accompany him to Stockholm for the Nobel Prize ceremony. ""Since I write about demons and goblins,"" Mr. Singer explained to Swedish reporters, ""by having a rabbi here I wasn't taking any chances."" There was more than just humor, Rabbi Berkowitz said, there was a kind of wisdom to Mr. Singer's ironic perspective on life. Mr. Zamir, Mr. Singer's son by his first wife, Rachel, flew in from Israel, where he is deputy editor of the newspaper, Al Hamishmar. In a private conversation before the funeral, Mr. Zamir told how his parents had separated in Poland when he was 5, with Mr. Singer going to the United States in 1935 and his mother taking him to British-controlled Palestine. Father and son did not see each other for 20 years, until Mr. Zamir traveled to America. But they grew closer, Mr. Zamir said, through Mr. Zamir's Hebrew translations of his father's short stories. ""This intellectual attachment closed a gap of 20 years,"" said Mr. Zamir. Clustering before and after the funeral, mourners remembered a simplicity that cut through any pretension. Irene Lieblich, illustrator of his children's book, ""The Power of Light,"" remembered visiting him in Florida last Hanukkah, when he was greatly affected by a series of strokes. He did not recognize her, and could not respond to her requests that he autograph their book. Then, in Yiddish, she reminded him that she came from a town near his maternal grandmother's home of Bilgoraj. ""His eyes got blue again and alive,"" she recalled and Mr. Singer spoke: ""If you come from Bilgoraj, then you must know, 'Raisins and Almonds.' "" She sang the Yiddish lullaby for him and he called his wife to get him a pen. If there was not more display of grief, perhaps it was because, as Rabbi Berkowitz said in his eulogy, Mr. Singer had convinced those who knew him of his argument that ""the human spirit does not end with physical death,"" that ""every soul who ever lived is here in one way or the other."""
47236,ANNA ROSENBERG HOFFMAN DEAD; CONSULTANT AND 50'S DEFENSE AIDE,"Anna Rosenberg Hoffman, one of the most influential women in the country's public affairs for a quarter of a century and an assistant secretary of defense from 1950 to 1953, died of pneumonia yesterday in her Manhattan apartment.","Anna Rosenberg Hoffman, one of the most influential women in the country's public affairs for a quarter of a century and an assistant secretary of defense from 1950 to 1953, died of pneumonia yesterday in her Manhattan apartment. She had been suffering from cancer for more than a year. She was was 81 years old and also had a home in Katonah, N.Y. Mrs. Hoffman, a public relations executive for many years, specialized in manpower and personnel while in the Pentagon. She was then the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in the nation's military establishment. ''She knows more about labor relations and human relations,'' Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia once said, ''than any man in the country.'' Best known as Anna M. Rosenberg, she began her career in 1924 as a consultant in personnel and labor matters and became active in the Democratic Party. She was consulted by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he was Governor of New York. Soon after he became President, she was appointed to the National Recovery Administration, where she served until 1939, part of the time as New York regional director. Visited Europe for Presidents In 1944 and 1945, she visited Europe as the personal representative of Roosevelt and President Harry S. Truman to report on military personnel matters. Mrs. Hoffman was a partner in Anna M. Rosenberg Associates, a New York-based public relations and marketing consulting concern she founded in 1945. She came to her office regularly until a month ago. She took a leave of absence during her Pentagon service. The concern's clients include the American Cancer Society, the American Hospital Association, the American College of Hospital Administrators, Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. and Merriam-Webster Inc. Mrs. Hoffman occasionally antagonized people, but she had great charm and made friends of businessmen, union executives, political figures and high-ranking military officers as well as presidents. Respected as a Mediator She was widely respected as a source of ideas and as an enterprising mediator. A spokesman for her company, Owen Blicksilver, said yesterday that it was she who obtained for Nelson A. Rockefeller his first Federal post, as coordinator in the State Department's Office of Inter-American Affairs, in 1940. Born Anna Marie Lederer, she married Julius Rosenberg, a businessman, in 1919. She was divorced in 1962, and later that year married Paul G. Hoffman, a Republican who had been the first administrator of the Marshall Plan after World War II. He went on to head the United Nations Development Program. He died in 1974. Mrs. Hoffman was born in Budapest, and echoes of that city lingered in her speech all her life. The daughter of Albert Lederer and the former Charlotte Bacskai, she came to the United States with her family in 1912. She volunteered to serve as a student nurse during World War I, sold Liberty Bonds and was naturalized in 1919. As a teen-ager, she attended Wadleigh High School at Seventh Avenue and 114th Street in Manhattan. A schoolmate, writing about her years later, described her as ''an ignited Roman candle darting into space.'' 'Eloquence Brought Down House' The newspaper of another New York high school, De Witt Clinton, reported that she appeared at a meeting of schoolchildren opposed to military drill. ''Miss Anna Lederer was the principal speaker,'' the newspaper recorded. ''In a voice vibrant with emotion and with an enthusiastic eloquence that brought down the house, Miss Lederer pledged the allegiance of Wadleigh to our cause.'' '' 'We will stick with you to the end,' she declared, 'but for God's sake don't queer things by striking.' '' Mrs. Hoffman retained a flair for dramatizing her activities in public life. In the 1930's, during a strike by some New York subway electricians, she put on hip boots and descended into a subway tunnel to look over electrical equipment, which had become an issue in the strike. Held National Posts During War In 1934, Nathan Straus Jr., then the New York regional director of the National Recovery Administration. named her his assistant, and in 1936 she succeeded him. The following year, she also became a regional director with the Social Security Board, serving until 1943. She was with the Office of Defense Health and Welfare Services in 1941 and 1942, a regional director with the War Manpower Commmission from 1942 to 1945, and a consultant to the Retraining and Reemployment Administration from 1941 to 1945. Mr. Blicksilver said that when Roosevelt sent her to Europe in 1944, it was to look into soldiers' needs after they were demobilized. She reported that education was what many soldiers were particularly interested in, Mr. Blicksilver said, and that encouraged Roosevelt to support the G.I. Bill of Rights. A decade later, when Mrs. Hoffman was selected for the Defense Department post by Truman, the appointment was challenged on the false ground of Communist affiliation. But she was confirmed and worked on plans for universal military service and training. Served on Board of Education Mrs. Hoffman later held other government assignments. In 1955, when Mayor Robert F. Wagner put her on the New York City Board of Hospitals, she had a dozen other roles in public life, ranging from a seat on Gov. W. Averell Harriman's Business Advisory Council to cochairman of the National Heart Committee. In 1959, she was made chairman of a three-member panel named to mediate between the Transit Authority and two unions. She was on the New York City Board of Education in the early 1960's, and over the years served on a score of other city and state bodies. She was also long active in various educational, cultural and philanthropic organizations, including the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation and the John Hay Whitney Foundation. Mrs. Rosenberg received honorary doctorates from Tufts and Columbia Universities. Truman awarded her the Medal for Merit, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded her the Medal of Freedom. Mrs. Hoffman is survived by a son, Thomas J. Rosenberg; a sister, Clare Lederer von Arnold, both of New York, and one grandchild. No funeral is planned but a memorial service will be held at a date to be announced."
13640,"Lionel Hebert, 72, Pro Golfer, Winner of P.G.A. Championship","Lionel Hebert, who joined with Jay Hebert to form one of golf's leading brother combinations, each of them winners of the P.G.A.","Lionel Hebert, who joined with Jay Hebert to form one of golf's leading brother combinations, each of them winners of the P.G.A. Championship, died on Saturday at his home in Lafayette, La. He was 72. He had congestive heart failure, diabetes and kidney problems, his wife, Clara Belle, said. From the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's, Lionel and Jay Hebert (pronounced A-bear), Louisiana natives, were leading players on the PGA Tour. Lionel won the St. Petersburg Open (1956), the Tucson Open (1958), the Cajun Classic (1960), the Memphis Open (1962) and the Citrus Open (1966) in addition to capturing the 1957 P.G.A. Championship. He also played on the Ryder Cup team in 1957. Jay won the P.G.A. Championship in 1960 -- the Heberts becoming the only brothers to capture that major tournament -- and was the captain of the 1971 Ryder Cup team. He died in 1997 at 74. Lionel won his P.G.A. Championship at the Miami Valley Golf Club in Dayton, Ohio, upsetting Dow Finsterwald, 2 and 1, in a scheduled 36-hole final, the last time the tournament used a match-play format. Entering that tournament, he was 49th on the earnings list for the year while Finsterwald was third. He had competed twice before in the P.G.A. Championship but had not gone past the fourth round. But in the semifinals, he defeated Walter Burkemo, who had beaten his older brother Jay in the previous round. He then emerged victorious over Finsterwald for his first pro victory and his biggest paycheck: $8,000. Lionel Hebert appeared in 580 events on the PGA Tour and the Senior Tour before retiring in 1986, but he never went to the British Open because, as he once recalled, the trip ""was so pricey"" and ""the money wasn't there."" A native of Lafayette, he was a barefoot caddie at age 8. He turned pro in 1950, but it was not until the fall of 1956 that he quit his job as a club pro, in Erie, Pa., to become a touring professional. To improve his technique, he studied photos of the swings of golf's greatest players. Golf was not Hebert's only forte. He had studied music at Louisiana State University and was a fine trumpet player, carrying horns in his luggage while on tour, gifts from his friends Harry James and Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. ""I play it whenever I feel down,"" he said after winning the P.G.A. Championship. He was certainly upbeat the following year, when he won at Tucson. Next to capturing the P.G.A. Championship, it was his biggest thrill because he proved to himself that his victory in the major tournament was no fluke. Hebert was the national vice president of the Professional Golfers Association twice, the chairman of its tournament committee in 1962-63 and 1972-73 and a member of the rules committee.

Dubin, whose career as a daring director in television's early years stalled after he refused to answer questions before Congress about Communist involvement, then robustly rebounded as he went on to direct more episodes of ''M*A*S*H'' than anyone else, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 92. His daughter, Zan Dubin-Scott, announced the death. In the early 1950s, Mr. Dubin helped shape early television by directing shows like ''Tales of Tomorrow,'' a science fiction anthology series, and ''Two Girls Named Smith,'' a comedy series starring Peggy Ann Garner. He moved up to more highbrow shows like ''Omnibus,'' which offered programming in the arts and sciences. In early 1958 he directed some of the first programs of the New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts, conducted and moderated by Leonard Bernstein. Then in June of that year he was subpoenaed to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which was investigating show-business figures for possible Communist ties. Mr. Dubin said he was not a Communist and 22 times refused to say whether he had ever been one, citing constitutional protections against self-incrimination. He was also asked about a play he had directed for Stage for Action, a leftist theater group. But he refused to answer questions about the group. The committee did not cite him for contempt. But NBC, which had televised two shows he directed -- ''Twenty One,'' a quiz show, and its summer replacement, ''The Investigator'' -- terminated his association with the network, calling his answers ''unacceptable.'' The New York Civil Liberties Union condemned the action as ''an indefensible capitulation'' to McCarthyism. Though his case went to arbitration, he was not reinstated. After his dismissal, Mr. Dubin had trouble finding work in television and was forced to turn to directing commercials. But he returned to television in 1961 to direct ''The Defenders,'' a CBS courtroom drama starring E. G. Marshall, and ''The Virginian,'' a western on NBC, the following year. In 1965 he directed the telecast of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ''Cinderella,'' starring Lesley Ann Warren. Over the next 25 years he directed episodes of some of prime-time television's most popular shows, among them ''Cannon,'' ''Lou Grant,'' ''Hawaii Five-0,'' ''Rockford Files,'' ''Sanford and Son,'' ''Ironside,'' ''Matlock,'' ''Kojak,'' ''Cagney and Lacey'' and ''Father Dowling Mysteries.'' But he was most closely associated with ''M*A*S*H,'' the long-running, award-winning, darkly comic series about an Army medical unit in the Korean War. He directed 44 episodes of the show, which was shot on film and admired for its high production values. Three were nominated for directing Emmys. One episode, in 1978, was experienced entirely through the eyes of a wounded soldier, whose throat wound prevented him from speaking to other characters. The episode was a favorite of fans and of Alan Alda, the show's star. Ken Levine, a writer of the episode, praised Mr. Dubin on his blog for persuading actors who are trained never to look directly at the camera to do exactly that. The camera, of course, was the wounded soldier's eyes. In 1979 Mr. Dubin directed two episodes of ''Roots: The Next Generations,'' a continuation of the Alex Haley family history. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called it ''a more polished and sophisticated production'' than the earlier series. Mr. Dubin also won a daytime Emmy in 1990 for his work on ''Square One TV,'' a Children's Television Workshop show that taught mathematical concepts. Charles Samuel Dubronevski, who later changed his last name to make it shorter, was born on Feb. 1, 1919, in Brooklyn. He first aspired to be an opera singer. He graduated from Brooklyn College in 1941 and studied acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. He performed comedy and drama in the Catskills, appeared in opera in Philadelphia as a singing comedian and had small parts in three Broadway plays. Mr. Dubin's first marriage, to Daphne Elliott, ended in divorce in 1975. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, the former Mary Lou Chayes. His experience before Congress in 1958 had echoes in 1979, when he directed a ''''M*A*S*H'''' episode called ''Are You Now, Margaret?'' In the episode, a congressional aide comes to Korea to investigate suspicions that Maj. Margaret Houlihan was a Communist and to compel her to identify others who were. Asked to name names, she refuses."

5743,"William Demby, 90, Author Of Experimental Novels","William Demby, whose novels, written while he was an expatriate in Italy, challenged literary conventions and expectations of what a black writer should write about, died on May 23 at his home in Sag Harbor, N.Y.","William Demby, whose novels, written while he was an expatriate in Italy, challenged literary conventions and expectations of what a black writer should write about, died on May 23 at his home in Sag Harbor, N.Y. He was 90. His wife, Barbara Morris, confirmed the death. Mr. Demby was interested in boundaries -- between people, and between the present and the past -- and he liked crossing them. His marriage in 1953 to an Italian actress and writer, Lucia Drudi, made news in Rome. (He spent many years writing English-language subtitles for films by Federico Fellini, Roberto Rossellini and other Italian directors.) His first novel, ''Beetlecreek,'' published in 1950 while he was living in Italy, described the unexpected relationships that develop among a reclusive white man, a black teenage boy and others in a small Southern town. Some critics called the book disjointed, but many praised Mr. Demby for the depth of his characters. Mr. Demby, who lived outside Florence in a villa his wife had inherited, spent the next several years writing freelance magazine articles as well as doing film translation work while working on his second novel. That novel, ''The Catacombs,'' was published 15 years after ''Beetlecreek.'' It was an experimental blend of fiction and nonfiction in which one of the main characters, a man named Bill Demby, writes a book about a black actress named Doris who grows weary of him. The narrative, interspersed with newspaper clippings, philosophical detours and stream-of-consciousness observations, confounded some critics. ''Impatience sets in for this reader as much as it does for poor Doris,'' Peter Buitenhuis wrote in a review in The New York Times in 1965. But others were impressed, and some said Mr. Demby was criticized in part because he did not focus primarily on racial issues. The critic Robert Bone, writing in The Times in 1969, called ''The Catacombs'' ''one of the two important black novels of the 1960s,'' along with ''The Chosen Place, the Timeless People,'' by Paule Marshall. James C. Hall, who teaches history and literature at the University of Alabama, interviewed Mr. Demby extensively in the 1990s for ''Mercy, Mercy Me,'' his book about efforts by black artists of the 1960s to reach beyond race. ''A lot of the complaints about it were that it didn't seem sufficiently black,'' Mr. Hall said of the reaction to ''The Catacombs'' in a recent interview. ''There's no question that 'Catacombs' was really ambitious,'' he added. ''He did not want to speak of racial justice in a direct way. But you could make the argument it did, by defending the right of the African-American artist to choose whatever subject matter and to choose whatever method he or she thought was most appropriate.'' In a 2004 interview with The Bloomsbury Review, Mr. Demby said, ''Since 'Catacombs,' I think I have been kicked out of the Black Arts race.'' He kept writing. In 1978 he published ''Love Story Black,'' about an unlikely romance between an elderly woman and a much younger man. In the mid-1980s he began working on a sprawling novel, ''King Comus,'' that traces the plights of Jews and blacks deep into 19th-century Europe. He finished the book in 2008, said his son, James, who composes and teaches music in Italy, but it has not found a publisher. James Demby said his father read excerpts from the book in 2006 when he received an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for lifetime achievement. The awards recognize books that address racism and diversity. William Edward Demby Jr. was born on Dec. 25, 1922, in Pittsburgh. His father worked for a gas company and sang in a gospel group. His mother, whose lineage was partly Native American, was a schoolteacher. After Mr. Demby graduated from high school, his family moved to Clarksburg, W.Va. He briefly attended West Virginia State University before he was drafted into the Army during World War II. He served in North Africa and Italy and wrote for Stars and Stripes, the Army magazine. Soon after receiving a bachelor's degree from Fisk University in Nashville in 1947, Mr. Demby returned to Italy, where he met Ms. Drudi in 1950. She died in 1995. During the '50s he wrote dispatches on the civil rights movement for The Reporter magazine, published in New York. His second wife and son are his only immediate survivors. He met Ms. Morris, a former lawyer for the N.A.A.C.P., at Fisk, and they married in 2004. In 1969, Mr. Demby began teaching English at the College of Staten Island of the City University of New York, though he continued to spend part of his time in Italy. He retired in the late 1980s. He once told The Bloomsbury Review that he recognized his uncertain standing among some critics. ''I believed, as I still do, that a black writer has the same kind of mind that writers have had all through time,'' he said. ''He can imagine any world he wants to imagine.''"

Pugliese, a composer, conductor and percussionist, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 41. The cause was a stroke, according to his father, Michael. Mr. Pugliese toured with the musical ensemble of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, the composer John Cage and the road company of ""Jesus Christ Superstar."" He also played with ensembles including the Brooklyn Philharmonic, the Buffalo Philharmonic and the Philharmonia Virtuosi. He was best known, however, as a proponent of new music.

Henryk Jankowski, a Polish priest who gained prominence in the 1980s by supporting Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement but later saw his reputation marred by anti-Semitic remarks and an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse of a minor, died on Monday in Gdansk.","WARSAW (AP) -- The Rev. Henryk Jankowski, a Polish priest who gained prominence in the 1980s by supporting Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement but later saw his reputation marred by anti-Semitic remarks and an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse of a minor, died on Monday in Gdansk. He was 73. His death was announced by Pawel Adamowicz, the mayor of Gdansk. Mr. Adamowicz did not give a cause of death, but Polish news reports noted that Father Jankowski had battled diabetes for years. Father Jankowski, who was the parish priest for the St. Brygida church in Gdansk, came to national prominence when he celebrated Masses for shipyard workers striking under Mr. Walesa's leadership -- resistance that paved the way for Communism's eventual demise in Poland. He was one of many priests who waded into dangerous waters to support Solidarity's struggle for freedom against Communist rule. Father Jankowski's reputation took a battering in the years after Communism's collapse because of anti-Semitic remarks he made. During one homily, for instance, he said that members of ''the Jewish minority cannot be tolerated in the Polish government.'' He was also investigated on charges of sexually abusing a minor, though never convicted. He said he was innocent and called the accusations a slander campaign orchestrated by ''Jews and Judeo-Communists.'' In 1997, Father Jankowski was barred from giving sermons for one year by Roman Catholic authorities following repeated anti-Semitic remarks. He was removed as rector of St. Brygida in 2004. In 2007, he told a Polish newspaper that he was planning to talk to Mel Gibson about making his life story into a movie. A spokesman for Mr. Gibson denied at the time that any such project was being discussed."
48336,"Martin Dubilier, 65, an Inventor Who Invested in Companies, Dies","Martin H. Dubilier, an inventor who achieved prominence as an investor in poorly performing companies that he could fix up, died yesterday at the age of 65.","Martin H. Dubilier, an inventor who achieved prominence as an investor in poorly performing companies that he could fix up, died yesterday at the age of 65. He lived in Greenwich, Conn., and Fisher Island, Fla. He died of lung cancer, said a spokesman for the firm, Clayton & Dubilier Inc. Mr. Dubilier, known as ""Dubie"" to friends and colleagues, had been the chairman of the company, a New York investment firm which he helped found in 1978. The firm currently owns stakes in eight companies including O. M. Scott & Sons Company, the lawn-care giant, and Lexmark International, a typewriter and supplies business formerly owned by I.B.M. The son of William F. Dubilier, an inventor who had accumulated more than 300 patents in his lifetime, the younger Mr. Dubilier nearly followed in his father's footsteps. He invented a rust-resistant train track at the age of 12, an idea which Lionel bought and shelved just to protect what was then a lucrative market in replacement track. Six years later, he invented a low-voltage flash bulb that eliminated the need for battery packs. He also helped to develop the daisy-wheel printer while he was an executive of Friden Inc., a subsidiary of Singer. A Quirky Sense of Humor He served in the Navy during World War II and was one of only a handful of survivors when a kamikaze plane crashed into the U.S.S. Mulaney and set it on fire. Intent on a career in business, Mr. Dubilier earned an engineering degree from Princeton University in 1950 and a master's degree in business administration from Harvard Business School in 1952. After stints at McKinsey & Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, and Friden, he became the chief executive in 1968 of Kearney National Inc., a diversified manufacturer, where he delighted many of his colleagues not only with his sharp skills as an operator, but also with his quirky sense of humor and love of mischief. For instance, he once took great pleasure catering a Kearney board meeting by instructing his secretary to run out to a favorite hot dog stand on Vanderbilt Avenue and 46th Street in Manhattan and buy 30 franks. Turning Companies Around ""He didn't take himself very serious,"" said Andrall E. Pearson, a Harvard Business School professor who had known Mr. Dubilier for over two decades, since they both worked as consultants for McKinsey. Together with Eugene Clayton, who retired in 1985, Mr. Dubilier started a crisis-management firm in 1976, helping troubled companies that the pair thought it could turn around. But with the arrival in 1978 of Joseph L. Rice 3d as the firm's finance-oriented president, the firm eventually made a bigger name for itself in leveraged buyouts, the investment fashionable in the 1980's in which investors borrowed heavily to take companies private in the hopes of selling off undervalued assets or otherwise running the businesses more intelligently and profitably. Since 1978, the firm has purchased 16 businesses with combined sales of $10 billion -- including some that other buyout kings scorned such as Homeland Stores Inc. a marginally profitable, Oklahoma-based supermarket chain that was part of Safeway Stores until its owners at Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company put it on the block. ""The difference was K.K.R. was really into the megadeal,"" said Bernard Black, a law professor at Columbia law school who sits on Homeland's board. ""Martin was generally interested in building businesses and building companies, in helping them grow."" Certainly, the company has performed well for its investors. Since 1978, it has produced compounded returns in excess of 100 percent a year. According to Mr. Rice, the company will buy out Mr. Dubilier's 28.6 percent stake. As a result, he and Alberto Cribiore will each own 40 percent of the firm and Peter F. Dolle, the other owner, will own 20 percent. Mr. Dubilier is survived two sons, Michael and William, and a daughter, Patricia Coughlin, all of New York; and one grandchild. His first wife, Mary Jane, whom he divorced, died in 1990. His second wife, Sandra, remarried after their divorce."
15843,Edward Sulzberger Is Dead at 80; President of Real Estate Concern,"Edward Sulzberger, a patriarch of the New York real estate industry who was chairman of the board and former president of Sulzberger-Rolfe, died last night at his home in Manhattan.","Edward Sulzberger, a patriarch of the New York real estate industry who was chairman of the board and former president of Sulzberger-Rolfe, died last night at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old. Mr. Sulzberger served as president of Sulzberger-Rolfe for 33 years. Under his guidance, the company became a diversified real estate organization involved in building management, cooperative conversions and sales, leasing, appraisals and urban redevelopment. He was a vigorous spokesman for the industry and was often in the public eye. In 1967, he represented the industry in negotiations during a building service strike. Opposed Rent Control A critic of rent control, Mr. Sulzberger once predicted that ''New York's housing will become a massive and growing slum, if rent control is continued.'' He was born in a brownstone on East 72d Street. His father, Myron Sulzberger, was a lawyer who served as a Municipal Court judge for 17 years. Mr. Sulzberger attended DeWitt Clinton High School and the Dwight School, and graduated in 1929 from Brown University, where he met his wife, the former Maye Dorfman, who attended Pembroke College. His first venture after graduation was a baking business. But an allergy to flour sent him into real estate, and by 1942 he was handling 50 buildings. Ten years later he acquired the company of Joseph H. Nassoit, changing its name in 1966 to Sulzberger-Rolfe. He joined his own name with that of his business partner and son-in-law, N. Anthony Rolfe, who succeeded him as president this year. Served on Housing Panel Mr. Sulzberger was appointed in 1982 by President Reagan to the board of directors of the National Corporation for Housing Partnerships. The board was created to increase the participation of private industry in the construction of housing for low- and moderate-income families. Mr. Sulzberger was a former president of the Metropolitan Fair Rent Committee and the Association for Government Assisted Housing, honorary chairman of the New York Rent Stabilization Committee and a member of the Realty Foundation of New York. He was a trustee of Tougaloo College in Jackson, Miss., and a former trustee of Brown University. He was active in more than 30 civic groups, including the boards of directors of Doctors Hospital, B'nai Brith, the United Jewish Appeal and the Flying Doctors in Kenya. In 1986, he established the Edward Sulzberger Foundation, a philanthropic fund. Mr. Sulzberger was an avid golfer and was a member and former president of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club in Scarsdale, N.Y. He also collected handmade figures of soldiers in English and Scottish regiments. In addition to his wife, he is survived by their daughter, Susan S.

Kiermaier, who steered Channel 13, the New York area's major public television station, through precarious financial times in the 1960s, died July 27 in Norwalk, Conn. He was 87 and had lived in Westport, Conn., until two years ago. The death was confirmed by his son, Lock. Mr. Kiermaier was president of what was then called WNDT/Channel 13 (it is now WNET/Channel 13) from September 1964 to May 1970. The station, which first went on the air on Sept. 16, 1962, was facing severe budget cuts and layoffs by the time Mr. Kiermaier succeeded Samuel Gould as president of its management company, the Educational Broadcasting Corporation. The crunch was alleviated over the next five years, with Mr. Kiermaier leading efforts that secured significant grants from organizations like the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the CBS network, where he had worked for five year. Channel 13 ''came very close to the final wire,'' Mr. Kiermaier said in 1965. That year, The New York Times wrote that Mr. Kiermaier had ''generated among the station's employees a sense of purpose and a measure of excitement that have not prevailed for well over a year.'' Among the shows that Mr. Kiermaier introduced on Channel 13 were ''Broadcasting Forum,'' a panel discussion by producers, performers, newscasters and policymakers about the state of television and radio; ''The Young Artists,'' a series that showcased emerging actors, musicians, dancers, painters and poets; and ''All Things Considered,'' which offered opinions on contemporary arts. (It is not the ''All Things Considered'' news roundup heard on public radio stations since 1971.) Under his leadership, the station went to being on the air seven days from five. Cultural and informational programs had been Mr. Kiermaier's focus in his years as vice president of public affairs at CBS. There, he supervised the production of shows like ''One of a Kind,'' a series on art, music, poetry and history; and ''Accent,'' which roamed the country to broadcast music and drama festivals. John William Kiermaier was born in Brooklyn on June 28, 1922, one of two sons of Alfred and Margaret Nelson Kiermaier. His father was an engineer for AT&T. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1943. Then, after serving in the Navy during World War II, he received a law degree from Yale in 1948. Soon after, he was hired as an intern at NBC, where over the next 10 years he rose to assistant producer while working with, among other producers, Grant Tinker. Mr. Kiermaier resigned from Channel 13 and was appointed a vice chancellor of Long Island University. Four years later, he returned to CBS as president of the CBS Foundation. Besides his son, Mr. Kiermaier is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Constance Whitehead; three daughters, Faith Feder, Lucy Michaud and Johanna Lindsay; and three grandsons."
26237,"Chen Xitong, 82, Mayor in Tiananmen Crackdown, Dies","Chen Xitong, the mayor of Beijing during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, died on Sunday, two days before the 24th anniversary of the armed crackdown he had championed.","HONG KONG -- Chen Xitong, the mayor of Beijing during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, died on Sunday, two days before the 24th anniversary of the armed crackdown he had championed. He was 82. The cause was cancer, China's state-run news agency, Xinhua, said Wednesday, confirming reports in the Hong Kong news media and on overseas Chinese Web sites the day before. Official confirmation appeared to have been delayed until after the anniversary on Tuesday, when the government was on guard against any displays of defiance. Mr. Chen's hard-line stance during the protests earned him promotion from the Communist Party and scorn from its opponents. But he was ultimately reviled and disowned by the party as well, accused of turning the Chinese capital into his brazenly corrupt fief. For Mr. Chen, a career that had started with literary yearnings ended in prison. His death was little mourned publicly. The Hong Kong news media said he had been cremated in Beijing; the Xinhua bulletin gave no such details. The party issued no public praise or condolences as it usually does on the death of a dignitary. ''He was a tragic figure; he was a puppet used by more powerful people,'' said Yao Jianfu, a former official and government researcher in Beijing, who published a book in Hong Kong last year based on his conversations with Mr. Chen. ''He started as a Chinese literature student at Peking University and could have become a poet or writer,'' Mr. Yao said in a telephone interview. ''But he joined the revolution and became a politician, and he'll always be known for his role in the June 4 tragedy.'' On that day in 1989, soldiers and armored vehicles swept into central Beijing and opened fire, killing, by many estimates, hundreds of people. Party leaders had ordered them to put down the protests in Tiananmen Square, where for two months tens of thousands of students and other citizens had demanded expanded legal rights, an end to corruption and steps toward democracy. Party roles in China carry much more power than government ones, but Mr. Chen, as Beijing's mayor, and several other hard-line officials won the ear of Deng Xiaoping, the party patriarch, arguing that the protesters were a dire threat to one-party rule. In embracing their assertions and approving a crackdown, Mr. Deng shunted aside Zhao Ziyang, the relatively moderate party general secretary. In memoirs published posthumously in 2009, Mr. Zhao said Mr. Chen had joined forces with the prime minister, Li Peng, and the party secretary of Beijing, Li Ximing, to convince Mr. Deng that the protests were part of a plot that would imperil him and the party. Mr. Chen played a bigger role in the upheavals than he cared to admit, said Zhou Duo, who was among a group of intellectuals who negotiated with soldiers on June 4, 1989, to avoid bloodshed in Tiananmen Square itself. ''He egged on Deng Xiaoping to take a hard-line direction at a very critical moment,'' said Mr. Zhou, who lives in Beijing. ''He, Li Peng and Li Ximing played a very important role in encouraging Deng to take a mistaken course.'' Mr. Chen was born on June 10, 1930, in Sichuan Province, in southwest China. He joined the Communist Party in 1949, beginning a climb up the ladder of power in Beijing. He won more power after the 1989 protests were crushed, becoming the party secretary of Beijing and a member of the Politburo, the council of top party officials. He promoted Beijing's failed campaign for the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, which went to Sydney, Australia. (Beijing won the Games for 2008.) In the 1990s, Beijing residents joked about ''Xitong hats,'' the incongruous, pseudotraditional roofs that Mr. Chen was said to have ordered for new modernist buildings. But Mr. Chen also accumulated rivals, including Jiang Zemin, the party chief who was appointed in 1989 and became president in 1993. Mr. Chen was dismissed from office in 1995 over a spreading scandal in Beijing; in 1998 he was tried and sentenced to 16 years in prison on charges of corruption and dereliction of duty. He and other officials contended that his real error had been in falling out with Mr. Jiang, said Mr. Yao, the retired official. Mr. Chen was released from prison on medical parole in 2006 but usually remained under guard, Mr. Yao said. As portrayed in the book that Mr. Yao published, Mr. Chen rejected the accusations against him, presenting himself as a nave underling manipulated by top party leaders. The corruption case against him was an ''absurd miscarriage of justice,'' he said. Mr. Yao said he believed that Mr. Chen was survived by his wife, Ye Zi, and a son, Chen Xiaotong. Apart from the June 4 crackdown, Mr. Chen's legacy may be as the sole senior official behind it who displayed any remorse about the bloodshed. ''Chen Xitong believed it was a tragedy that could, and should, have been avoided,'' Mr. Yao said. ''He didn't say 'I apologize' or 'I'm guilty,' but he said he felt regret for the innocent victims.'' ''That was too little, but after all, no other leader has said even that.''"

Mr. Huffman, who had been ill with pneumotoxis pneumonia for the last two months, was 35 years old. He lived in Manhattan. Mr. Huffman had an instant impact as a young dancer, coming to notice in Eliot Feld's ''Meadowlark.'' His early promise was fulfilled in 1980 when he offered what could be called the definitive performance of the day in the Joffrey's widely hailed revival of Vaslav Nijinsky's ''Apres-Midi d'un Faune.'' Unlike others in the title role, Mr. Huffman was able to eschew static poses; he made the sensuous faun tense with anticipation, aligning his body into a flow of maximum expressiveness. A highly versatile dancer, Mr. Huffman excelled as the romantic lead in such works as Agnes de Mille's ''Rodeo,'' Robert Joffrey's ''Remembrances'' and John Cranko's ''Pineapple Poll.'' He was also a partner in the classical style in Sir Frederick Ashton's ballets. He had leading roles in such contemporary works as Jerome Robbins's ''Moves'' and Gerald Arpino's ''Trinity.'' In recent years, Mr. Huffman turned to choreography. The Memphis Ballet presented his pas de deux ''Behind the Garden Wall'' last month. Summer Study Mr. Huffman was born in Orlando, Fla., where he studied with Edith Royal, from whose school Robert Joffrey frequently recruited dancers. Mr. Huffman spent summers studying in New York at the American Ballet Center and the Joffrey school, and danced with Royal Ballet Concert and the Southeast Regional Ballet before joining the apprentice company then called Joffrey II. He joined the Joffrey Ballet in 1972, performing as a regular member through 1981 and then as guest artist until 1983. Mr. Huffman became a member of the Joffrey school's faculty last July. He is survived by his parents, Thomas and Macel Huffman of Orlando, and a brother, Harry."

32577,"John Griffin, 84, Who Helped Bridge the Gulf Between the Races","John A. Griffin, an educator and a major figure in the civil rights movement in the South, died of pneumonia on Saturday at Piedmont Hospital here.","ATLANTA, Jan. 27 John A. Griffin, an educator and a major figure in the civil rights movement in the South, died of pneumonia on Saturday at Piedmont Hospital here. He was 84 and lived in Atlanta. Dr. Griffin, long known as a gentle, conciliating figure in race relations, was a founder of the Southern Regional Council, formed in 1944 to bring white and black Southerners together. He was also president of the Southern Education Foundation and a longtime teacher and administrator at Emory University here. ""He was constantly looking for ways to connect people he met so they could find strength in numbers,"" said John Egerton, the author of ""Speak Now Against the Day,"" (Knopf, 1994), a history of race relations in the South from the New Deal to the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954. Dr. Griffin, who was white, was born in Monroe, Ga., on July 3, 1912. He received undergraduate and master's degrees from Emory and a doctorate in sociology and agricultural economics from the University of Wisconsin. During his tenure at Emory, from 1944 to 1959, Dr. Griffin served variously as assistant to the president, director of the community education service and associate professor of sociology. He also taught at Georgia Tech and Florida State University. Perhaps the most lasting product of his commitment to racial equality was the Southern Regional Council, which he founded with others, like Ralph McGill, former editor of The Atlanta Constitution. He was active in civil rights issues, particularly those affecting education, throughout the 1950's and 1960's. During part of that time he was associate director for conciliation with the United States Community Relations Service, working to resolve volatile racial crises in places like Selma, Ala.; McComb, Miss., and Houma, La. From 1965 to 1978, he was executive director of the Southern Education Foundation, which provides support for historically black colleges and other programs intended to assure educational opportunity for black youths. Aside from the Southern Regional Council, he is perhaps best known for research that he helped bring together but, characteristically, never took credit for. While teaching at Emory, he helped organize a Ford Foundation study of the South's segregated schools. The project led to the book ""The Negro and the Schools"" by the journalist Harry Ashmore, which is credited with having influenced the Supreme Court when it formulated policies for the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 Brown decision declaring segregation illegal. Dr. Griffin's first wife, Wallace Lillard Lyons, died in 1960. He is survived by his wife, the former Anne Ryland Ricks of Atlanta, and four children by his first wife, Sarah Lockhart Griffin of Decatur, Ga., Mary Griffin Turnbull of Sausalito, Calif., John Jr., of Decatur, and William H., of Clearwater, Fla., and three grandchildren."

54020,"Jose Bezerra da Silva, 77, Brazilian Known for Samba","Jose Bezerra da Silva, a revered samba singer whose witty lyrics extolling the lives of street thugs and hustlers made him an inspiration to a generation of Brazilian hip-hop artists, died on Monday in Rio de Janeiro.","SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 17 Jose Bezerra da Silva, a revered samba singer whose witty lyrics extolling the lives of street thugs and hustlers made him an inspiration to a generation of Brazilian hip-hop artists, died on Monday in Rio de Janeiro. He was 77. The cause was heart failure after a severe lung infection, according to a spokesman for Servidores do Estado Hospital, where he had been on a respirator since Oct. 28. Mr. da Silva, who was known in the music world as Bezerra da Silva, was one of the most colorful and controversial figures in Brazil's music industry. He played an important role in popularizing the bad-boy image of the ''malandro,'' the stereotypical Brazilian bohemian who scorns work and revels in pulling fast ones on unwitting victims. For more than four decades, Mr. da Silva sang about the drug lords and street criminals that rule Brazil's sprawling urban shantytowns, mixing irony and social criticism to create a popular music genre that came to be known as ''sambandido'' (bandit samba). Some critics have called the genre samba's equivalent of gangsta rap. Mr. da Silva's lyrics also frequently denounced political corruption and police brutality, making him a prominent voice of the poor in Brazil. Jose Bezerra da Silva was born into poverty on March 9, 1927, in Recife, the capital of the northeastern state of Pernambuco. When he was 15, he migrated to Rio as a stowaway on a cargo ship and settled in Morro do Cantagalo, one of the city's most notorious hillside slums. He spent his early years in Rio working as a day laborer at construction sites and dabbling with music on the side in a local samba school. In the 1950's, the raspy-voiced Mr. da Silva began performing professionally for radio programs and in nightclubs, but he did not record his first single until 1969. In 1975, at the age of 48, he finally released his first full album, ''O Rei do Coco'' (''The King of Coco,'' referring to a traditional dance style from northeastern Brazil). He went on to record 27 more albums, with titles like ''Produto do Morro'' (''Product of the Shantytown''), ''Violencia Gera Violencia'' (''Violence Breeds Violence'') and ''Eu Nao Sou Santo'' (''I'm No Saint''). In 1995, with Moreira da Silva and Dicro, fellow samba musicians, he made ''Os Tres Malandros -- In Concert,'' a parody of the Three Tenors. Three years ago, Mr. da Silva took his fans by surprise when he became an evangelical Christian. But he continued to sing the controversial lyrics that had made him famous, performing for sold-out crowds until a few months before he was hospitalized. Jose Bezerra da Silva is survived by his wife, Regina de Oliveira, and three sons from two previous relationships: Thalamy, Ulyssis and Leonardo, all of Rio."

She was 88. Miss Gold, who attended finishing school in Italy and joined the lively Paris scene in the 1930's, moved to Marseilles shortly after German forces invaded France in June 1940. There she began working with an Emergency Rescue Committee formed by an American journalist, Varian Fry, to aid thousands of refugees who had fled the Gestapo. Although Marseilles was in an area of southern France that was not seized by the Nazis until 1942, it was under the control of the collaborationist Vichy regime led by Marshal Philippe Petain. The committee's main goal was to get the refugees, many of them Jews, either to North Africa or through Spain to Portugal. From there, many could make it to the United States or Cuba. The committee, which included a former French official, Daniel Benedite, had its base in a crumbling chateau near Marseilles, where among others the Surrealist leader Andre Breton would hold court. ""With them was a handsome American girl, Mary Jayne Gold, who gave them vast sums of money for their noble work in which she also took a hand,"" Peggy Guggenheim wrote in her memoirs, ""Out of This Century,"" recalling that she visited the chateau as part of her own plan to finance the escape of several artists, including Max Ernst, whom she later married. ""Before I arrived Breton and Fry and Mary Jayne Gold and Benedite had been arrested and held incommunicado on a boat for days during Petain's visit to Marseilles,"" Miss Guggenheim said. ""They had finally managed to get a secret note to the American consul, who rescued them."" The United States did not declare war on Nazi Germany until 1941. Before Miss Gold and Fry were forced to leave Marseilles in 1941, the committee is reported to have arranged the escape of some 2,000 refugees, including the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz and the writer Hannah Arendt, by giving them false passports and leading them to escape routes, often across the Pyrenees. Miss Gold's money was crucial since visas and passports could be bought on the flourishing Marseilles black market. ""I was not there to witness the worst, only the beginning,"" Miss Gold wrote in her memoir, ""Crossroads Marseilles 1940,"" published by Doubleday in 1980. ""Even then, I was sometimes embarrassed into a sort of racialism -- like being ashamed of belonging to the human race."" The Associated Press quoted a friend, the filmmaker Pierre Sauvage, as saying that Miss Gold ""felt that only one year in her life really mattered and it was the year she spent in Marseilles."" He added, ""She was a very shrewd woman whose heart was on the right side of issues and who at a crucial turning point in history understood what was called for."" After the war, she returned to France and settled on the Riviera. She never married and had no children."
58101,"John Cooper Fitch, Glamorous Racer With a Flair for Danger, Dies at 95","He seemed bathed in golden sunlight, this John Cooper Fitch, who put on goggles and a polo helmet and drove racing cars as fast as anybody in the world, including his sometime partner, Stirling Moss.","He seemed bathed in golden sunlight, this John Cooper Fitch, who put on goggles and a polo helmet and drove racing cars as fast as anybody in the world, including his sometime partner, Stirling Moss. He shot a newly introduced German jet from the sky in World War II, raced yachts, built his own sports cars. Eva Peron, the legendary Evita, kissed him after he won the 1951 Grand Prix of Argentina. His friend George Barker, the poet, described him as ''a tall Jack with the sun on his wrist and a sky stuffed up his sleeve.'' Mr. Fitch, a lanky, graceful man who died on Monday at 95, put it more simply: ''I've always needed to go fast.'' Sometimes it seemed Mr. Fitch was trying to outdistance time itself. At 70, he set a speed record -- for driving backward, reaching 60 miles per hour at Lime Rock Park, the track he helped build in Connecticut. As a race driver Mr. Fitch lived with his wife, the former Elizabeth Huntley, in an apartment in Paris, a villa in northern Italy and a house in Switzerland. After the war he settled in Palm Beach, Fla., and hobnobbed with Orville Wright, Nol Coward and lots of Kennedys. He and his wife later settled in his family's 19-room ancestral 18th-century house in Salisbury, Conn. As glamorous as his racing life was -- Mr. Fitch led Corvette's first racing team and was the only American to join Mercedes's fabled stable of drivers -- his greatest achievement can be found on public highways. He invented the Fitch Inertial Barrier, a cluster of plastic barrels filled with varying amounts of sand that progressively slow and cushion a car in a crash. Devised in the 1960s and commonly positioned at exit ramps and abutments along interstates, the barrier is believed to have saved more than 17,000 lives. His patent for that invention is one of 15 he owned, most of them for safety improvements for motor racing and driving on highways. A notable exception is his patent for a system for steering hot-air balloons. A college dropout, Mr. Fitch said he had learned just enough engineering to accomplish what he wanted to accomplish. His genes could not have hurt: an ancestor invented the first plow on wheels during the Revolutionary War, and his great-great-grandfather John Fitch invented the steamboat. A grandfather, Asa Fitch, made a fortune from Fitch's Chewing Gum, which he invented in his kitchen. His father, Robert, was an early builder of horseless carriages in Indiana. John Cooper Fitch was born in Indianapolis on Aug. 4, 1917. His parents divorced when he was 6, and his mother married George Spindler, president of the Stutz Motor Car Company. An amateur racecar driver, Mr. Spindler took young John for spins on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He attended military school and studied civil engineering at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania for a year. Answering the call of the open road, he bought an Indian motorcycle and rode it to New Orleans, where he traded it for a Fiat 500 automobile and drove it to New York, stopping only for gas. In 1939, he used a small inheritance to hop a freighter for Europe and found his way to London, where he fell in love with a ballet dancer and lived with Communist intellectuals in grain barges on the Thames. Enlisting in the Army Air Forces in 1941, he went on to fly a P-51 Mustang and shot down a German Messerschmitt Me 262, the first operational jet fighter, as it was taking off. He was later shot down himself and spent three months in P.O.W. camps. After the war, as a member of Palm Beach society, he started racing yachts. He liked to tell the story of how he met the Duke of Windsor at one soiree: they were relieving themselves on a bush at the time. The duke became a friend. Mr. Fitch had fallen in love with sports cars when he saw a race in England, and after briefly selling them at a Mercedes-Benz dealership he opened in White Plains, he began racing an MG roadster on Long Island. In 1951 he won the Argentina race in an Allard sports car powered by a Cadillac V-8 engine and went on to win 12 of 13 races in the United States. The Sports Car Club of America anointed him its first national champion. He soon caught the attention of Briggs Cunningham, a wealthy sportsman who was a dominant force in sports-car racing and who went on to skipper the winning yacht in the 1958 America's Cup race. In 1953, Mr. Fitch won the second 12-hour endurance race in Sebring, Fla., in a Chrysler-powered car designed by Mr. Cunningham. Speed Age magazine named him Sports Car Driver of 1953. Mr. Fitch was soon recruited to join the Mercedes-Benz racing team, which was using victories on the track to help propel the company to a postwar resurgence. Other team members were Juan Manuel Fangio and Mr. Moss, one of the world's elite drivers. Mr. Fitch teamed with Mr. Moss to win the Royal Automobile Club's Tourist Trophy in 1955 in Northern Ireland. The same year, on June 11, Mr. Fitch was teamed with Pierre Levegh in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Ten minutes before Mr. Fitch was to take over the car, it went out of control, veered into the crowd and burst into flames, killing Mr. Levegh and more than 80 spectators in the most catastrophic accident in motor sports history. The horror of the crash motivated Mr. Fitch to develop safety barriers, including one for the walls of racetracks to deflect a car and soften its impact. For the highway barrier, he began with liquor crates, filling them with different amounts of sand and then crashing into them himself at speeds of up to 70 m.p.h. to figure out what worked best. In addition to saving lives, the Fitch Inertial Barrier -- typically consisting of yellow sand-filled plastic barrels -- saves an estimated $400 million a year in property damage and medical expenses, the National Science Foundation says. Mr. Fitch also invented, for racecars, a troughlike seat with helmet to reduce brain injuries and an apparatus for hospital beds to relieve disk pressure while allowing freedom of movement. In the 1960s, as a consultant to General Motors, Mr. Fitch designed gear to modify the Chevrolet Corvair, a compact car with an engine in the rear, to create a sportier touring car called the Sprint. As many as 100,000 were sold. He then designed a true racing car, the Phoenix, modeled on the Corvair. Only one prototype was built before Chevrolet abandoned the Corvair altogether for safety reasons in the face of opposition from the consumer advocate Ralph Nader. But the look of the Phoenix was said to have influenced that of the Corvette Stingray. After Mercedes left racing in 1955, Mr. Fitch led Chevrolet's mid-1950s effort to make the Corvette a serious contender in racing. He began by setting a land speed record for the car's class at Daytona Beach in Florida, exceeding 145 m.p.h. He raced competitively until 1966. Mr. Fitch helped develop the Lime Rock Park racecourse in Lakeville, Conn., carving it out of a potato field, and then managed it. His friend Paul Newman raced there. Mr. Fitch lived in Lakeville and died at his home there, having been treated for Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare skin cancer, and respiratory ailments, his son Stephen said. Mr. Fitch developed automotive products like a gasoline additive and formed companies to market them. He was named to a half-dozen automotive halls of fame. He commented on automotive issues, noting in 1997 that the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car crash might have been prevented had Parisian traffic engineers installed a guardrail. Mr. Fitch's wife, Elizabeth, died in 2009. Besides his son Stephen, he is survived by two other sons, John and Christopher, and six grandchildren. In 2005 Mr. Fitch, at 88, went to the Bonneville salt flats in Utah to try to break the land speed record for the class of sports car he had driven so successfully many years before. But his car, an invigorated Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing, had engine trouble, and he fell short of his 170-m.p.h. goal and the record. In the blur of motion that was his life, Mr. Fitch could be philosophical, as he was when an interviewer long ago asked him why men feel driven to drive fast. ''I suppose we have this hero impulse,'' he said."

He was 70 and lived in Harahan, La., a suburb of New Orleans. The cause was cancer, his family said. Mr. Mouton was an innovator known for his cost-effective yet aesthetically pleasing structures. He was known internationally for his design and construction of long-span space frame steel structures and modular prestressed concrete buildings. That part of his work was shown in the ""Engineers of the Century"" exhibit at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris in 1997. But Mr. Mouton was best known locally for developing a technique for driving deep pilings through New Orleans' soft ground and anchoring them in the hard ground deep below. The method gave the city its first skyscraper much taller than the 30 floors or so to which buildings there had been limited. That was the 45-story Plaza Tower Building, built by Mr. Mouton in the early 1960's. Mr. Mouton undertook more than 500 building projects during his career, among them the 384-foot-wide Cajundome in his native Lafayette, La., and the American Sugar Dome in Boston, featured in a ""20th Century Engineering"" exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1964. His other large designs included a ""spaceplane"" hangar for NASA, 18 B-2 bomber hangars for the United States Air Force and flood control projects for the Army Corps of Engineers. He held about 20 patents, including one for erosion control concepts for Louisiana's wetlands. Mr. Mouton received his bachelor's and master's degrees in civil engineering at Tulane. He joined the faculty in 1958, the year he received his master's degree, became a full professor in 1969 and retired in 1998. Throughout, he maintained a private practice as a consulting engineer. At his death, he was a practicing registered civil engineer and chief engineer at a coastal engineering and environmental consulting firm in New Orleans. He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Elizabeth Martin Mouton; two daughters, Mary E. Mouton of New Orleans and Dr. Stephanie M.

In the movie, Godzilla is brought back to life by nuclear testing in the Pacific and runs roughshod over big buildings. In later films, he defends Japan against various threats, although he is neither good nor evil, just accustomed to smashing anything in his way. Toho said Mr. Honda, whose interest quickly turned to special effects, directed 45 films from 1951 to 1975, including about a dozen monster movies, including ""King Kong vs. Godzilla."""
36107,"Warren Harding, 77, Early Rock Climber Who Became Legend","Warren J. Harding, a legend among rock climbing aficionados since his years of dogged assaults on the towering ramparts of Yosemite Valley, died Feb. 27 at his home in the mountain and lake country near Anderson, Calif.","Warren J. Harding, a legend among rock climbing aficionados since his years of dogged assaults on the towering ramparts of Yosemite Valley, died Feb. 27 at his home in the mountain and lake country near Anderson, Calif. He was 77. He began climbing in the early 1950's, when popular interest in the activity was in its infancy. He continued through the 1970's, making 30 first ascents in Yosemite National Park. By then rock climbing was evolving from an esoteric pursuit into a sport. Since the 1980's it has attracted hundreds of thousands of devotees, with international competitions, crowds of spectators and prize money. Mr. Harding attracted notice when he took part in the first conquest of El Capitan, a stark granite monolith rising 3,600 feet. On their way up, Mr. Harding and two companions, George Whitmore and Wayne Merry, retreated for a while to a perch on a narrow ledge at 2,100 feet. Fighting frost, they went on carving footholds at night by the light of miners' headlamps. The party reached El Capitan's summit in freezing weather on Nov. 12, 1958. Mr. Harding was first over the rim after a 24-hour struggle past what he called a ferocious overhang. The ascent, via an approach called the Nose, had taken 13 days, after more than a year of preparation. In 1970, Mr. Harding, then 46, and another climber, Dean Caldwell, drew a national audience as they edged up El Capitan's southeast face. They had planned to spend 12 days scaling the rock face, known as the Wall of the Early Morning Light. While hundreds had made it up the monolith by then, none had ventured that way. They maneuvered past the Great Roof, a 15-foot overhang, but a rainstorm pinned them to the rock day after day. The feat turned into a marathon followed daily by the news media across the country. They ran short of food but waved off rescue by the National Park Service. The weather finally turned splendidly autumnal, and the pair, bearded and grinning, completed their conquest on the 27th day. ""I feel great,"" Mr. Harding said as the men hugged their friends and enjoyed fried chicken and Champagne provided by a greeting party. Not all climbers approved of Mr. Harding's techniques. Scaling sheer rock formations, he used the traditional spikes for safety ropes, but he also drilled holes for expansion bolts on blank stretches, a more controversial practice because it damages the rock. Warren Harding, who was called Batso for hanging off rock walls like a bat, was born in Oakland, Calif. In World War II he was a propeller mechanic in Sacramento. Later, he was a surveyor, first for the state and then in private construction before retiring in 1985. His home was something of a mecca for the new generation of rock climbers. He is survived by a sister, Ardeth Barker of West Sacramento. Climbing magazine eulogized Mr. Harding as ""Yosemite's venerated master of wine, women and walls."" It said that in recent months ""many of his friends from the Golden Age of Yosemite"" had come to call, including his old climbing partner Mr. Whitmore."
6754,"Momcilo Djujic, Serbian Priest and Warrior, Dies at 92","Momcilo Djujic, a Serbian warrior-priest who fought as a Chetnik commander in epic World War II battles in Yugoslavia, died Saturday at a hospice in San Diego.","Momcilo Djujic, a Serbian warrior-priest who fought as a Chetnik commander in epic World War II battles in Yugoslavia, died Saturday at a hospice in San Diego. He was 92. Mr. Djujic, who lived in San Marcos, Calif., was in the view of some Serbs the last great ""Vojvoda,"" the designation in Serbia for a military commander distinguished by bravery, devotion to the Orthodox Church and loyalty to the now exiled monarchy. The title of ""Vojvoda"" was conferred on Mr. Djujic in June 1942, by Gen. Dragoljub (Draza) Mihailovic, the commander of the royalist Chetniks, after Mr. Djujic had already been fighting Nazi Germans, Croatian Fascists and Communist Partisans for a year in the mountains and valleys of his native region on the border between Croatia and northwestern Bosnia. So fierce was the fighting in Yugoslavia in World War II that Mr. Djujic, a tall, bearded commander in traditional black lambswool cap with a skull and crossbones insignia, never met General Mihailovic during the war because they were in different combat zones. They had begun fighting Axis forces almost simultaneously in the months after Hitler's invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, an invasion that unleashed brutal ethnic, religious and political rivalries among the country's Serbs, Muslims and Croats. A few weeks into the war, Croatian nationalist forces surrounded the home of Mr. Djujic, a priest. He grabbed a rifle, escaped across the mountains with his family and found refuge in the hills above the Croatian coast. By July 1941 he had organized a Chetnik uprising in northwestern Bosnia, seizing the city of Drvar from the Ustashe, as the Croatian fascists were known. The revolt soon spread to neighboring Croatia's coastal region, Dalmatia. How was it to strip off his priest's cassock and become a warrior? ""That decision didn't come easily,"" he said in 1990, ""but the forests were full of refugees and I could see the Ustashe in front of my nose in my parish. The people were crying, they needed deliverance."" In March 1942, Chetnik officers brought Mr. Djujic a radio transmitter. He battled on, and for a short time boasted of holding all of Dalmatia. A 1942 letter from General Mihailovic praised and thanked him for his ""gigantic efforts,"" recognized by the later award of high royal decorations. His acts of wartime bravery included the rescue of six American airmen shot down over Yugoslavia. But he also encountered charges that he collaborated with Communists and the Ustashe on occasion -- both sworn enemies of the royalist Serbian Chetniks -- and in 1946 Tito's Communist Government branded him a war criminal on charges of being responsible for the death of 1,500 people during the war. Mr. Djujic said later, ""I never made a compromise, never an agreement, either with the Communists or the Ustashe."" Momcilo Djujic (pronounced mahm-CHEE-lo JOO-yich) was born Feb. 27, 1907, in the village of Kovacic, in the region known as Tromedja, or junction, where Croatia meets northwestern Bosnia and their mixed populations of Serbs and Croats converged. He attended high school in the Croatian coastal city of Sibenik but at 22 went to the Orthodox theological seminary in Sremski Karlovci, graduating in 1931. Consecrated a priest, he was assigned to a parish near his birthplace. There his passionate sermons soon won him the the nickname Pop Vatra -- ""Father Fire."" Mr. Djujic's first and only encounter with Draza Mihailovic came when the body of King Alexander, who was assassinated in Marseilles in 1934, passed through the priest's native region. Mr. Djujic was chosen to stand by the coffin as the funeral train proceeded. Anticipating future ethnic conflict, Mr. Djujic met after the King's death with a Serbian paramilitary leader and the president of the Chetnik movement, Kosta Pecanac. With their assistance, even before war erupted, he organized and began to arm 11 Chetnik bands in his region. ""I knew that the country would not survive,"" he said later, ""because nobody can put Serbs and Croats in the same bag."" His toughest moment in battle, he said, was on Dec. 3, 1944, battling Communist Partisans in Dalmatia. His men were outnumbered five to one. Losses were heavy on both sides. ""It was also a big victory,"" Mr. Djujic recalled, ""because Tito gave his general an order to take me alive. Later the Partisan general wrote: 'Though we had the strongest forces, Djujic slipped away from us like a fish through our hands.' "" As the war ended, Mr. Djujic hoped to combine with other anti-Tito forces to build a kind of redoubt in northern Yugoslavia. Instead, he was ordered by Allied forces to surrender. His division was taken to southern Italy, from there to Germany and then dispersed to European countries, the United States and Australia. Mr. Djujic was in Paris from 1947 to 1949, then moved to the United States, where he became active in Serbian emigre circles and the Orthodox Church, although not serving as a priest. He enraged some emigre Serbs when he endorsed a church Patriarch in Belgrade authorized by the Communists, but remained strongly inimical to Tito. Finally he retired to San Marcos, writing poems and jokes published in America and Serbia. In 1989 he declared Vojislav Seselj, then an anti-Communist dissident, a Serbian ""Vojvoda."" Mr. Seselj is now head of the Radical Party and a government coalition partner of President Slobodan Milosevic. ""I was naive when I nominated Seselj Vojovoda,"" Mr. Djujic said in 1998. ""I ask my people to forgive me. The greatest gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan Milosevic."" He is survived by his sons, Sinisa, of Redondo Beach, and Radivoje, of Santa Monica; a daughter, Radojka Kinach, of San Marcos; two granddaughters and four great-grandchildren; a brother, Bosko, of Torrance, Calif., and a sister, Ika Djuric, of Escondido, Calif. His wife, Zorka, died in 1995. http://www.nytimes.com"

He was 56 and lived in Sonoma County. He died of pneumonia at Kentfield Rehabilitation Hospital, where he had been for about a month, said the band's longtime manager, Bruce Cohn. Mr. Knudsen, who according to the band's Web site began drumming in the eighth grade, joined the classic rock band in 1974 after he met Mr. Cohn, who told him the Doobies needed a drummer. ''After a week's rehearsal, I went on the road with the band,'' Mr. Knudsen said in his biography on the band's Web site. The Doobies, whose hits include ''Black Water,'' ''Minute by Minute,'' ''What a Fool Believes'' and ''Taking It to the Streets,'' were known for incorporating gospel and jazz stylings into popular hit songs. They also were well regarded for their live performances. Mr. Knudsen played with the Doobies until the band's 1982 farewell tour. During the band's hiatus, Mr. Knudsen and a bandmate, John McFee, formed the country-rock group Southern Pacific, which released four albums and had several hits. He rejoined the band full time in 1993. Mr. Knudsen is survived by his wife of 16 years, Kate, and their daughter, Dayna Keyes."
32207,"Thomas Reddin, 88, Who Led Los Angeles Police in 1960's","Thomas Reddin, a former police chief of Los Angeles who helped modernize the department and introduced community policing, died on Saturday at his home in Los Angeles.","LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5 Thomas Reddin, a former police chief of Los Angeles who helped modernize the department and introduced community policing, died on Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 88. The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his granddaughter Amber Reddin said. Mr. Reddin began his career in the Los Angeles Police Department in 1941 and was chief from February 1967 until he resigned in May 1969 to become a television newscaster. He was in the police chief's job at the time of the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy at the old Ambassador Hotel here in 1968. He was credited with upgrading the department's dispatch and communication systems and improving training and pay, as well as with linking officers with community partners in what is now called community policing. ''He was one of the first really progressive people in law enforcement,'' said Richard Mosk, a state appeals court associate justice and a friend of Mr. Reddin's. ''Tom Reddin was ahead of his time.'' Mitzi Grasso, a director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said Mr. Reddin was a ''master communicator'' committed to bringing new technologies into the department. ''It was through his leadership that the L.A.P.D. developed a sophisticated 911 dispatching system,'' Ms. Grasso said. Born in New York City, Mr. Reddin lived in Oklahoma and Denver as a child. He enrolled at University of Colorado but dropped out for lack of money and served four years in the Navy. After moving to Los Angeles, Mr. Reddin was robbed while managing a service station. Impressed by the police response, he joined the force and rose steadily through the ranks, becoming deputy chief under William H. Parker in 1960. Mr. Reddin was at the helm in 1967 when the police clashed violently with thousands of antiwar protesters who had gathered outside the Century Plaza Hotel, where President Lyndon B. Johnson was being honored. Scores of people were hurt and more than 50 arrested after the police, armed with nightsticks, moved in to break up the demonstration. In 1968, after Robert Kennedy was assassinated, Mr. Reddin was credited with taking steps to ensure the safety of the suspect, Sirhan Sirhan, so he could face trial. According to a Time magazine article, a patrolman's pickup truck with a camper shell was used to transport Mr. Sirhan discreetly from the police station to an unannounced court session. After leaving the department, Mr. Reddin became a newscaster for KTLA-TV, where he earned about four times the $32,800 he made as police chief. He was a candidate for mayor in 1973 but came in fourth in a crowded race won by Tom Bradley, a city councilman and former Los Angeles police lieutenant. Mr. Reddin is survived by his wife, Betty Jane; a son, Michael; a daughter, Nancy Kienholz; eight grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and a great-great grandchild. A memorial service is planned for next week at the Los Angeles Police Academy."
15462,"Hugh J. Davis, 69, Gynecologist Who Invented Dalkon Shield","Dr. Hugh J. Davis, the Johns Hopkins gynecologist whose acclaimed invention of the Dalkon Shield as a safer and more effective birth control device proved disastrous to thousands of American women, died on Wednesday at his home on Gibson Island, Md.","Dr. Hugh J. Davis, the Johns Hopkins gynecologist whose acclaimed invention of the Dalkon Shield as a safer and more effective birth control device proved disastrous to thousands of American women, died on Wednesday at his home on Gibson Island, Md. He was 69. His wife, Jytte, said the cause was pancreatic cancer. When it was introduced with considerable fanfare by the A. H. Robins pharmaceutical company in 1971, the Dalkon Shield was hailed as a scientific marvel, a highly improved intrauterine device, or IUD, promising almost perfect birth control protection with virtually no adverse side effects. At a time when headlines suggesting that birth control pills could pose serious long-term dangers had led many women to seek a safer alternative, the Dalkon Shield developed by Dr. Davis and his engineer partner, Irwin Lerner, seemed to be just what the doctor ordered. Indeed, it was. Within three and a half years the device had been prescribed for 2.2 million women, making it by far the most popular IUD and capturing 10 percent of the contraceptive market. Then the reports of infections, miscarriages and even deaths began coming in, and the once bright promise turned to dust. By the time the dust settled, Dr. Davis's invention had been deemed responsible for 18 deaths and more than 200,000 infections, miscarriages and other ailments. In addition, Robins, which stopped selling the devices in 1974 but did not order a recall of those previously sold, was eventually forced into bankruptcy by a wave of product liability suits and the discovery that the company had suppressed evidence that the device was neither as safe nor as effective as it had claimed in its nationwide ad campaign. After establishing a $2.5 billion fund to compensate women injured by the device, the company was sold in 1989 to American Home Products. A native of Puerto Rico, where his father worked as a government botanist, Dr. Davis was a precocious student who graduated from the Kent School in Connecticut and entered the University of Georgia at the age of 14. Interrupting his education, he worked as a reporter for The Atlanta Constitution, served in the Army in World War II and built houses in Florida before returning to Georgia for a degree in chemistry and biology and receiving his medical degree from Johns Hopkins in 1953. After his residency he spent three years at the National Cancer Center in Denmark, where his flair for invention blossomed. A pioneer in laparoscopy, he devised and patented more than 30 medical instruments used in abdominal surgery and developed a do-it-yourself kit for the detection of cervical cancer. Returning to the United States in 1962, he joined the Johns Hopkins faculty as a professor of gynecology and obstetrics and over the next few years became such a recognized expert on contraception that at the height of the scare over birth control pills he testified before a Senate subcommittee, warning that pills had created such a widespread hazard that it was medically unsound to prescribe them when safer alternatives were available. At the time of his testimony he had a professional interest in just such an alternative, the Dalkon Shield he and Mr. Lerner had developed. Later they sold it to Robins for $750,000 plus future royalties. Although there was initial suspicion that the crablike design of the five-pronged shield was somehow responsible for infecting and sometimes puncturing the uterus, it was eventually determined that the culprit was the nylon-sheathed tailstring used to remove the device or check that it was still in place. Because the string's bundle of tiny filaments was not sealed at the end and the sheathing tended to disintegrate, the tailstring was acting as a wick drawing vaginal bacteria up into the uterus. In the aftermath of the scandal, a Federal law was passed in 1976 requiring extensive testing and formal Food and Drug Administration approval before medical devices like IUD's can be put on the market. In the absence of such a law, Robins had introduced the Dalkon Shield on the basis of a yearlong test of 640 women conducted by Dr. Davis. Although he continued to stand by his design, the controversy brought an end to Dr. Davis's career and he retired in 1982. To some birth control experts, the most serious side effect of the Dalkon Shield has been the virtual demise of the IUD in the United States. At a time when more than 90 million women use IUD's around the world, fewer than 500,000 American women use them. In addition to his wife, Dr. Davis is survived by a daughter, Rikke Davis, of McLean, Va.; a son, Bruce, of Gibson Island, and a sister, Elaine Golden, of Panama City, Fla."
56217,"Paul Schaefer, 89, German Guilty of Chile Child Abuse","A former Nazi-era German soldier who founded a secretive German cult in southern Chile, where he sexually abused about 25 children, died of heart failure at a prison hospital early Saturday, Chilean officials said.","RIO DE JANEIRO -- A former Nazi-era German soldier who founded a secretive German cult in southern Chile, where he sexually abused about 25 children, died of heart failure at a prison hospital early Saturday, Chilean officials said. He was 89. The former soldier, Paul Schaefer, was serving a 20-year sentence for the sexual abuse of minors, but he was also under investigation for the 1985 disappearance of Boris Weisfeiler, an American citizen who vanished while on a hiking trip. The Chilean government said officially that Mr. Weisfeiler, then 43 years old, drowned while trying to ford a river. But State Department and C.I.A. reports that were later declassified indicated that he was probably kidnapped by Chilean state security forces, who then handed him over to Mr. Schaefer's heavily armed Colonia Dignidad religious sect based nearby. Dozens of opponents of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship were tortured at Colonia Dignidad, according to human rights groups. One military informant said that Mr. Weisfeiler, a Russian-born Jew, was held captive there, and that he was later tortured and executed. A former nurse from the Luftwaffe, Mr. Schaefer was forced to leave Germany after he was charged with sexually abusing young boys in an orphanage he ran there. In 1961 he founded Colonia Dignidad, an anti-Semitic apocalyptic religious sect about 225 miles south of Santiago. Early last decade it still had about 300 inhabitants, and it still exists but is referred to as Villa Baviera. Mr. Schaefer ran the sect with a heavy hand, banning almost all contact with the outside world, separating women from men and children from their parents, and controlling intimate contact. While he was never a hunted Nazi, Mr. Schaefer opened Colonia Dignidad for fugitive Nazis to hide out for periods of time. After Chile's courts began investigating Mr. Schaefer for sexual abuse charges in the late 1990s, he fled to Argentina, where he hid until he was found in 2005. After being returned to Chile, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sexually abusing 25 children. Mr. Schaefer was also sentenced to three years for violating weapons control law after a huge military arsenal was found on Colonia Dignidad grounds, to seven years for homicide and to three years for torture. The disappearance of Mr. Weisfeiler, who was a mathematics professor at Pennsylvania State University, continues to be an unsolved mystery, and Mr. Schafer was never charged in the case. Sebastian Pinera, Chile's president, said Saturday that while Mr. Schaefer now cannot be judged in court for additional crimes he was suspected of, ''there is another justice that never ends, which is divine justice.''"

She was 77. The cause was cancer, said John Knapp, her son-in-law. A versatile interpreter of classical and contemporary works in her performing career, Ms. Englund became increasingly known as a trainer of young dancers. Born in Birmingham, Ala., and a member of a socially prominent family there, Ms. Englund, who also had a home in Point Clear, Ala., always retained the manners of a well-bred Southern lady. Yet students soon realized that this aura of gentility concealed a determination to make them technically and stylistically correct. ABT II, the second company of American Ballet Theater, currently directed by Wes Chapman, is a troupe of 13 dancers ages 16 to 20. With patience, kindness and firmness, Ms. Englund helped prepare troupe members for the professional ballet world in American Ballet Theater or another company. Polio brought Ms. Englund to ballet. After she contracted the disease in childhood, a doctor suggested ballet training at a local school as a form of therapy. Ballet soon became her passion. She studied in New York with many teachers; in Paris with Lubov Egorova, a former member of the Maryinsky Ballet of St. Petersburg; and in Denmark with members of the Royal Danish Ballet. When the Ford Foundation began supporting dance in 1959, Gage Bush, as she was known then, received one of its first grants to study in New York at the School of American Ballet. The same year, she married the dancer and choreographer Richard Englund; their careers were entwined until his death in 1991. Ms. Englund joined the Joffrey Ballet in 1960 and American Ballet Theater in 1961. Then the Englunds went to Birmingham to direct the Birmingham Ballet, which soon became a leading regional company. They returned to the New York area in 1967 to lead the Huntington Dance Ensemble, which, sponsored by the Huntington Performing Arts Foundation on Long Island, presented school performances and programs for the general public. In 1970, Richard Englund founded the touring group Dance Repertory Company, which was renamed Ballet Repertory Company in 1972 and which then toured under the auspices of American Ballet Theater. It became American Ballet Theater II in 1981. As a principal dancer with that stylistically diverse group, Ms. Englund appeared in productions of classically scintillating divertissements like ''Raymonda'' and ''La Malinche,'' Jose Limon's dramatic modern-dance piece about the Spanish conquest of Mexico, in which Ms. Englund played an earthy peasant. In 1985, Richard Englund became director of the Joffrey II Dancers, the Joffrey Ballet's second company, and Ms. Englund was appointed ballet mistress, a post she held until the company disbanded. She returned to American Ballet Theater in 1995 as ballet mistress of ABT II, then known as the ABT Studio Company. Ms. Englund is survived by two daughters, Alixandra Gage Englund, a theatrical designer, and Rachel Rutherford Englund Knapp, who, as Rachel Rutherford, is a soloist with the New York City Ballet. An honorary member of American Ballet Theater's board of directors, Ms. Englund in 1997 helped establish the American Ballet Theater Summer Intensive at the University of Alabama, the first training institute to be offered by American Ballet Theater at a university and outside New York. A scholarship program has been endowed by the Alabama intensive in her honor."

He was 92. Mr. Findlay, whose full name was Walstein Chester Findlay Jr., was born in 1903 in Kansas City, Mo., the son and grandson of art dealers. His grandfather William Wadsworth Findlay founded Findlay Galleries there in 1870, selling art supplies, picture frames and some paintings. His son expanded the business to include the paintings and sculpture of such Western artists as Frederic Remington and Charles Russell. In the mid-1920's Wally Findlay left the University of Missouri in Columbia and joined the family in the gallery. In 1932 he moved to Chicago and opened his own Findlay Galleries, stocking art, silver and picture frames. In 1961 Mr. Findlay added a second gallery in Palm Beach, where President John F. Kennedy planned to have a Winter White House. In 1963 he opened the Findlay Galleries on East 57th Street in Manhattan, which became the opulent setting for flamboyant openings for socially prominent artists. In addition to selling the works of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and modern artists, Mr. Findlay handled the wall-size flower paintings of Jane Pickens Langley, who would marry Walter Hoving, president of Tiffany & Company. He also represented Marylou Whitney, who did primitive paintings, and her husband Cornelius Vanderbilt (Sonny) Whitney, who painted big hunting scenes. After a legal dispute with his brother David and younger Findlays over the use of the name Findlay Galleries, Mr. Findlay changed its name to the Wally Findlay Galleries. (Three other family members operate their own galleries in Manhattan). In the 1970's he also ran galleries in Beverly Hills, Calif., and in Tokyo. He franchised his operations in 1980, but the franchise defaulted in 1984 and Mr. Findlay bought back the business. Late last year, he sold the East 57th Street building that housed the Wally Findlay Galleries. He recently reopened the gallery on East 60th Street near Madison Avenue. No immediate family members survive."
4459,"Chick Hearn, 85, the Voice Of the Los Angeles Lakers","Chick Hearn, the radio and television voice of the Los Angeles Lakers for 42 seasons, whose vivid broadcast phrases were credited with adding ""slam dunk"" and ""air ball"" to the lexicon of professional baskeball, died Monday night at Northridge Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles.","Chick Hearn, the radio and television voice of the Los Angeles Lakers for 42 seasons, whose vivid broadcast phrases were credited with adding ""slam dunk"" and ""air ball"" to the lexicon of professional baskeball, died Monday night at Northridge Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 85. The cause was complications from a head injury sustained last Friday in a fall in the backyard of his home. He had a brain hemorrhage and, despite two operations to relieve swelling and remove blood clots, he fell into a coma, his doctors said. The only regular play-by-play broadcaster the Lakers had after moving from Minneapolis for the 1960-61 season, Mr. Hearn called a record 3,338 consecutive Lakers games over 36 years -- from Nov. 21, 1965, the day after bad weather forced him to miss a flight, to Dec. 16, 2001, after which he had surgery for a blocked heart valve. While recovering, he fell and broke his hip, but returned to work on April 9 and broadcast the Lakers' playoff run to their third straight National Basketball Association championship. He had planned to continue broadcasting through next season. With Marty Glickman, who announced for the Knicks, and Johnny Most, the longtime gravel voice of the Boston Celtics, Mr. Hearn was a pioneer in sports broadcasting, as well known to Lakers fans as Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal and other stars whose exploits he chronicled. With dazzling imagery and a deep resonance reflecting early work in radio, Mr. Hearn caught rapid-fire action: ""Magic back and forth like a windshield wiper with the dribble drive. . . . He throws up a prayer: air ball! Rebound left side taken by McAdoo, he goes right back up -- a frozen rope that time, no arch, but it melted right in the hole. . . . Lucas fakes and puts James Worthy deep into the popcorn machine. He's covered with salt!"" Mr. Hearn's ""slam dunk"" was coined to describe the power of a monstrous basket stuff by the 7-foot-1-inch Chamberlain, according to ""The Language of Sport,"" by Tim Considine; the phrase has been picked up in other contexts to convey forcefulness. ""Air ball,"" a shot that misses everything, and ""The mustard's off the hot dog,"" a flashy play going awry, were other Hearnisms. Francis Dayle Hearn was born in Buda, Ill., on Nov. 27, 1916, but grew up in Aurora. He was a talented athlete as a young man, but a car accident ended his semipro basketball career in the 1930's. During his Aurora playing days, his affable response to a practical joker's dead chicken in his locker won him the nickname Chick, and it stuck. He was a pharmaceutical salesman for a time, served in the Army in the South Pacific during World War II and after the war became a sportscaster in Aurora and Peoria, Ill. In 1956, he moved to Los Angeles to cover college football and basketball for CBS radio and NBC television outlets. Joining the Lakers in their first season in Los Angeles, he was soon the toast of sports entertainment in Southern California. He eventually became the voice for nine N.B.A. championships. Pat Riley, the celebrated coach, spent two years beside Hearn in the broadcast booth, and credited Hearn with being his early mentor. Hearn also broadcast college and professional football, track meets, auto and horse racing, boxing, tennis, golf and other sports, and appeared in television and movie cameos, usually as a broadcaster. For seven years in the 1970's, he was an assistant general manager of the Lakers, advising on contracts and personnel. He was a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame and the American Sportscasters Hall of Fame. Last June, accepting a Los Angeles Emmy for lifetime achievement, he told his audience he had never been a Laker cheerleader. ""My main objective when I get behind the microphone is to entertain, yes, but to be honest,"" he said. ""If Jerry West threw the ball up in the second row and hit some old lady drinking a beer, that's tough. You got to report it."" He is survived by his wife, the former Marge Jeffers; one granddaughter; and one great-granddaughter. A son, Gary, died in 1972, and a daughter, Samantha, died in 1991."

25422,"Claude Sitton, 89, Acclaimed Civil Rights Reporter, Dies","Claude Sitton, a son of the South whose unwavering coverage of the civil rights movement for The New York Times through most of that tumultuous era was hailed as a benchmark of 20th-century journalism, died on Tuesday in Atlanta.","Claude Sitton, a son of the South whose unwavering coverage of the civil rights movement for The New York Times through most of that tumultuous era was hailed as a benchmark of 20th-century journalism, died on Tuesday in Atlanta. He was 89. The cause was congestive heart failure, his son Clint said. Mr. Sitton had been in a hospice. In later years Mr. Sitton won a Pulitzer Prize as a columnist for The News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., where he was also the editor. But it was in the crucible of the Jim Crow South that he forged his most enduring legacy. Roaming the region as a reporter from May 1958 to October 1964, Mr. Sitton was an eyewitness to one of the most wrenching but consequential episodes in American history, often spending weeks on the road, flying home to Atlanta for a night, then heading out again the next day. By the end of those six and a half years he had written almost 900 articles, some analytical and steeped in his knowledge of the South, many drawn from on-the-scene reporting. They recounted the strategizing by civil rights leaders in the courts and on the ground, explored the political dynamics of race in the statehouses and at the White House, and opened readers' eyes to the violence with which the movement was often met -- the beatings, bombings and church burnings. He often portrayed the struggle through the individuals who gave it flesh: the demonstrators, freedom riders and ordinary Southern blacks who braved white mobs, brutal police officers and segregationist public officials simply to get an education or to vote. When Turner Catledge, the Mississippi-born managing editor of The Times, chose Mr. Sitton to cover the South in 1958, ''he was about to set in motion a level of reporting that would establish the national standard for two decades,'' Gene Roberts and Hank Klibanoff wrote in 2006 in their Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ''The Race Beat: The Press, the Civil Rights Struggle and the Awakening of a Nation.'' (Mr. Roberts was himself a managing editor of The Times.) ''Nobody in the news business,'' the authors continued, ''would have as much impact as he would -- on the reporting of the civil rights movement, on the federal government's response, or on the movement itself. Sitton's byline would be atop the stories that landed on the desks of three presidents.'' One of his articles, in 1962, caught the attention of Robert F. Kennedy, the attorney general at the time. It described a south Georgia sheriff and his deputies intruding on a voting rights meeting at a church in Terrell County and menacing the citizens there. One officer repeatedly struck his palm with a large flashlight as if it were a club; another ran his hand over his revolver and cartridge belt. Mr. Sitton began by quoting the sheriff: ''We want our colored people to go on living like they have for the last hundred years.'' Kennedy sent a Justice Department team to Terrell County to sue the sheriff two weeks later. ''It was not that Claude was some flaming liberal or liberator,'' Mr. Klibanoff told The Associated Press in an interview. ''He just liked a good story and liked to have it first. And frequently he was reporting on injustice -- and they knew, on the civil rights side, that if The New York Times wrote about it, it would get attention from important people.'' Mr. Sitton covered the Little Rock school desegregation upheaval in 1958-59, after Gov. Orval E. Faubus of Arkansas ordered the city's schools closed. He was there on June 11, 1963, when Gov. George C. Wallace fulfilled his campaign pledge to ''stand in the schoolhouse door'' before stepping aside when handed a presidential order to allow two black students to enroll at the University of Alabama. And he was on the first bus carrying Freedom Riders out of Montgomery, Ala., on May 24, 1961, as it headed toward Jackson, Miss. That bus trip was a three-day exception he had been granted after being barred from setting foot in Alabama -- not by Alabama officials but, to his intense frustration, by the Times's lawyers and top editors. The order was a cautionary response to two libel lawsuits that had been brought by Alabama officials (neither involving Mr. Sitton). The Times eventually won both cases, one of them eliciting a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in Times v. Sullivan, setting the precedent that public officials cannot receive damages for criticism of their official performance unless they can prove actual malice. Only after Governor Wallace was elected in November 1962 and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. declared Birmingham a new focus of the civil rights struggle was Mr. Sitton allowed to step again on Alabama soil after two and a half years. But there was no dearth of news elsewhere in the South. He was in Oxford, Miss., on Sept. 30, 1962, when James H. Meredith, a black Air Force veteran, was admitted to the University of Mississippi. He wrote of the all-night riots on campus in which two people were killed. After Medgar Evers, another civil rights leader, was shot to death outside his home in Jackson on June 12, 1963, enraged demonstrators took to the city's streets. The next day, Mr. Sitton's article on the front page of The Times described how police officers had charged demonstrators who were chanting ''We want freedom!'' and clubbed them into submission. ''Six Negroes were struck or choked by police nightsticks drawn across their throats,'' he wrote. Mr. Sitton would sometimes report what he observed and interpret it plainly without qualifiers or the filter of a quoted voice. In Oxford in 1963, he wrote, ''Racists here, as elsewhere, have underscored this principle: The rights of dissent and freedom of association -- which they so frequently invoke for themselves -- do not extend to those who disagree with them.'' He could be evocative in his writing, as he was in a dispatch from 1963, datelined Greenwood, Miss. ''The night of Feb. 28 was mild with a hint of early spring as the black sedan rolled westward along U.S. Route 82 across the Mississippi Delta,'' he began. ''One of its three Negro occupants recalled later that as a string of traffic faded to the rear near Itta Bena, a car that had trailed them from Greenwood pulled alongside. Two white men sat in front, one in back. ''Bursts of gunfire rang out. Thirteen .45 caliber bullets stitched a ragged seam of finger-sized holes along the sedan's left side and a copper-jacketed slug burned into the driver's shoulder to within an inch of his spine.'' In the so-called Freedom Summer of 1964, hundreds of college students from around the country went to Mississippi to register blacks to vote. On the night of June 21, 1964, three volunteers -- Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman -- were stopped by the police near Philadelphia, Miss., taken to jail and released. Then they disappeared. Forty-four days passed before their bodies were found in the mud of an earthen dam. All three had been shot to death. Mr. Sitton wrote 13 articles about the search for the bodies and their discovery. Describing the coverage of Freedom Summer, Newsweek magazine said: ''One reporter stood above the rest. The best daily newspaperman on the Southern scene is the Atlanta-based Sitton.'' Claude Fox Sitton was born in Atlanta on Dec. 4, 1925, one of two sons of Claude and Pauline Sitton. His great-grandfather had been a tax collector for the Confederacy, a slave owner and mayor of Pendleton, N.C. His father was a railroad conductor who bought a farm during the Depression, outside of Conyers, Ga. Young Claude worked beside black sharecroppers there. After graduating from high school in 1943, he joined the Navy and served in the Pacific. Home from the war, he earned a bachelor's degree from Emory University in Atlanta in 1949 and worked for the International News Service and United Press. In 1953, he married Eva Whetstone, who survives him. Besides his son Clint, he is also survived by two daughters, Lea Stanley and Suzanna Greene; another son, Mac; and nine grandchildren. Mr. Sitton left journalism in 1955 to become a press attach for the United States Information Agency in Ghana. But two years later he was hired by The Times as a copy editor. After nine months on the copy desk, he was asked by Mr. Catledge to return to the South. He came back to New York in the fall of 1964, after Freedom Summer, having been named national editor of The Times. He soon instituted a rule that a staff reporter must cover Dr. King wherever he went. Earl Caldwell, a Times correspondent, was in Memphis on April 4, 1968, when Dr. King was assassinated. Several weeks later, Mr. Sitton left The Times to become editor of The News & Observer, a post that he held until 1990. For many years, while editor, he wrote a Sunday column in which he continued to focus on civil rights but also on other topics, like the environment and public education. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1983. He also received a 1991 George Polk Award for career achievement. That he returned to the South after his years with The Times did not surprise his colleagues. He had never lost his emotional bond with the South, nor his drawl, for that matter. And for a reporter covering the region for a Northern newspaper, a drawl could come in handy. Roy Reed, a Times reporter hired by Mr. Sitton in 1965 to help cover the South, told how Mr. Sitton was once confronted by a group of menacing young men in Philadelphia, Miss. ''One of these young toughs said, 'Who are you?' '' Mr. Reed said in an interview. ''And Claude, in his thick South Georgia accent, responded, 'I'm with The New York Times.' '' ''These guys thought this was patently ridiculous,'' Mr. Reed said. ''They laughed and walked away.''"

She was 87. Ms. Dunnigan was born in Hollywood and grew up in San Francisco. She attended Principia College in St. Louis. After a brief career in the theater, which included an appearance on Broadway in ""The Lord Blesses the Bishop"" in 1934, Ms. Dunnigan turned to teaching speech and then to translation. Her love for the writings of Chekhov led her to study Russian, after which she translated not only Chekhov but works by Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. Her Chekhov translations included ""Selected Stories"" (1960), ""The Major Plays (1964) and ""Ward Six and Other Stories""(1965). Tennessee Willilams based his play ""The Notebook of Trigorin"" on Ms. Dunnigan's translation of Chekhov's ""Seagull."" Ms. Dunnigan also translated Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" (1968) as well as Ilya Tolstoy's reminiscence, ""Tolstoy, My Father"" (1971), and Dostoyevsky's ""Netochka Nezvanova"" (1970). She also served as an editor of translations for the Journal of Soviet Studies during the 1960's. In 1978 Ms. Dunnigan threatened to sue the playwright Jean-Claude van Itallie over his version of Chekhov's ""Cherry Orchard,"" which she said had been taken ""word for word"" from her own translation of the play. In an out-of-court settlement, the theatrical publisher Samuel French halted printing, sale and distribution of the van Itallie text. Another publisher, Grove Press, also agreed to withdraw its copies of the van Itallie version. Ms. Dunnigan returned to the theater one final time, in 1982, when she appeared in a New York Shakespeare Festival production of ""Antigone"" at the Public Theater. She is survived by a son, John Stearns of Manhattan, and a brother, Richard Dunnigan of Sacramento, Calif."

Whitman, a real estate developer who was hailed as a visionary in the mid-1960s when he had the idea of building an open-air shopping center near Miami Beach for luxury retailers, naming it Bal Harbour Shops, died on May 24 at his home in Miami Shores, Fla.","Stanley F. Whitman, a real estate developer who was hailed as a visionary in the mid-1960s when he had the idea of building an open-air shopping center near Miami Beach for luxury retailers, naming it Bal Harbour Shops, died on May 24 at his home in Miami Shores, Fla. He was 98. His family announced his death. A week before he died, officials in the village of Bal Harbour approved a 350,000-square-foot expansion of Bal Harbour Shops, almost doubling its size. He had helped incorporate the village, at the north end of the Miami Beach barrier island. Mr. Whitman was one of the first developers to see the potential of bringing upscale retailers like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue to a shopping center in an outdoor tropical setting. He opened Bal Harbour Shops after visiting retail stores around the world on a kind of fact-finding mission. Landscaped with palm and orange trees, the shopping center is today a stage for more than 100 high-end fashion brands, including Chlo, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton. With 450,000 square feet of retail space now, it is also one of the biggest revenue creators among American malls, generating $2,555 a square foot in sales a year, according to Mr. Whitman's company, Whitman Family Development. ''He touched so many people's lives and changed the shopping center industry,'' said Cheryl Stephenson, a friend who worked for Mr. Whitman. In the succeeding years, many luxury retail centers have been built, among them the Beverly Center in Los Angeles and The Shops at Crystals in Las Vegas. Stanley Finch Whitman was born on Nov. 15, 1918, in Evanston, Ill., to William and Leona E. Whitman. His father owned a printing company in Chicago and also developed real estate properties in the Miami area. The tropical beach setting of Bal Harbour Shops harked back to Mr. Whitman's upbringing. He grew up in Miami Beach with his brothers, Bill and Dudley, in a single-family home on the ocean at 32nd Street and Collins Avenue. Mr. Whitman attended Duke University, where he met his future wife, Dottie Stivers. After graduating during World War II, he joined the Navy's officer training school and went to oversee a fleet of submarine chasers. He was honorably discharged as a lieutenant commander in 1945. By the time he returned from the war, his father had died. Mr. Whitman assumed responsibility for one of the family's Miami Beach properties on Lincoln Road, which was one of the hottest shopping districts during the 1920s but was beginning to decline. His grandson, Matthew W. Lazenby, who now leads the company, said Mr. Whitman had worked diligently to keep the Lincoln Road building immaculate. But he grew frustrated with other real estate owners who put little effort into maintaining their properties, contributing to Lincoln Road's even greater loss of allure in the 1950s and '60s, Mr. Lazenby said. It was the long-lost glamour of Lincoln Road that inspired Mr. Whitman's vision for Bal Harbour Shops, Mr. Lazenby said. Mr. Whitman was one of the 25 people who incorporated what would become the village of Bal Harbour in 1946. He teamed up with Robert Graham, a developer there, to build a business district and later bought out Mr. Graham in pursuing his vision for Bal Harbour Shops. Besides Mr. Lazenby, Mr. Whitman is survived by a son, Randall, who has also been involved in the business; a daughter, Gwen W. Lazenby; three other grandchildren; and four great-grandsons. His wife died in 2008. Mr. Whitman's family described him as an avid weight lifter and tennis player. After his wife, a bicycling enthusiast, suffered a stroke about a year before her death, Mr. Lazenby said, Mr. Whitman spent weeks researching special bicycles for the handicapped until finding one, a two-seater, that allowed her to sit in the rear while he pedaled from the front."

She was 82 and lived in Falls Church, Va. Ms. Ward's supple voice, her easygoing sense of swing and her alluring stage presence were essential to the Goodman band's early success. She toured and recorded with the band from 1934 to 1936, and reunited occasionally with Goodman after World War II. Ms. Ward was born in 1916 in New York City. When she finished high school she started performing in bands led by Nye Mayhew, Eddie Duchin, Dave Rubinoff, Nat Brandwynne and Will Osborne; she also appeared on radio programs on WOR and WNBC, where she became a staff musician. She was singing with Enrique Madriguera's Latin Band in 1934 when the Goodman band was auditioning for an engagement at the Billy Rose Music Hall; she sang with the band at its second audition, and it got the job, although she did not join the Goodman band until a few months later. She also sang with the Goodman band on the radio program ""Let's Dance"" from December 1934 to May 1935; a series of recordings from that program is about to be released by the Circle label. With the Goodman band, she recorded songs including ""Goody Goody,"" ""You Turned the Tables on Me,"" ""It's Been So Long"" and the million-seller ""These Foolish Things."" She recorded ""All My Life"" and ""Too Good to Be True"" with the Goodman trio. Often, she would be handed the sheet music for a song the same day she performed it. After leaving the Goodman band, Ms. Ward turned to recording, appearing on albums with Teddy Wilson, Gene Krupa, Bob Crosby, Joe Sullivan and Harry James. She toured with the band led by Hal McIntyre in 1942 and 1943, and recorded with Red Norvo, Harry James, Wild Bill Davison and Peanuts Hucko. In 1944 she joined Harry James's band. In 1946-47 she produced musical variety shows on WMGM in New York City. She retired from regular performing in the late 1940's but rejoined Goodman for tours and recordings in 1953, 1957 and 1958. In 1979, she came out of retirement, performing at clubs including the Waldorf-Astoria's Starlight Roof and the Rainbow Room in New York City, and she made ""The Helen Ward Song Book"" (Lyricon) in 1981. Lyricon also plans to release an album of her performing in ""Finian's Rainbow,"" from a production recorded in Westchester, N.Y. She is survived by her husband, Bill Savory."

36754,"Emile Peynaud, 92, a Revolutionary Wine Expert Who Defined 'Expert'","Emile Peynaud, a Bordeaux enologist who virtually invented the role of wine consultant, transforming the way wine is made and enjoyed, died on Sunday in his home outside of Bordeaux.","Emile Peynaud, a Bordeaux enologist who virtually invented the role of wine consultant, transforming the way wine is made and enjoyed, died on Sunday in his home outside of Bordeaux. He was 92. The cause was Parkinson's disease, said his daughter, Daniele Peynaud. More than any other individual, Dr. Peynaud helped to bring winemakers into the modern world. As a researcher and consultant, he applied rigorous scientific methods to a field bound more often by haphazard custom, guesswork and superstition. Much of the conventional wisdom in winemaking today can be traced directly to his recommendations, and the scores of globe-trotting consultants who today advise wineries on everything from grapes to barrels to labels owe their livelihoods to him ''There was really one world for winemakers before Emile Peynaud, and another world after,'' said Paul Pontallier, managing director of Chateau Margaux, in Bordeaux. At a time when growers typically harvested grapes early to prevent rot, Dr. Peynaud advocated delaying the harvest until the grapes were fully ripe. He urged winemakers to select only the best grapes for their wines, a difficult notion for many to accept at a time when quantity was often more important than quality. He advocated controlling temperatures during fermentation and insisted on improving hygiene in the cellar. He suggested that wineries develop less expensive labels for grapes that did not meet the standard of their top label. ''Professor Peynaud was the architect who sparked the revolution in Bordeaux wine quality that has flourished over the last several decades,'' said Robert M. Parker Jr., the American wine critic. Bordeaux producers and connoisseurs once believed that wines needed to be tough and unpleasant in their youth to have the potential to age and become great. Dr. Peynaud rejected the notion that a wine could only be enjoyed after years in the cellar. As a result, Bordeaux and most Bordeaux-style wines today are far more pleasing in their early years. ''He told us that a great old wine has to be a great young one,'' Mr. Pontallier said. ''He said the balance had to be there from the very beginning, from the grapes themselves.'' Dr. Peynaud's work extended well beyond Bordeaux-style wines. He learned how to control malolactic fermentation, a secondary fermentation that takes place after the grape juice has already become wine, a crucial step in bottling stable wines. ''Until he did this, in around 1955, people had always guessed when it was finished, and then you had it taking place in the bottle, and you had fizzy wines,'' said Philip Togni, the California winemaker, who studied with Dr. Peynaud in the 1950's at the University of Bordeaux. As influential as he was as a scientist, Dr. Peynaud made perhaps his biggest mark as an adviser and consultant, working with wineries in Italy, Spain, Chile, Peru and California, as well as in Bordeaux. There his scores of clients included renowned chateaus like Lynch-Bages and Leoville-Las Cases, as well as Margaux. Dr. Peynaud was born in Bordeaux in 1912 and entered the wine business as a cellar worker before he became an enologist. World War II interrupted his career. He was captured by the Germans early in the war and spent most of the war in a prison camp, Mr. Togni said. He later became a professor of enology at the University of Bordeaux, and began advising wine makers in the late 1940's. He wrote two influential books, ''Knowing and Making Wine'' and ''The Taste of Wine.'' In addition to his daughter, Dr. Peynaud is survived by his wife, Yvonne, and a son, Jean-Pierre. By all accounts, Dr. Peynaud was a modest man, not given to grand pronouncements or predictions. In the 1970's, his list of Bordeaux clients was said to be in the hundreds, and the story was told that if he merely slowed down his white Citro<3>n down in front of a particular chateau, it was understood that he was consulting, and that chateau's standing would go up. As much as he applied science to wine, Dr. Peynaud understood that some things were beyond analysis. Assessing a bottle of 1975 Chateau d'Yquem, the great Sauternes, back in 1983, Dr. Peynaud noted that all the factors that made the wine so special -- the concentration of the grape, the method of harvest, the degree of Botrytis cinerea, or ''noble rot'' -- were subject to the judgment and discretion of the winemaker. ''You don't work with measurable things,'' he said."
17636,"Major Owens, 77, Education Advocate in Congress, Dies","Major R. Owens, a former librarian who went to Congress from Brooklyn and remained there for 24 years, fighting for more federal aid for education and other liberal causes, died on Monday in Manhattan.","Major R. Owens, a former librarian who went to Congress from Brooklyn and remained there for 24 years, fighting for more federal aid for education and other liberal causes, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 77. His death, at NYU Langone Medical Center, was caused by renal and heart failure, his son Chris said. Mr. Owens lived in Brooklyn. Mr. Owens, as a state senator and a former chief administrator of New York City's antipoverty program, was a prominent figure in Brooklyn when he won the House seat vacated by the retiring Shirley Chisholm in 1982. Fourteen years earlier, she became the first black woman elected to Congress. Mr. Owens represented an overwhelmingly Democratic swath of the borough that included Crown Heights and parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Flatbush and Park Slope. The district encompassed stretches of severe blight and poverty, along with areas of middle-class stability and pockets of affluence. He viewed education as ''the kingpin issue,'' as he put it in an article he wrote for the publication Black Issues in Higher Education. ''We have to believe that all power and progress really begins with education,'' he wrote. As a member of the House committee that dealt with education, Mr. Owens spent much time sponsoring and shaping measures to put more federal money into reducing high school dropout rates, hiring more teachers and improving library services. Many of his provisions became parts of wider education bills. In 1985, he wrote parts of a successful bill that authorized a $100 million fund to strengthen historically black colleges. In a hearing on the legislation, he said the fund was needed because ''most of the historically black colleges are struggling.'' He recalled his own days at one of those institutions, Morehouse College in Atlanta, from which he graduated in 1956. ''Most of the youngsters there were poor, from very poor backgrounds,'' he said, and Morehouse ''played a vital role of nurturing.'' Mr. Owens, who was considered one of the most liberal members of the House, opposed an agreement between President Bill Clinton and Congressional Republicans to give states more flexibility in how they spent billions in federal school aid. ''We cannot leave it up to the states,'' he said. ''They have not done a good job.'' On other fronts, Mr. Owens was a floor manager of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, aimed at curbing discrimination against handicapped people. He defended organized labor and supported proposals to prohibit the deportation of illegal immigrants who fell into various categories. Mr. Owens, whose first wife, the former Ethel Werfel, was white and Jewish, frequently urged blacks and Jews to bridge their differences. He condemned the Nation of Islam as a ''hate-mongering fringe group'' after anti-Semitic remarks by its leader, Louis Farrakhan. Even before tensions between blacks and Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights erupted into riots in summer 1991, he denounced the ''Rambo types on both sides'' who, he said, only poured oil on the strife. Mr. Owens was a low-key politician, but he had a colorful streak; he wrote and even performed rap lyrics, for example. He titled one number, about male sexuality, ''The Viagra Monologues,'' a takeoff on the name of Eve Ensler's play ''The Vagina Monologues.'' Other lyrics, which he performed in open-mike sessions at cafes and entered into the Congressional Record, dealt with goings-on in Washington. One rap number commented on a 1990 budget accord between Congress and the White House. Here is how it began: At the big white D.C. mansion There's a meeting of the mob And the question on the table Is which beggars will they rob. Major Robert Odell Owens was born in Collierville, Tenn., on June 28, 1936, to Ezekiel and Edna Owens. His father worked in a furniture factory. In 1956, the year he graduated from Morehouse, Mr. Owens married Ms. Werfel. The marriage ended in divorce. He later married the former Maria Cuprill. After earning a master's degree in library science in 1957 from Atlanta University (which later became Clark Atlanta), Mr. Owens moved to New York City and worked as a librarian in Brooklyn from 1958 to the mid-1960s. He was executive director of the Brownsville Community Council, an antipoverty group, until Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed him to oversee the city's antipoverty program in 1968 as commissioner of the Community Development Agency, a post he held until 1973. Mr. Owens was a state senator from Brooklyn from 1975 until 1982, when he won the Democratic primary for Ms. Chisholm's House seat. In a district so heavily Democratic, the primary victory was tantamount to election. His opponent in the primary, Vander L. Beatty, also a state senator from Brooklyn, was later convicted of forgery and conspiracy in seeking to get the result overturned. In his 11 campaigns for re-election Mr. Owens faced significant opposition only twice, in 2000 and 2004, when his primary opponents contended, to no avail, that he was no longer attentive to the needs of his constituents, especially the many of Caribbean origin. He retired from Congress in 2006. His son Chris lost in a four-way primary race to succeed him. Afterward Mr. Owens taught public administration at Medgar Evers College, a Brooklyn branch of the City University of New York. His book ''The Peacock Elite: A Case Study of the Congressional Black Caucus'' was published in 2011. Besides his son Chris, from his first marriage, Mr. Owens is survived by his wife; two other sons from his first marriage, Millard and Geoffrey, an actor who appeared on television as the son-in-law Elvin on ''The Cosby Show''; three brothers, Ezekiel Jr., Mack and Bobby; a sister, Edna Owens; a stepson, Carlos Cuprill; a stepdaughter, Cecilia Cuprill-Nunez; four grandchildren and four step-grandchildren."

He was 87. Mr. Zamboni put together his first ice resurfacer in 1947 using a war-surplus Jeep engine, the front ends of two automobiles, a series of pulleys and a wooden bin to catch ice shavings. The machine was patented in 1949. Hockey fans often greet the machines with chants of ''Zamboni, Zamboni,'' when the vehicles are driven onto the ice between periods of games. The Frank J.

Mr. Dohanos was born on May 18, 1907, in Lorain, Ohio, and attended the Cleveland School of Art. His first work as a magazine illustrator was published in McCall's in 1938.

He was either 66 or 67; he was born in 1939 but he did not know his birth date. His record company, World Circuit Records, said he had suffered from bone cancer. Mr. Toure's deep grounding in Malian traditions made him one of African music's most profound innovators. ''Mali is first and foremost a library of the history of African music,'' he said in a 2005 interview with the world-music magazine Fly. ''It is also the sharing of history, legend, biography of Africa.'' In Mali he was considered a national hero. At the news of his death, government radio stations there suspended regular programming to play his music. Mr. Toure collaborated widely, winning Grammys for albums he made with the American guitarist Ry Cooder (''Talking Timbuktu'' in 1994) and with the Malian griot Toumani Diabate (''In the Heart of the Moon,'' 2005). He also recorded with the American bluesman Taj Mahal. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Cooder said: ''It's important for a traditional performer to be coming from a place and tradition, and most people who are like that tend to be part of their scene rather than transcendent of their scene. That's what their calling is all about. But Ali was a seeker. There was powerful psychology there. He was not governed by anything. He was free to move about in his mind.'' Mr. Toure forged connections between the hypnotic modal riffs of Malian songs and the driving one-chord boogie of American bluesmen like John Lee Hooker; he mingled the plucked patterns of traditional songs with the aggressive lead-guitar lines of rock. He sang in various West African languages -- his own Sonrai as well as Songhai, Bambara, Peul, Tamasheck and others -- reflecting the traditional foundations of the songs he wrote. His lyrics, in West African style, represented the conscience of a community, urging listeners to work hard, honor the past and act virtuously. Mr. Toure was his family's 10th child, and the first to survive infancy. ''Farka,'' a nickname, means ''donkey,'' an animal praised for its tenacity. No information was available on his immediate survivors. Unlike many West African musicians, Mr. Toure was not born into a musical dynasty; rather, he was drawn to music despite the wishes of his family. Hearing the music of spirit ceremonies, he taught himself to play the njurkle, a one-stringed West African lute, in 1950, then the n'jarka, a one-stringed fiddle, and later the n'goni, a four-stringed lute. When he was about 13, after an encounter with a snake, he suffered attacks he believed to have been caused by contact with the spirit world. Sent away for a year to be cured, he returned as someone who was recognized for the ability to communicate with spirits. ''I have all the spirits,'' he wrote in liner notes to the collection ''Radio Mali'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch). ''I work the spirits and I work with the spirits.'' After seeing the Guinean guitarist Keita Fodeba, he took up the guitar in the mid-1950's and joined a local band. Mali became independent of France in 1960, and in 1962 Mr. Toure became the leader of the Niafunke village cultural troupe, dedicated to preserving local culture. At the same time, he was listening to American soul, blues and funk, which he heard as rooted in the music of West Africa. In 1970 Mr. Toure moved to Bamako, the nation's capital, where he became an engineer at Radio Mali and a frequent performer on the air. Six albums of music recorded at Radio Mali were released in France in the 1970's. In 1980, he returned to his hometown, Niafunke, and established a farm that he tended between musical engagements. He toured Africa widely, establishing a reputation across West Africa. In 1987 he performed in Britain and began recording for international release with ''Ali Farka Toure'' (World Circuit/Nonesuch). The stark propulsion of his music, and its hints of electric blues, made him a star on the world-music circuit, and he toured the United States, Europe and Japan. Around 2000 he retired from touring to return to his farm. He often said that he considered himself a farmer above all, and in 2004 he was elected mayor of the 53 villages of the Niafunke region. He established the Ali Farka Toure Foundation, nurturing younger Malian musicians, and he continued to perform in Mali. But he still made occasional international forays; his final concert was last year at a festival in Nice, France."

He was 87. In 1967, when the Whitney Museum of American Art organized a retrospective of Mr. Marca-Relli's work, the show's curator, William Agee, said, ""Marca-Relli's achievement has been to raise collage to a scale and complexity equal to that of monumental painting."" John Canaday, reviewing the show in The New York Times, described the artist's ""success in bringing restlessly energetic forms into static position without deadening them, his strong echoes of classical architecture as filtered through the Italian Renaissance, and his increasing interest in high polish."" Born in Boston in 1913, Mr. Marca-Relli was the son of a journalist whose assignments abroad allowed the family to spend years in Europe. Mr. Marca-Relli had his first art lessons as a boy in Italy. In the United States, he attended Cooper Union briefly and then, at 18, struck out on his own. He taught art, worked as an illustrator for newspapers and magazines and joined the Federal Art Project of the W.P.A., through which he met Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and John Graham. His acquaintance with them helped familiarize him with modernism. After serving in the Army, he had his first solo show in New York in 1947: surreal dreamscapes with circus themes and allusions to Italian Renaissance buildings, influenced by the work of Giorgio de Chirico. He then switched to thickly painted, agitated abstractions, affected by an exhibition he had seen of the painter Arshile Gorky. But he was dissatisfied. He had a breakthrough in Mexico during the summer of 1953, when, having run out of paint, he started making collages from what was at hand. Returning to the United States and inspired by de Kooning's ""Women,"" Mr. Marca-Relli began a series of abstract collages based on human figures. These jigsaw collages consisted of raw canvas or linen stuck like shingles to a larger canvas and then painted. He described his goal as bringing accident and gesture, qualities of Abstract Expressionism, to the usually methodical medium of collage. He cut shapes quickly, intuitively. The idea was not ""speed for its own sake, but to create through free, automatic action, before conscious thought can censor out creativity,"" he said. During the 1960's he applied the technique to metal and vinyl, creating works alluding to wings, fuselages and airplanes, and this activity led him to make sculptures before returning to canvas and paint. Painting, he said, is ""a continuous attempt at solving insoluble problems."" ""You just keep working and you never get it clear to yourself,"" he added. Mr. Marca-Relli made intense small-scale abstractions and bigger figurative collages in the 70's, Belle Epoque spoofs in the 80's. His palette, typically somber, broadened, and for a while he even experimented with spray paint, but without undoing his essential European-inflected elegance, which was a virtue to supporters, a weakness to detractors, who complained occasionally about what one critic called ""secondhand sumptuousness."" He was elegant in person, known among friends as a restless, charming hypochondriac. Writers stressed his fondness for fast cars. In 1951 he married Anita Gibson, a Peruvian and the daughter of Percy Gibson, the poet. Over the years they lived in East Hampton, N.Y., where he became a close friend and neighbor of Jackson Pollock; and also in Wayne, N.J.; Ibiza, Spain; Sarasota, Fla.; Rome; Paris; and London. The couple moved to Parma four years ago. Mr. Marca-Relli's work was frequently shown and collected. Among recent exhibitions were a survey last year at the Peggy Guggenheim Museum in Venice and another this year in Darmstadt, Germany. Last year he was made an honorary citizen of Italy. He is survived by his wife. http://www.nytimes.com"
638,"Lucille Roberts, 59, Founder Of Fitness Chain for Women","Lucille Roberts, a businesswoman whose ambition to create ""the McDonald's of health clubs"" inspired a chain of bargain-basement gyms for women, died yesterday at New York University Downtown Hospital in Manhattan.","Lucille Roberts, a businesswoman whose ambition to create ""the McDonald's of health clubs"" inspired a chain of bargain-basement gyms for women, died yesterday at New York University Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 59. The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Bob. She lived in Manhattan. Mrs. Roberts built a chain of 50 gyms with 200,000 members in the New York metropolitan region by charging half or less of what many competitors asked. Her clubs were forwomen only, partly because she wanted to protect women from being ogled in coed gyms. Mrs. Roberts said her target market was secretaries, teachers and the wives of policemen, and she said she knew how to please them -- an assertion the $50 million collected each year from members seemed to support. ""It is only the upper classes who are into exercise for health,"" she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1997. ""The middle classes just want to look good. We have tried health classes. They just want to fit into tight jeans."" Her business strategy involved recruiting as many members as possible and crowding them into large gyms. By continually adding more gyms, she was able to keep down the cost of advertising -- a significant and critical expenditure for health clubs -- on a per-member basis. The result was summed up by a promotional slogan Lucille Roberts used for years: ""More Gym Less Money."" Ms. Roberts was born in the Soviet Union on Dec. 7, 1943, in what is now an independent country, Tajikistan. In an interview in Success magazine in 1998, she said her father lost a son in the war. ""I became a surrogate son,"" she said. ""I never knew there was anything in the world I couldn't do. It was just a matter of when and how."" Her family was Jewish, and, facing religious persecution in the Soviet Union, immigrated to the United States and settled in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn when she was 13. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1964 and worked in a succession of jobs in retailing. The last was at Kitty Kelly Inc., which sold shoes and other merchandise. Mrs. Roberts was promised a $50 raise if she met a difficult sales target. She reached it, but did not receive the raise. She quit and started her own business with her husband. In addition to him, she is survived by her sons Kevin and Kirk, both of Manhattan. Mrs. Roberts hated to deal with inventory and wanted to find a business in which things like colors and sizes did not matter, she said in an interview with CNNfn in 1999. A self-described exercise nut, she said her first idea was to teach an exercise class for women at a hotel. Instead, she decided that what women really needed was a place where they could exercise with no men around, The Wall Street Journal reported in 1997. She and her husband put up $10,000 of their savings, borrowed $5,000 each from their parents and opened a little ""spa"" opposite Macy's in Manhattan. The club was an immediate success, but its name, the Body Shop, caused confusion: People thought it was an auto-repair business. Within two years, two additional clubs opened, and the name was changed to Lucille Roberts. The overriding goal was to be friendly to women. No heavy weights or elaborate machines were emphasized; classes were easy to follow and taught by people with less-than-perfect bodies. The classes lasted only 30 minutes so they could easily fit into women's schedules. The Robertses also invested heavily in real estate, buying whole shopping centers as well as individual buildings for health clubs. At the time of her death, they were about to begin selling franchises elsewhere in the United States, Mr. Roberts said."

He was 83. The cause was congestive heart failure, the Twins said. Carneal was part of the Twins' radio play-by-play team for all but the first year of the team's existence in Minnesota. He called Athletics and Phillies games in Philadelphia and Orioles games in Baltimore before coming to Minnesota in 1962, a year after the Washington Senators became the Twins. Carneal received the Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award for major contributions to baseball broadcasting in 1996.

He was 89. The museum confirmed his death. Mr. Strochlitz found success as a Ford dealer, but he could not and did not wish to forget his awful experience in Nazi camps. In an interview with The Hartford Courant in 2003, he said he regretted removing the number tattooed on his arm in Auschwitz. So in 1978 he readily accepted when Mr. Wiesel asked President Carter to name him to the President's Commission on the Holocaust. In 2003, Together, a quarterly newspaper published by the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, called him Mr. Wiesel's ''chief lieutenant, his eyes and ears.'' President Carter dispatched the two men and a band of colleagues to Eastern Europe, Denmark and Israel to study Holocaust memorials and cemeteries. Eventually, the full commission articulated the vision that would materialize as today's museum near the National Mall. Mr. Strochlitz's most visible role was as chairman of the remembrance committee. Less conspicuously, Mr. Strochlitz organized a campaign for Mr. Wiesel to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which he did receive, in 1986. Together reported that Mr. Strochlitz relentlessly lobbied prominent people, including many heads of state. ''There was nowhere that Strochlitz would not go, no one with whom he would not speak,'' the newspaper said. Sigmund Strochlitz was born in Bedzin, Poland, in 1916, and went to a Hebrew high school before entering Jagiellonian University, where his studies were interrupted by World War II. In 1939, he escaped to the Soviet zone of occupied Poland, but missed his family and returned to Bedzin. In August 1943, as Poland's last ghettoes were being emptied, he and his family were deported to Birkenau, one of three camps at Auschwitz and the one where human extermination was done. His parents, sister and wife were killed on arrival. He survived 15 months there. Mr. Wiesel was there at the same time. As the war neared its end, he also survived perilous marches through a series of other camps. He ended up at the Bergen-Belsen camp in Germany, which was liberated by the British in April 1945. After the war, he stayed in Bergen-Belsen, which the British had made into a camp for displaced persons. He married Rose Grinberg there. She died in 2001. Mr. Strochlitz is survived by two sons, Jaime Strochlitz-Wurzel of Newton, Mass., and Rafael Strochlitz-Wurzel of New Britain, Conn.; two daughters, Halina Kirshenbaum of Tel Aviv, and Romana Strochlitz Primus of Waterford, Conn.; 14 grandchildren; and 23 great-grandchildren. Mr. Strochlitz and his wife emigrated to New York in 1951. In 1956, he turned down a chance to run a Ford dealership in Manhattan for one in New London, which reminded him of his small town in Poland. His slogan: ''Come in. I would like to meet you.'' His work for Jewish causes included the presidency of the friends of Haifa University and a term as a governor of Bar-Ilan University, both in Israel; service as a trustee of the American Jewish Congress; and membership in the American Society for Yad Vashem, which documents the Holocaust. Mr. Strochlitz spoke out forcefully on many issues, including the importance of remembering Gypsies killed by Hitler. He recalled the night 4,000 were murdered. ''In the morning, there was no more music, no more song,'' he said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1986. ''Just stinking smoke in the air.'' In 1979, in a speech in the Connecticut Legislature, he sharply criticized Polish gentiles for helping the Nazis, sparking a firestorm of criticism. He said later that he had no regrets about his remarks, since although he was sure some gentiles had helped Jews, he himself had personally never witnessed it. One of Mr. Strochlitz's major contributions to the Holocaust museum came when he visited it shortly before its opening in 1993, Together reported. He looked at the model of the Birkenau crematoria, the very ones in which his family had burned. He sensed something important was missing. ''Where are the killers?'' he asked. A sculpture of a Nazi putting gas canisters in the chamber was added."

He was 69. He died of a single gunshot wound, presumably self-inflicted, the police said on Wednesday. The Garrard County Coroner, Clyde Merida, would not give further details, saying that the death was under investigation. Mr. Kane was an up-and-coming freelance art director when he was brought in to photograph whatever musicians were available -- 57 turned up -- for Esquire magazine's celebration of what it considered to be the golden age of jazz. The musicians posed in front of a brownstone on East 126th Street in Harlem in the summer of 1958, and Mr. Kane's picture ran across two pages in Esquire the next January. It was essentially a class portrait of America's greatest jazz musicians, among them Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Charles Mingus, Gene Krupa, Maxine Sullivan and Sonny Rollins. The photograph became the inspiration for a documentary by Jean Bach titled ""A Great Day in Harlem.""

5660,"Leslie Lee, 83, Playwright of Black Life","Leslie Lee, a playwright whose award-winning work, much of it with the Negro Ensemble Company, focused on stretching the boundaries of the African-American experience as it was portrayed on the stage, died on Monday in Manhattan.","Leslie Lee, a playwright whose award-winning work, much of it with the Negro Ensemble Company, focused on stretching the boundaries of the African-American experience as it was portrayed on the stage, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 83. The cause was congestive heart failure, Heather Massie, a friend, said. Over four decades, Mr. Lee wrote more than two dozen stage works, scouring American history for his subjects and characters. In ''Black Eagles,'' he wrote about black fighter pilots in Italy in World War II. In ''Ground People'' (originally titled ''The Rabbit Foot''), he wrote about Southern black sharecroppers and visiting minstrel-show performers in the 1920s. In ''Blues in a Broken Tongue,'' the daughter of a family that had moved to Russia in the 1930s as an escape from racism discovers a pile of recordings by Billie Holiday, Paul Robeson and others and reconsiders her heritage. An early play, ''The War Party,'' was about the conflicts within a community civil rights organization in the 1960s. In ''The Book of Lambert,'' written in the 1970s and set contemporaneously on an abandoned New York subway platform, a black intellectual has been reduced to despair by the loss of the white woman he loves. In ''Colored People's Time,'' Mr. Lee presented a century of black history, from the Civil War to the dawn of the civil rights movement, in a pageantlike parade of vignettes. ''One can be black and also many other things,'' Mr. Lee said in a 1975 interview about his writerly concerns. ''I want to expand the thinking of blacks about themselves.'' Most of Mr. Lee's work was produced Off Broadway and on regional stages, though his best-known play, ''The First Breeze of Summer'' (1975), appeared on Broadway, at the Palace Theater, after moving from the St. Mark's Playhouse, then the home of the Negro Ensemble Company, in the East Village. It was nominated for a Tony Award for best play. (Tom Stoppard's ''Travesties'' was the winner.) ''The First Breeze of Summer'' tells the story of a middle-class black family in Pennsylvania whose ambitious and sensitive younger son is emotionally derailed when he learns the past secrets of the grandmother he reveres. Mr. Lee acknowledged that it was an autobiographical work. And at a time when black theater was often polemical, it was notable for its naturalistic drama and its probing of family dynamics and character. That it had its debut in an earlier era, both theatrically and journalistically, was evident in Walter Kerr's review in The New York Times. ''For all the explicitly black experience detailed in 'The First Breeze of Summer,' '' Mr. Kerr wrote near the conclusion of an unqualified rave that was redolent of surprise, ''I have rarely seen a play at which someone who is not black can feel so completely at home.'' Leslie Earl Lee was born on Nov. 6, 1930, in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and grew up nearby in West Conshohocken, one of nine children. His mother, the former Clementine Carter, was a homemaker; his father, John Henry Lee, like the patriarch in ''First Breeze,'' was a plastering contractor. Mr. Lee studied English and biology at the University of Pennsylvania -- he thought he would be a doctor -- and worked as a hospital medical technician, as a bacteriologist for the state health department and as a researcher for Wyeth, the pharmaceutical company, before abandoning his scientific pursuits in the mid-1960s to study playwriting at Villanova University. (For a time, his roommate was David Rabe, who went on to his own award-winning playwriting career). Mr. Lee taught writing at several colleges, including New York University, and wrote several television scripts, including an adaptation of Richard Wright's short story ''Almos' a Man.'' ''The First Breeze of Summer'' was broadcast as part of the ''Great Performances'' series on public television. His other stage work includes two collaborations with the composer Charles Strouse and the lyricist Lee Adams, creators of ''Bye Bye Birdie,'' ''Applause'' and other shows. Together they updated another Strouse-Adams show, ''Golden Boy,'' the 1964 musical based on Clifford Odets's boxing drama; the newer version, with Mr. Lee's book, was presented in 1989 at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Florida. The three men also worked on a musical about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that follows Dr. King from his teenage years in Atlanta to the Montgomery bus boycott of the 1950s. The show had its premiere Off Broadway at the Kraine Theater in 2011. Mr. Lee won numerous Audelco Awards, given to black theater artists and productions. He was married once and divorced. He is survived by a brother, Elbert, and three sisters, Evelyn Lee Collins, Grace Lee Wall and Alma Lee Coston. In 2008, ''The First Breeze of Summer'' was revived Off Broadway by the Signature Theater Company in a production that starred Leslie Uggams and was directed by Ruben Santiago-Hudson. ''He captured African-American life with all its frailties and all its power,'' Mr. Santiago-Hudson said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ''Most of all he bestowed integrity on people, even when they were ne'er-do-wells or people whose intentions weren't the best for other folks. Leslie wasn't only poetic; he was authentic.''"

20568,"Rick Fields, 57, Poet and Expert on Buddhism","Rick Fields, a journalist, poet and leading authority on Buddhism's history and development in the United States, died on Sunday at his home in Fairfax, Calif.","Rick Fields, a journalist, poet and leading authority on Buddhism's history and development in the United States, died on Sunday at his home in Fairfax, Calif. He was 57. The cause was lung cancer, said Helen Tworkov, a longtime friend and the editor in chief of Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, a magazine that Mr. Field helped found in 1991 and that he had worked for as a contributing editor. Mr. Fields wrote several books, the best known of which is ""How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in America"" (Shambhala, 1981). The book traces Buddhism's origins in the United States from Chinese railroad workers and American transcendentalists like Henry David Thoreau in the mid-19th century, to Japanese immigrants on the West Coast at the turn of the century, to the writer Alan Watts and Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg in the 1950's, to the mass popularity of Zen Buddhism and the introduction of Tibetan Buddhism in the 1960's and 70's. In a revised edition of ""How the Swans Came to the Lake"" that was published by Shambhala in 1991, an additional chapter details the fast growth of and broadening interest in Buddhism in the 80's and early 90's. ""Rick Fields was one of our foremost interpreters of Buddhism for Americans,"" said Robert A. F. Thurman, professor of Indo-Tibetan Studies at Columbia University and the nation's pre-eminent scholar on Tibetan Buddhism. Mr. Fields started his journalism career at the Whole Earth Catalog in 1969. In recent years, he was editor of Yoga Journal and a contributing editor of New Age Journal. He had previously founded the Loka Journal and was editor in chief of the Vajradhatu Sun, which later became the Shambhala Sun. He was also a teacher for several years at the Naropa Institute's Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics in Boulder, Colo. His other books include ""Code of the Warrior"" (HarperCollins, 1991), ""The Awakened Warrior"" (Tarcher, 1994), ""Chop Wood, Carry Water"" (Tarcher, 1984), ""The Turquoise Bee-Love: Poems of the Sixth Dalai Lama"" with Brian Cutillo (HarperCollins, 1994) and ""Instructions to the Cook; A Zen Master's Lessons in Living a Life That Matters,"" with Bernard Glassman (Bell Tower, 1996). Born Frederick Douglas Fields in Queens, he was a track star at Andrew Jackson High School and attended Harvard University. He was expelled from the university in 1964, his wife, Marcia, said, after an illicit off-campus liaison with a Radcliffe College student. ""The dean told him he was a danger to Western civilization,"" Mrs. Fields said. After college, Mr. Fields, who was raised as an atheist, drifted to New York and became friendly with Ginsberg and the poet Gary Snyder. Shortly afterward, he moved to California and became part of the Zen centers in San Francisco and later in Los Angeles. In the early 70's, he developed an interest in Tibetan Buddhism. Since 1973, he had been a student of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and other teachers in the Kagyu and Nyingma traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his parents, Al and Reva Fields, of Keene, N.H., and his sisters, Laura Jawitz of Madison, N.H., and Joanna Bogin of New Hartford, Conn. Mr. Fields's most recent book, published in 1997 by Crooked Cloud Projects, consists of poetry dealing with his cancer. He spent much of his final five years grappling with the subject from a Buddhist perspective. ""I don't have a life-threatening disease,"" he said in an interview with Ms. Tworkov in Tricycle in 1997. ""My life is threatening my disease, in that it is keeping the disease from taking over. I have a disease-threatening life."" http://www.nytimes.com"
58744,"Nellie King, 82, Pirates Announcer","Nellie King, a former Pirates pitcher who became a popular announcer for the club, died Wednesday.","PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Nellie King, a former Pirates pitcher who became a popular announcer for the club, died Wednesday. He was 82. The cause was colon cancer and pneumonia, according to Duquesne University, where he worked from 1975 to 1992 as the sports information director. A 6-foot-6 right-hander, he grew up in Hershey, Pa., and had modest success as a pitcher for the Pirates. He went 7-5 while appearing in 95 games from 1954 to 1957, all but four as a reliever. After his playing career ended, Mr. King became a broadcaster in suburban Pittsburgh. In 1967, he was hired to work alongside Bob Prince and Jim Woods as an announcer. After Mr. Woods left to replace Harry Caray in St. Louis in 1970, Mr. King and Mr. Prince worked as partners until Mr. Prince's ouster in 1975 led the Pirates to also fire Mr. King. The duo was a contrast in styles -- Mr. Prince was loud and colorful, Mr. King was soft-spoken and an expert interviewer -- but they worked well together on broadcasts that beamed to much of the East Coast on the 50,000-watt radio station KDKA. Their firings angered numerous Pirates fans, and about 15,000 turned out for a downtown parade urging the team to rehire Mr. Prince and Mr. King. The team later acknowledged that the firings had been a major mistake that alienated longtime fans. Mr. Prince came back briefly in 1985 and died later that year, but Mr. King never returned to the Pirates' broadcast booth on a full-time basis."

Ramage, a retired vice admiral who served in the Pacific in World War II and was one of the Navy's most decorated submariners, died of cancer on Monday at his home in Bethesda, Md.","Lawson P. Ramage, a retired vice admiral who served in the Pacific in World War II and was one of the Navy's most decorated submariners, died of cancer on Monday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 81 years old. Admiral Ramage, a 1931 graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, retired in 1969 as the commander of the Navy's Military Sea Transportation Service, then the oceangoing transport branch of the armed forces. But most of his Navy service was with submarines. He won the Medal of Honor after a submarine he commanded, the U.S.S. Parche, attacked a heavily escorted Japanese convoy in the South China Sea off Taiwan on July 31, 1944, sinking two enemy vessels and damaging several others. The Parche's crew received a Presidential Unit Citation, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt personally presented Admiral Ramage, then a commander, and six other Army and Navy heroes with the Medal of Honor on Jan. 10, 1945. Navy Cross and Silver Star In June 1942, as commander of the submarine Trout, he won the Navy Cross for valor in action at Midway, Truk, the Solomons and in the South China Sea. The Trout's crew was also awarded a Presidential citation. Admiral Ramage, a native of Monroe Bridge, Mass., was stationed at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked on Dec. 7, 1941. He served aboard the U.S.S. Grenadine from April to June 1942, and was awarded the Silver Star Medal ''for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity'' as navigator on patrol in enemy-controlled waters. After being commissioned as an ensign at Annapolis in 1931, he spent the next four years on several ships before taking submarine training and serving as executive officer on the U.S.S. Sands. Led Search for the Thresher After the war Admiral Ramage served in various submarine commands. In April 1963, as deputy commander of submarine forces in the Atlantic Fleet, he led the search operation for the atomic submarine Thresher, which sank in the Atlantic 220 miles east of Boston while making deep-dive tests, with the loss of 129 lives. Admiral Ramage was an expert witness in the ensuing Navy inquiry. He was promoted to vice admiral later that year, became deputy chief of naval operations and became commander of the Military Sea Transportation Service in 1967. Admiral Ramage's survivors include his wife of 55 years, the former Barbara Alice Pine; two sons, James, of Southboro, Mass., and Alfred, of Winthrop, Mass.; two daughters, Joan Mitchell of Washington, and Virginia Ross of Silver Spring, Md.; two brothers, Donald, of Oceanside, Calif., and John, of Rome, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and a great-grandson. A funeral service will be held at Arlington National Cemetery at 2 P.M. Friday."
40952,"Joseph Cotten, 88, Is Dead; Actor on Stage and in Films","Joseph Cotten, a leading man who shifted easily between Broadway and Hollywood, died yesterday at his home in Los Angeles.","Joseph Cotten, a leading man who shifted easily between Broadway and Hollywood, died yesterday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 88. The cause was pneumonia, his business manager and attorney, Hugh Robertson, told The Associated Press. Among his roles in film classics, Mr. Cotten portrayed an idealistic theater critic in Orson Welles's ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), a cryptic merry-widow murderer in Alfred Hitchcock's psychological chiller ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943) and a blundering writer in Carol Reed's romantic thriller ""The Third Man"" (1949). He played the rejected suitor of a youthful aristocrat in ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942), a weapons expert menaced by spies and terrorists in ""Journey Into Fear"" (1942), which he wrote with Mr. Welles, and an artist inspired by a ghost in ""Portrait of Jennie,"" for which he won the best-actor award at the 1949 Venice Film Festival. Mr. Cotten had chiseled features, a resonant voice and a low-key manner. He was tall (6 feet 2 inches) and enhanced his trimness with suits tailor-made without pockets. Broadway and Television His Broadway roles included the estranged husband of a willful socialite (Katharine Hepburn) in the benchmark comedy ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1939-40), the stubborn foil of Margaret Sullavan in the comedy ""Sabrina Fair"" in the early 1950's, an egomaniacal orchestra conductor in a satire, ""Once More With Feeling,"" with Arlene Francis, in the late 1950's, and an embattled industrialist in a thriller, ""Calculated Risk,"" in the 1960's. His co-star in that play was his wife, Patricia Medina. His performances were repeatedly acclaimed by critics and audiences. Reviewing ""Sabrina Fair,"" Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote: ""Mr. Cotten gives a most attractive performance. It is masculine, gravel-voiced, cynical and romantic. He is not limited to one dimension."" Mr. Cotten also had many television credits for both acting and narrating. From 1956 to 1959, he was the host and occasional star of the ""Joseph Cotten Show,"" an anthology series pegged to noted legal cases. Success Came Slowly Joseph Cotten was born on May 15, 1905, in Petersburg, Va., where his father, Joseph Cotten Sr., was an assistant postmaster. The youth attended Petersburg schools and studied acting for a year at the Hickman School of Expression in Washington, where he lost his Virginia drawl. He helped pay for his studies by selling vacuum cleaners and playing center on a professional football team. In his youth, Mr. Cotten sought success in New York but, unable to win an acting assignment, sold paint for two years. Next, he worked in Miami merchandising potato salad and then selling advertisements for The Miami Herald, for which he occasionally wrote drama reviews. He also acted in plays in Miami's Civic Theater for five years. Back in New York, he won a post as an assistant stage manager for the producer David Belasco and had minor roles in several plays. He met and became a friend of Orson Welles, who directed him in several plays for the Federal Theater and Mr. Welles's new Mercury Theater, which Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called ""the liveliest drama household"" on Broadway. A Matinee Idol With his first major role in ""The Philadelphia Story,"" Mr. Cotten became a matinee idol. He then accompanied other members of the Mercury Theater to Hollywood to appear in ""Citizen Kane,"" his first film, when he was 36. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said his performance ""puts to shame the surface posturing of some of our more popular stars."" In World War II, Mr. Cotten entertained Allied troops in the United States and overseas in Welles's variety troupe. His movie roles also included an earnest police detective in ""Gaslight"" (1944), a family friend in ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), a shell-shocked veteran in ""I'll be Seeing You"" (1945), a soulful poet in ""Love Letters"" (1945), a paternalistic rancher in ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946) and an urbane politician in ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (1947). Other characterizations were a weary millionaire in ""September Affair"" (1951), a larcenous bank officer in ""The Steel Trap"" (1952), a brooding veteran badgered by his young wife (Marilyn Monroe) in ""Niagara"" (1953) and a cameo as an alcoholic coroner in Mr. Welles's ""Touch of Evil"" (1958). The Later Films Mr. Cotten appeared in more than 60 movies over 40 years, but after the 1950's his talents were largely wasted. Reviewers characterized nearly all his later films variously as banal, synthetic and pretentious. Nonetheless, the reviewers praised the actor, usually playing supporting roles, as forceful and superior. The later movies included ""Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" (1965), ""The Great Sioux Massacre"" (1965), ""Petulia"" (1968), ""The Grasshopper"" (1970), ""Soylent Green"" (1973), ""A Delicate Balance"" (1973) and ""Airport '77"" (1977). In 1981 he lost his voice after a stroke. Speech therapy allowed him to talk again, but his acting career was over. His last feature film was the legendary flop ""Heaven's Gate."" Mr. Cotten discussed his approach to acting in these terms: ""Directors don't like 'thinking actors,' actors who discuss their work too much. They want you to do it, not talk about it. One director merely told me: 'When you come on, bring something with you.' What is the something? It may be superconfidence, the thing that makes many people dislike actors personally."" Mr. Cotten is survived by his wife. His first wife, Lenore Kipp, a fashion editor, died of leukemia in 1960."

He was 92. Dr. Chan died of natural causes, said his son Lo-Yi. During an academic career of more than 60 years, Dr. Chan also taught at the University of Hawaii, Dartmouth College and Chatham College in Pittsburgh. In 1992, the Association for Asian Studies, honoring Dr. Chan for distinguished contributions to Asian studies, said in its citation, ""Your studies and translations, spanning the entire history of Chinese philosophy, traditional and modern, have opened the way for generations of scholars who, through you, have gained not only a larger understanding of Chinese philosophy but a lively sense of its richness and its implications for the conduct of life in China over the course of centuries."" Work Forged Links Among his writings was the influential ""Source Book in Chinese Philosophy"" (1963) and his collection of essays, ""Chu Hsi: New Studies"" (1989). Dr. Chan was the translator of many books and articles from the Chinese and the author of hundreds of articles in English that helped forge links between scholars from China and the West. A son of peasants, he was born Aug. 18, 1901, in China. With money sent from the United States by their elder sons, his parents sent Mr. Chan for schooling in Hong Kong, where, he once said, he longed to see wonders like ""boats that can fly and ships that can sink and come back again."" In 1924, he graduated from Lingnan University, a Christian college near Canton, now Guangzhou, and left for further schooling in the United States. A chance meeting with a former professor in Harvard Square led him to study philosophy at Harvard, from which he received a doctorate in philosophy in 1928. After a year of travel around the world, he was named academic dean at Lingnan. From 1936 to 1942, he was a professor at the University of Hawaii. From 1942 until he retired in 1966, he was a professor at Dartmouth, teaching Chinese philosophy, religion and esthetics. His reputation flowered after his retirement, when he taught part-time at Chatham College and at Columbia and wrote voluminously. Dr. Chan's wife of 65 years, Wai-Hing, died last year. He is survived by a daughter, Jan Thomas of Berkeley, Calif; two sons, Lo-Yi, of New York, and Gordon, of Mobile, Ala., and five grandchildren."
