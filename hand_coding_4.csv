3211,"Gene Baylos, 98, Is Dead; Comic Kept Peers in Stitches","Gene Baylos, a hard-working nightclub comic of the old school whose gags were legend among fellow comedians, died on Monday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan.","Gene Baylos, a hard-working nightclub comic of the old school whose gags were legend among fellow comedians, died on Monday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 98 and a Manhattan resident. His death was reported by his niece, Perry Matsa. Like countless comedians of his generation, Mr. Baylos began his career in the Catskills in the 1930's and then worked the once-booming national nightclub circuit, starting in the mid-1940's. He opened for Sammy Davis Jr. at the Copacabana in New York and appeared at Ciro's in Los Angeles, the Chez Paree in Chicago and Mother Kelly's in Miami. He went on to enjoy modest success on television, appearing in small roles on situation comedies like ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' and ''Car 54, Where Are You?'' and doing his stand-up act on variety shows like ''The Hollywood Palace.'' He also acted in ''The Family Jewels'' with Jerry Lewis in 1965. But he never got the big break that would have made him as well known as a Milton Berle, a Buddy Hackett or even a Shecky Greene. ''I'm not complaining,'' he told an interviewer for The Daily News in 1981. ''When I was making $10 a night at the Loew's Pitkin in 1942 and living in the Bronx with my mother, I loved it then. When I was making $50 a week, schlepping to Hoboken for three shows a night, I loved it. I'm not bitter. I love my job. I love show business.'' Exactly why he never broke through was hard to say. Phil Greenwald, the talent booker for the Concord Hotel in the Catskills, offered a possible explanation in an interview with The New York Times in 1976. ''Gene is the oldest club-date act in America,'' Mr. Greenwald said. ''He's a very funny guy, a sweet guy. He's played the Concord a million times. His trouble is he doesn't focus his routine enough. He goes off in too many directions.'' Another possible explanation was that Mr. Baylos, while successful as a nightclub act, used material considered too risque for television, where stand-up comedy migrated after the big nightclubs began closing. Jokes like the one about a man who finds his wife in bed with his best friend and says to him, ''Sam, I have to -- but you?'' may seem tame today, but they were considered unfit for a family audience in the 1950's and 60's. Still, Mr. Baylos was always able to find work, even if it was just a booking at a private party. And he could always find an appreciative audience at the New York Friars Club or anywhere else comedians congregated. Alan King once called him ''the comedian in residence, the court jester of the Friars Club,'' adding, ''Put him in a room with 20 comedians and nobody gets laughs except Baylos.'' While Mr. Baylos got big laughs among his peers -- sometimes with shtick as simple as slipping a roll into his pocket while bragging about a lucrative booking -- comedians are, as Mr. Baylos's friend and fellow comic Joey Adams put it, ''a very limited audience.'' Mr. Baylos is survived by his wife of 50 years, Cyrile. He continued working until September 1999, when he fell and broke a hip on the way to the Friars Club, Ms. Matsa said."
29437,"KIM WILLIAMS, COMMENTATOR AND WRITER, DIES IN MONTANA","Kim Williams, a naturalist, writer and guest commentator on National Public Radio's daily news program ''All Things Considered,'' died of cancer yesterday at her home in Missoula, Mont.","Kim Williams, a naturalist, writer and guest commentator on National Public Radio's daily news program ''All Things Considered,'' died of cancer yesterday at her home in Missoula, Mont. She was 62 years old. In her decade on the program, Ms. Williams gained national attention for her folksy commentaries and offbeat advice on ANything from what to eat to when to marry to how to dress. Ms. Williams started giving advice when she was 50 years old, she once told Ian Frazier of The New Yorker, who wrote about her twice in ''Talk of the Town.'' ''There are certain things that you just should do,'' The New Yorker quoted her as saying. ''In the spring, you should eat a dandelion salad. And, starting in July, you have to try and have huckleberry days. Late-afternoon huckleberrying is a grand thing to do.'' Ms. Williams announced on the air three weeks ago that she had terminal cancer and was refusing chemotherapy. In her final radio show, July 16, with Susan Stamberg, co-host of ''All Things Considered,'' she said, ''I wish to die in peace, not in pieces.'' Hundreds Paid Tribute Although Ms. Williams had asked people not to send her mail, Ms. Stamberg said hundreds of letters arrived. Ms. Williams listened from her home to the July 24 program while fans paid tribute, some by audiotape and other in letters read by Ms. Stamberg. A man from Texas wrote, ''I will always think of her and her inimitable voice guiding me along as I walk now through the woods or ponder the culinary merits of some backyard flora.'' Ms. Williams wrote four books. Her latest, published last March, is ''Kim Williams' Book of Uncommon Sense, A Practical Guide With 10 Rules for Nearly Everything.'' Some of the ''uncommon sense'' includes thse thoughts: On losing weight: ''Throw out all women's magazines, they'll drive you schizo. Page 1 is a diet. Page 2 is a chocolate cake. It's a no-win situation.'' On staying married: ''At 9 P.M., say to your spouse, 'Hey did I make you laugh today? Did you make me laugh? Well, now's the time.''' On choosing food: ''If it has more than 10 ingredients, throw it out.'' On dying: ''Don't go ahead of time and don't go ignominiously.'' A Native of New York Ms. Williams was born in Gallatin, N.Y. She attended Cornell University where she received a degree in home economics. She worked various jobs, moved to Missoula, Mont., with her husband in 1971, and began writing a nature column at The Missoulian newspaper. That job led to her own program on the local public radio station, KUFM, which eventually led to ''All Things Considered.'' The University of Montana, where Ms. Williams received her master's degree in interdisciplinary studies, has established the Kim Williams Graduate Fellowship, to be awarded to a student of journalism interested in environmental studies. Ms. Williams is survived by her husband, Melvin Williams; her mother, Veronika Kandiko of Housatonic, Mass.; five sisters, and a brother. A public memorial service will be held at the Music Recital Hall at the University of Montana at 11 A.M. Aug. 14."

Tager, a researcher on diabetes and a medical professor at the University of Chicago, died at his home here on Tuesday.","CHICAGO, Sept. 9 Dr. Howard S. Tager, a researcher on diabetes and a medical professor at the University of Chicago, died at his home here on Tuesday. He was 49. He died of a heart attack, university officials said. Dr. Tager's specialty was the structure and workings of two hormones, insulin and glucagon, which affect the levels of blood sugar in the body. In 1979 he and two others at the university, Dr. Arthur Rubenstein and Dr. Donald Steiner, discovered how a genetic mutation leads to an abnormal form of insulin that causes diabetes. Their research contributed to an improved understanding of diabetes and insulin therapy. ""He made many really important contributions revolving around the insulin molecule and how it regulates blood sugar,"" Dr. Rubenstein, who is the chairman of the University of Chicago's department of medicine, said of Dr. Tager. ""He was also unique in his ability to use physics, chemistry and biochemistry to detect these abnormal insulin structures."" Dr. Tager was born in Los Angeles. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1966 and a Ph.D. in biological chemistry from the University of Michigan in 1971. He taught at the Medical College of Ohio in 1973 before moving to the University of Chicago as an assistant professor of biochemistry the next year.

17422,"Henry Wade, Prosecutor in National Spotlight, Dies at 86","Henry Wade, who in nearly four decades as district attorney of Dallas County, Tex., became the very symbol of law and order there and is perhaps best remembered for the prosecution of Jack Ruby and as the Wade in Roe v. Wade, died yesterday at an assisted-living center in Dallas.","Henry Wade, who in nearly four decades as district attorney of Dallas County, Tex., became the very symbol of law and order there and is perhaps best remembered for the prosecution of Jack Ruby and as the Wade in Roe v. Wade, died yesterday at an assisted-living center in Dallas. He was 86. Mr. Wade's cigar chewing, his drawl, his love of dominoes and his puttering around his farm near Dallas gave him an artfully deceiving image. His folksy manner masked a keen legal mind, a fiercely competitive streak and a relentless faith in the efficacy of punishment. He was district attorney from 1951 to 1987, and during the early years, when his office was relatively small, he often prosecuted cases himself. When he did, he never lost a single one. As a prosecutor in those years, and earlier during three years when he was assistant district attorney, he asked for death sentences on 30 occasions, and got them on 29. As a whole, defense lawyers engaged against his prosecutors achieved one of the lowest acquittal rates in the country. Mr. Wade's office was itself sued in 1970 by a pregnant waitress, Norma McCorvey, identified at the time only as Jane Roe. (The plaintiff in a companion suit had already taken the name Doe.) Ms. McCorvey, a resident of Dallas, sought to keep the district attorney from enforcing a Texas law that prohibited abortion except when a woman's life was at stake. At trial, where one of Mr. Wade's assistants argued his case, the law was declared unconstitutional. The case ultimately made its way to the Supreme Court, which in 1973 issued the landmark decision affirming a woman's right to abortion. Mr. Wade had previously come to national attention in 1964, when he led the prosecution of Jack Ruby. Mr. Ruby had killed Lee Harvey Oswald, President John F. Kennedy's assassin, and it took a jury less than two hours to convict him and sentence him to death. A Texas appeals court overturned the conviction in 1966, citing reasons that included failure to move the trial from Dallas, but Mr. Ruby, by then suffering badly from cancer, died before a new trial could be held. The trial that led to Mr. Ruby's conviction was punctuated by testy exchanges between Mr. Wade and the defendant's lawyer, Melvin Belli. Mr. Belli called Mr. Wade ""a country bumpkin."" Mr. Wade, for his part, insisted on pronouncing Mr. Belli's name BELL-ee rather than BELL-eye, until the judge put a stop to it. What proved to be one of Mr. Wade's less welcome forays into the national spotlight involved the case of Lenell Geter, a young black engineer with no previous criminal record who was serving a life sentence for robbery. Mr. Geter was freed in 1984, having served two years behind bars, after the Dallas prosecutors conceded that he had not committed the crime. Henry Menasco Wade was born on Nov. 11, 1914, in Rockwall, Tex., near Dallas, the son of a judge. He graduated from the University of Texas, received his law degree with highest honors there and was admitted to the Texas bar. After serving as an F.B.I. agent, he was named an assistant district attorney in Dallas in 1947. He ran for district attorney three years later, and was elected. Having held the office for 36 years, he retired in 1987 and became of counsel to a Dallas law firm."
1788,"Carmen Weinstein, 82; Led the Jews of Cairo","Carmen Weinstein, the leader of Cairo's small Jewish community and the driving force behind the restoration of Maimonides's yeshiva and other monuments of Egyptian Jewish history, died on Saturday at her home here on the island of Zamalek.","CAIRO -- Carmen Weinstein, the leader of Cairo's small Jewish community and the driving force behind the restoration of Maimonides's yeshiva and other monuments of Egyptian Jewish history, died on Saturday at her home here on the island of Zamalek. She was 82. Her death was announced by the Jewish Community Council of Cairo, of which she was president. Ms. Weinstein refused to accept that Egypt's once-vibrant Jewish community was dying out, even if its ranks had dwindled to just a few dozen elderly people from more than 80,000 six decades ago. ''We are still in Cairo despite what everybody says,'' she told a Los Angeles Times reporter 11 years ago. When the Historical Society of Jews From Egypt, an American group based in Brooklyn, sought help from Congress to remove historical artifacts and prayer books, known as seforim, to the United States for safekeeping, Ms. Weinstein resisted, saying she would ignore the society's ''insensitive letters referring to our inevitable extinction.'' Instead, in 1997, she persuaded the government to classify the Jewish artifacts as Egyptian antiquities, preventing their sale or export. ''Taking the Jewish seforim, books and records out of Egypt is tantamount to saying that Egypt should demolish the pyramids and the Temple of Luxor because there are no pharaohs left,'' Ms. Weinstein said. She pronounced herself unflustered by any hostility from her Muslim neighbors over tensions between Israel and the Arab world. ''We have no troubles and we don't talk politics,'' she curtly told The Associated Press during Israel's 2009 war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. President Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood, issued a statement mourning the loss of Ms. Weinstein. ''She was a dedicated Egyptian who worked tirelessly to preserve Egyptian Jewish heritage and valued, above all else, living and dying in her country, Egypt,'' he said. Ms. Weinstein was born in Cairo in 1931, during the era of the British-backed monarchy, when Jews were integrated into society as merchants, bankers, artists and professionals. Her father owned a print shop. She attended French and English schools, studied English literature at Cairo University, and earned a master's degree at the American University in Cairo. Like others in the Egyptian elite, she was fluent in French, English and Arabic. Ms. Weinstein was 22 when her father died, in 1953. She took over the print shop with her mother, Esther. They were aided by a younger sister, Glorice, a psychoanalyst in Geneva who survives Carmen. Ms. Weinstein married, but her husband died years ago and she had no children, said Magda S. Haroun, a friend. The death of Ms. Weinstein's father came at a turning point for Egyptian Jews -- a year after a military coup overturned the monarchy and a year before the coup leader, Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser, consolidated power in his own name. Jews had begun leaving Egypt in large numbers during the Arab war with Israel in 1948. Nasser began expelling them. By the end of Egypt's wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973, only a few hundred remained. The Weinstein women were among the holdouts. By the mid-1990s, the remaining Jewish men had mostly died off or moved away. Carmen Weinstein spearheaded a 1996 change to the bylaws of the Jewish Community Council, enabling her mother to become its first female president. After her mother died in 2004, Ms. Weinstein took over. Ms. Weinstein had already distinguished herself as a dogged preservationist. She was best known for her struggle to save the Jewish cemetery at Bassatine from the vandals, squatters and decay that have plagued Egyptian cemeteries of all kinds. It is one of the oldest Jewish cemeteries in the world, and she sometimes used her own money to pay squatters to depart. She will be buried there. Ms. Weinstein also worked to persuade the government to restore some of Cairo's historic synagogues. In 2010, she presided over the restoration of the synagogue and yeshiva once led by Moses Maimonides, a 12th-century Spanish Jew who settled in Cairo, led its Jewish community and became one of the most influential theologians in the history of Judaism. Ms. Haroun said the community of Egyptian Jews in Cairo now numbered fewer than 21, all of them women. A similar community survives in Alexandria, she said, but that group includes one man, who serves as the local council president there. Last month, Ms. Weinstein presided over the annual Passover dinner in a hall of the main synagogue in downtown Cairo. Egyptian Jewish women filled two tables, and they were joined by as many as 50 Jewish expatriates, non-Jewish supporters and foreign diplomats."

Shevchenko, who stunned the world two decades ago when he became the highest-ranking Soviet diplomat to defect to the United States, died on Feb. 28 in obscurity in his suburban home in Bethesda, Md.","WASHINGTON, March 10 Arkady N. Shevchenko, who stunned the world two decades ago when he became the highest-ranking Soviet diplomat to defect to the United States, died on Feb. 28 in obscurity in his suburban home in Bethesda, Md. He was 67. Mr. Shevchenko's death was announced in a brief statement by his church, St. John the Baptist Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Washington. By the time the world began to learn of his death today, he had been buried for three days. Mr. Shevchenko's body was discovered in his home by a daughter, who had gone to check on her father when she could not reach him by telephone, the Montgomery County police said, adding that there was no sign of foul play. The manner of his death could not have been in more stark contrast to the fanfare that greeted his defection to the United States in April 1978. His decision to stay in the United States and spurn his own country caused a major diplomatic dust-up: the Administration of President Carter was at that time engaged in sensitive disarmament talks with the Soviet Union and, as one American official put it at the time, ""This is the last thing we need right now."" Mr. Shevchenko was Under Secretary General of the United Nations at that time, and apparently on course to have a brilliant career in the Government of the Soviet Union. He was a protege of the stone-faced Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, and some diplomatic observers thought he had a shot at one day succeeding his mentor. As events would reveal, he was also a figure of contradictions, a man who wore different faces for different occasions and different people. One West European diplomat at the United Nations called him ""a faceless functionary"" whose habit of poking harmless fun at Soviet officialdom did not detract from the fact that he was a hard-line, doctrinaire Communist with a built-in suspicion of all things Western. Only a handful of people at the Central Intelligence Agency knew that Mr. Shevchenko had been providing information to the American Government for some two and a half years before his defection. One C.I.A. official who did know was F. Mark Wyatt, who held various high posts in the C.I.A. before his retirement. His specialty was shepherding Soviet agents who wanted to help the United States. ""Arkady was a friend of mine,"" Mr. Wyatt said tonight. ""I am grieved."" Mr. Wyatt and other C.I.A. officials agree that, while Mr. Shevchenko did not provide sensational details of secret weapons or war plans, he furnished valuable insights into the thinking of people at the highest level of the Soviet Government, many of whom he knew personally. There really were people in the Kremlin who thought that the United States was controlled by a cabal of Wall Street capitalists in league with oafish Pentagon types with stars on their shoulders, he told his debriefers -- first at a secret C.I.A. ""safe house"" on East 64th Street in Manhattan and, after his defection became public, in more relaxed settings in New York City and Washington. Mr. Wyatt said he came to respect Mr. Shevchenko greatly, convinced that his decision to turn his back on his country was not based on greed but simply on his conviction, as an educated Soviet citizen, that the United States was a better place to live with a better system of government. On the eve of his defection, Mr. Shevchenko told his aides he had to go back to the Soviet Union to visit his gravely ill mother-in-law. Instead, he had told a few Americans of his decision to abandon his country and his career. As Under Secretary General, he was second only to Kurt Waldheim at the United Nations. ""God, we got a big fish!"" Mr. Wyatt recalls one C.I.A. colleague exclaiming at the time. Indeed, Mr. Shevchenko was considered the C.I.A.'s top trophy of the 1970's. An irony in the case was that one C.I.A. agent who debriefed him was Aldrich Ames, who would later betray the United States by selling secrets to the Soviets. His first wife, Leongina, eventually committed suicide after returning to the Soviet Union. He later married an American, but she soon died of cancer, Mr. Wyatt said. Mr. Shevchenko is survived by his third wife, Natasha, a son and daughter and a stepdaughter. In his first life, Arkady Nikolayevich Shevchenko, a native of Ukraine, studied at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, earning a doctorate in 1954, two years before joining the Foreign Ministry. His second life was more erratic. In 1978, a Washington call girl charged publicly that she had been paid by the C.I.A. to provide sex for him. The publicity was shattering to him, Mr. Wyatt recalled tonight. But his book ""Breaking With Moscow"" (Knopf, 1985) brought him fame and prosperity, and earned money on the lecture circuit and as a consultant to research organizations. Mr. Shevchenko complained at first that some of his C.I.A. handlers were insensitive to the trauma of defection. But he made peace with his new country and became an American citizen. ""I was at the ceremony,"" Mr. Wyatt said. ""He was very happy."""
31416,"Alton Meister, 72, a Biochemist Who Advanced AIDS Research","Alton Meister, a biochemist whose research became part of the battle against AIDS and other diseases, died on Thursday at the Mediplex rehabilitation center in Stamford, Conn.","Alton Meister, a biochemist whose research became part of the battle against AIDS and other diseases, died on Thursday at the Mediplex rehabilitation center in Stamford, Conn. He was 72. His wife said the cause was the combined complications of a stroke he suffered last year in New Zealand and infections he picked up during interim treatment at New York Hospital, where her husband had been chief biochemist for many years. Dr. Meister graduated from Harvard and received his medical degree from Cornell Medical College in New York, and served as chairman of the college's biochemistry department for 35 years. By the time he joined Cornell in 1957, Dr. Meister, who began his research at the National Institutes of Health in 1945 and later spent a year at Tufts University, had already established a lasting reputation. His ""Biochemistry of Amino Acids,"" a two-volume work published in 1957, is still considered the standard in its field. In the arcane world of science, Dr. Meister was something of an anomaly, a specialist in pure science with a flair for the practical applications of his work. Like a quarryman who designs cathedrals in his head, Dr. Meister had a feel for implications, most notably his suspicion that glutathione, an amino acid compound whose underlying chemistry he had studied thoroughly, could play an important role in the body's immune system. ""He had an instinct,"" is the way Dr. Herbert Tabor, a laboratory chief at the National Institutes for Health, put it yesterday. Dr. Meister's instinct was partly confirmed when it was discovered that people infected with the AIDS virus have reduced levels of glutathione, a ubiquitous compound of three amino acids that Dr. Meister found protects cells from oxidation by absorbing oxygen. As a result, Dr. Meister helped transform glutathione into a drug that has shown some initial promise of reducing the growth of the AIDS virus in laboratory tests. Clinical trials are continuing, but not even Dr. Meister believed that the key to AIDS would be as simple as replacing depleted supplies of glutathione. ""AIDS is simply not the result of glutathione deficiency,"" he said when the laboratory findings were reported in 1991. Whatever the results of that particular line of attack, Dr. Meister's research into glutathione has already broadened science's understanding of the immune system. He is survived by his wife, Leonora, of Woodbury, Conn.; two sons, Jonathan, of Philadelphia, and Kenneth, of Wilton, Conn., five grandchildren and a sister, Dr. Anna Burton of Fort Lee, N.J."

He was 76 years old. Mr. Lanson sang on the show from 1950 to 1957, replacing Frank Sinatra. The show was the television version of the long-running radio program ''Lucky Strike Hit Parade,'' and featured the top tunes of the week performed by the show's cast in a variety of costumes and settings. Other members of the cast at various times included the singers Dorothy Collins, Gisele MacKenzie and Russell Arms. 'It Was Very Clean' After leaving the show in 1957, Mr. Lanson sang in nightclubs and was the host of television variety shows in Atlanta and in Shreveport, La. ''Your Hit Parade'' continued until 1959 and was revived briefly in 1974. ''The show didn't have any stars per se and we all got along well,'' Mr. Lanson recalled in a 1979 interview. ''It was very clean and there was no suggestive dancing. A 5- or 6-year-old could watch it. And of course a lot of people watched it to see what song was No. 1 that week.'' ''I sang 'Mona Lisa' 13 straight weeks because it was a man's song and I was the only man on the show then,'' he said. His Life in Nashville Mr. Lanson had lived in Nashville since 1967 and sang at dances and similar functions. He also had a syndicated radio show that played big band music. In 1941, he recorded the hit ''By the Light of the Silvery Moon'' with the Ray Noble Band. A later hit, ''The Old Master Painter,'' helped him land the ''Hit Parade'' job. Mr. Lanson, whose name was originally Roy Landman, was born in Memphis and began singing in a church choir there as a boy. He was nicknamed Snooky at the age of 2 for the Irving Berlin tune ''Snooky-Ookums.'' He is survived by his wife, Florence; a daughter; two sons, and eight grandchildren."

He was 98 and had been in declining health, she said. Dr. Stanton was the right-hand man of William S. Paley, the tycoon who built the Columbia Broadcasting System empire from a handful of struggling radio stations in 1928. From 1946 to 1973, they operated as probably the greatest team in the history of broadcasting, making CBS, for a time, the most powerful communications company in the world, and the most prestigious. It was under Dr. Stanton and Mr. Paley that CBS, mixing entertainment programming with high-quality journalism and dashes of high culture, earned its reputation as the Tiffany Network. As a brilliant corporate builder and a technologically minded executive, Dr. Stanton -- everybody used the ''doctor'' -- played a pivotal role in CBS's rise. He did so despite a relationship with Mr. Paley that was often strained and an object of puzzlement to those around them. In her 1990 biography of Mr. Paley, ''In All His Glory,'' Sally Bedell Smith wrote: ''Temperamentally, the two men were opposites: Paley, the man of boundless charm, superficially warm but essentially heartless and self-absorbed; Stanton, the self-contained Swiss whose business acumen, decency and understated humor endeared him to his colleagues. ''Paley had a restless, readily satisfied curiosity while Stanton probed more deeply and was interested in a broader range of subjects,'' Ms. Smith continued. ''Paley acted from the gut; Stanton from the brain. Paley could be disorganized and unpredictable. Stanton was disciplined and systematic.'' The two men did not socialize. Ms. Smith wrote that Mr. Paley had resented Dr. Stanton's refusal to invite him to his home, calling his associate ''a closed-off, cold man.'' Dr. Stanton was admired by politicians, businessmen and fellow broadcasters as a principled executive with high aspirations. The industry turned to him to lead their battles against government involvement in radio and television programming. During the early days of television, when Mr. Paley clung to the idea that network radio would remain CBS's meal ticket, Dr. Stanton realized that the company's prosperity would rest with television and diversification into areas like the long-playing phonograph, whose growth he guided after its development by Peter Goldmark. In 1946, Dr. Stanton began charting CBS's sometimes painful growth as a television network. He was clear about what direction it should take. ''Television, like radio,'' Dr. Stanton said in 1948, ''should be a medium for the majority of Americans, not for any small or special groups; therefore its programming should be largely patterned for what these majority audiences like and want.'' Frank Nicholas Stanton was born on March 20, 1908, in Muskegon, Mich., the older of two sons of Frank Cooper Stanton, a woodworking and mechanics teacher, and the former Helen Schmidt. After his family moved to Dayton, Ohio, when he was a boy, Frank learned electronics at his father's workbench. Young Frank majored in zoology and psychology at Ohio Wesleyan University, graduating in 1930 intending to become a doctor. But finding medical school too expensive, he accepted a scholarship to Ohio State to study psychology and earned a master's degree in 1932. A year earlier, he married Ruth Stephenson, whom he had met at Sunday school when they were both 14. While he pursued a doctorate, studying ways to measure radio audiences, he invented a kind of forerunner of the Nielsen audimeter. Dr. Stanton's device could be installed inside a radio receiver to register what programs listeners were tuning in. Paul Kesten, a CBS executive, was so impressed that he offered Mr. Stanton a job in its two-man research department for $55 a week. The day after receiving his doctorate, in 1935, Dr. Stanton and his wife got in their Model A Ford and headed for New York. By 1938, Dr. Stanton had become CBS's research director with a staff of 100. With the social scientist Paul F. Lazarsfeld, he invented a device called the program analyzer, which enabled CBS to track the responses of 100 listeners to a radio program, gauging their likes and dislikes. CBS used it for a half-century. Dr. Stanton remained with the network during World War II while serving as a consultant to the Secretary of War, the Office of War Information and the Office of Facts and Figures. By 1945 he had become vice president and general manager of CBS. He became president the following year, at age 38, after Mr. Kesten, Mr. Paley's first choice for the job, declined. Mr. Kesten, citing poor health, recommended Dr. Stanton instead, and Mr. Paley invited Dr. Stanton to his Long Island estate. After dinner, they took a walk in the rain. Mr. Paley stunned his guest, saying, ''By the way, Frank, I want you to run the company.'' Mr. Paley said he wanted to be free of the day-to-day problems of running CBS. As president, Dr. Stanton reorganized CBS into separate divisions for radio, television and laboratories. Programming was Mr. Paley's domain, though Dr. Stanton was responsible for moving CBS's biggest radio star of the 1940s, Arthur Godfrey, into television and taking a chance on a hard-drinking comic named Jackie Gleason. ''I think if there was anything I wanted to do with the company and I proposed it, there was a pretty good chance I could go ahead and do it,'' Ms. Smith quoted Dr. Stanton as saying. But one person he could not control was Edward R. Murrow, CBS's most celebrated journalist. Mr. Murrow was close to Mr. Paley and repeatedly went over Dr. Stanton's head to discuss his plans or problems with Mr. Paley. Mr. Murrow regarded Dr. Stanton as a numbers-cruncher who knew little about news, and he tended to blame Dr. Stanton, not Mr. Paley, when management thwarted him. When Mr. Murrow's acclaimed weekly program ''See It Now'' began to lose sponsors, Mr. Paley stepped in and cut the program to 8 or 10 broadcasts a year, before taking it off the air in 1958. Mr. Murrow's diminishment seemed to elevate Dr. Stanton's standing as a force at CBS News. As network president, Dr. Stanton focused on the news division, creating an executive review board to keep news policy and editorializing separate. He combined the news and public affairs departments, increased the news department's budget and extended the nightly news to 30 minutes from 15 minutes. He also created the weekly investigative and news documentary program ''CBS Reports.'' In August 1958, the network was plunged into scandal after a contestant on the popular program ''The $64,000 Question'' revealed that he and others had been fed answers. Congressional and law-enforcement investigations were opened. Mounting his own investigation, Dr. Stanton forced the resignation of the executive responsible for the show and canceled the network's remaining quiz shows. Dr. Stanton saw diversification as necessary to CBS's growth. The network began acquiring companies, publishing magazines and books, and producing Broadway shows like ''My Fair Lady,'' and it bought the New York Yankees. (The Yankees fared poorly under CBS, which sold the team to investors led by George Steinbrenner.) Dr. Stanton oversaw the development of the network's symbol, the CBS Eye, designed by William Golden. And he was chiefly responsible for shepherding its headquarters, the Manhattan skyscraper known as Black Rock, into existence. He chose Eero Saarinen as the architect and fought with Mr. Paley over the austere International-style design, with its black exterior. Mr. Paley wanted the building to be pink. In dealing with the government, Dr. Stanton could count on powerful friends, including Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson. Yet he and Mr. Paley did not resist the anti-Communist hunts of the late 1940s and early 50s. In 1950, to reassure advertisers and pressure groups, Dr. Stanton approved requiring CBS employees to take an oath of loyalty to the United States. The next year, with Mr. Paley's approval, Dr. Stanton created a security office staffed by former F.B.I. agents to investigate the political leanings of employees. Writers, directors and others were blacklisted. Years later, in 1999, upon receiving an award for his efforts on behalf of the First Amendment, Dr. Stanton conceded that the network's response to pressure might not have been the best one. ''I didn't have the wisdom, nor did anyone else,'' Mr. Stanton said. ''The head of the law department was one of the fairest people I've ever known. When he said this was the course we should follow, we went along with it.'' With the 1960 presidential election approaching, Dr. Stanton persuaded Congress to suspend the ''equal time'' provision in the Communications Act, making it possible to televise debates between the Democratic nominee, Senator John F. Kennedy, and his Republican rival, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, without including candidates of smaller parties. Those debates signaled the arrival of television as a dominant force in presidential politics. Dr. Stanton bore much of the criticism when Washington objected to CBS News's coverage of the war in Vietnam, and was threatened with jail in 1971. CBS had broadcast an hourlong investigative report called ''The Selling of the Pentagon,'' about a $30 million campaign by the Defense Department to improve its image, and the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee demanded that he turn over material cut from the program. When he refused to comply, he was called before the committee. He said the order amounted to an infringement of free speech and freedom of the press under the First Amendment. ''If newsmen are told their notes, films and tapes will be subject to compulsory process so that the government can determine whether the news has been satisfactorily edited,'' he said, ''the scope, nature and vigor of their news reporting will be inevitably curtailed.'' The committee voted to cite him for contempt. But after an emotional debate, the full House rejected the committee's citation. When the Nixon administration began attacking the networks over their war coverage, it was often Dr. Stanton who answered. ''Stanton was a firewall between the presidency and the reporters covering the White House,'' said Robert Pierpoint, a former CBS White House correspondent. For years, Dr. Stanton believed he would get the top job at CBS -- chairman and chief executive -- when Mr. Paley reached age 65 in 1966. Mr. Paley had promised him the job, after all. Dr. Stanton was so certain that he rejected an opportunity to become head of the University of California and turned down President Johnson's offers to make him secretary of health, education and welfare or under secretary of state. But Mr. Paley continued as chairman past his retirement age, and the relationship between the two men was never the same. In 1967, Dr. Stanton signed a new contract, which required him to step down as president in 1971 to become vice chairman and to remain in the post until his retirement at 65 in 1973. After leaving that position, Dr. Stanton was chairman and chief operating officer of the American Red Cross for six years. He served on the boards of the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Institution, the Stanford Research Institute and Lincoln Center. He was also the first non-Harvard graduate in the 20th century to serve on the Harvard board, and he spent much of the rest of his life in Cambridge, Mass., working on university projects. He sat on the CBS board until 1978, then became a consultant until 1987, though he was seldom called on to consult. For all his accomplishments at CBS, Dr. Stanton had left the network in disillusion, disappointment and sorrow, assessing it as ''just another company with dirty carpets.'' When he retired in 1973, he left Black Rock quietly, refusing to allow Mr. Paley to give him a party. His parting"
54890,"David Lamb, Author and War Correspondent in Vietnam, Dies at 76","David Lamb, a dauntless foreign correspondent for The Los Angeles Times who also wrote critically acclaimed books about the Arab world and Africa, died on Sunday in Alexandria, Va.","David Lamb, a dauntless foreign correspondent for The Los Angeles Times who also wrote critically acclaimed books about the Arab world and Africa, died on Sunday in Alexandria, Va. He was 76. Sandy Northrop, his wife and only immediate survivor, said the cause was lymphoma and esophageal cancer. Mr. Lamb covered the front lines in Vietnam for United Press International and the fall of Saigon for The Times in 1975. Xan Smiley, a top editor at The Economist, characterized him as ''inexhaustibly gutsy.'' Mr. Lamb was credited with naming the site of a 10-day battle in the A Shau Valley in 1969 ''Hamburger Hill.'' A young G.I. had told him, ''With all this chopped-up red meat, it reminds me of a hamburger,'' and the name stuck. He returned to Vietnam in 1997 to open the newspaper's bureau in Hanoi, becoming the only American wartime newspaper correspondent to live there in peacetime. Mr. Lamb often embellished his books and articles with personal experience. Discovering once that his taxi driver had fought for the North Vietnamese, Mr. Lamb asked whether the cabby hated him because he was an American. ''We fought the Chinese for 1,000 years; we fought the French for 100,'' the cabby replied. ''You were here just for 10. You were just a blip in the history of a proud nation.'' He cobbled together observations like those into a 2002 book, ''Vietnam, Now: A Reporter Returns,'' and a PBS documentary, ''Vietnam Passage: Journeys From War to Peace,'' the same year. Mr. Lamb also wrote two domestic travelogues. For one, ''Stolen Season: A Journey Through America and Baseball's Minor Leagues'' (1991), he attended minor league games all over the country. For the other, ''Over the Hills: A Midlife Escape Across America by Bicycle'' (1996), he bicycled 3,145 miles from his home in Washington to Santa Monica, Calif., armed, he said, with two bottles of Scotch, a carton of cigarettes and an ample supply of ibuprofen. In ''The Arabs'' (1987), a portrait of a region and a people he came to know as a reporter, Mr. Lamb produced a compelling primer peppered with illuminating anecdotes. One passage revealed that King Fahd of Saudi Arabia had recruited the designer of a floating space city in ''Star Trek'' to refurbish his Boeing 747 with gold-plated hardware and a three-story elevator. ''Mr. Lamb has the first-rate reporter's essential tools -- his eyes and his ears,'' James F. Clarity, a correspondent for The New York Times, wrote about ''The Arabs'' in The Times Book Review, ''and he uses them to relate, sometimes with compelling detail, who the Arabs are, why they act the way they do and why the rest of the world, particularly the United States, has a stake in what they do that goes beyond oil prices.'' Mr. Lamb wrote his first book, ''The Africans'' (1983), after logging 300,000 miles through 48 countries during four years of covering the continent. He quoted James Richard Mancham, the first president of the Seychelles, as saying: ''Look at it this way, I'm alive. That's more than a lot of ex-presidents in Africa can say. Besides that, everyone had fun when I was president, and how many ex-presidents can say that?'' David Sherman Lamb was born on March 5, 1940, in Boston, the son of Ernest Lamb, a private investment manager, and the former Pauline Ayers. He began his career at 14, after writing to The Milwaukee Journal and volunteering to contribute a weekly column about his beloved Braves from the perspective of a teenager who had seen the team desert Boston for Milwaukee. The Journal's sports editor agreed, and David's father rented him a typewriter for $9 a month. He graduated from the School of Journalism at the University of Maine in 1962 and began his career on The Okinawa Morning Star. He worked in Las Vegas and Oakland, Calif.; reported for U.P.I. in San Francisco, Denver and Saigon; and was assigned to New York and Washington by The Los Angeles Times. He served as bureau chief in Cairo, Nairobi, Sydney and Hanoi before he left the paper in 2004 after 34 years. A world map in his office was stuck with 185 pins, one for each country he visited as a correspondent. During an unpaid leave from The Times, Mr. Lamb bought a used mobile home and spent a summer wandering the country for what became ''Stolen Season.'' ''This baseball journey was born in the rubble of Beirut while some maniacs were blowing away my hotel with tanks, chunk by chunk,'' he wrote. He said he told a colleague that if he survived, ''I'm going to find something to write about that's a million miles from Beirut. Like baseball.''"

Mr. Jamison joined Survivor in 1984, replacing Dave Bickler, two years after the group's biggest hit and only No. 1 single, ''Eye of the Tiger,'' the theme song to the Sylvester Stallone film ''Rocky III.'' With Mr. Jamison as lead vocalist, the band went on to have several more Top 10 hits, including ''Burning Heart'' (heard in ''Rocky IV'') and ''Is This Love,'' and remained a popular touring act. Mr. Jamison left and rejoined the band twice. He also sang and was a co-writer for ''I'm Always Here,'' the theme to the hit television series ''Baywatch.'' Born in Mississippi in 1951, Mr. Jamison sang with the bands Target and Cobra before joining Survivor."
51344,73,"Lanford Wilson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright whose work -- earthy, realist, greatly admired, widely performed -- centered on the sheer ordinariness of marginality, died on Thursday in Wayne, N.J.","Lanford Wilson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright whose work -- earthy, realist, greatly admired, widely performed -- centered on the sheer ordinariness of marginality, died on Thursday in Wayne, N.J. He was 73 and lived in Sag Harbor, on Long Island. The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Marshall W. Mason, a director and longtime collaborator who is widely considered the foremost interpreter of Mr. Wilson's work. One of the most distinguished American playwrights of the late 20th century, Mr. Wilson was considered instrumental in drawing attention to Off Off Broadway, where his first works were staged in the mid-1960s. He was also among the first playwrights to move from that milieu to renown on wider stages, ascending to Off Broadway, and then to Broadway with no Off's whatsoever, within a decade of his arrival in New York. His work has also long been a staple of regional theaters throughout the United States. Mr. Wilson won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for drama for ''Talley's Folly,'' which played 286 performances on Broadway that year. A one-act, two-character comedy set in his hometown, Lebanon, Mo., the play chronicled the romantic fortunes of a Jewish man (played by Judd Hirsch) and a Protestant woman (Trish Hawkins) in 1944. ''Talley's Folly'' was an installment in Mr. Wilson's Talley Cycle, an eventual trilogy. The cycle also comprised ''Talley & Son,'' which played Off Broadway in 1985 and also looked in on the Talley family in 1944; and ''Fifth of July,'' which takes up the family's story in 1977. ''Fifth of July,'' a comedy that explores the disillusionment of the Vietnam era, came to Broadway in November of 1980. The production, which starred Christopher Reeve as Kenneth Talley Jr., a gay, paraplegic Vietnam veteran, ran for 511 performances at the New Apollo Theater; it also starred Jeff Daniels and Swoosie Kurtz. Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Frank Rich wrote: ''Mr. Wilson has poured the full bounty of his gifts into this work, and they are the gifts of a major playwright. 'Fifth of July' is a densely packed yet buoyant outpouring of empathy, poetry and humor, all shaped into a remarkable vision.'' Mr. Wilson's other Broadway plays include ''Burn This'' (1987), ''Angels Fall'' (1983) and ''Redwood Curtain'' (1993). His Off Broadway work included ''The Hot l Baltimore,'' about the denizens of a down-at-the-heels residential hotel. The play was the basis of a short-lived television sitcom of the same name, broadcast on ABC in 1975. With Mr. Mason, Tanya Berezin and Rob Thirkield, Mr. Wilson founded the Circle Repertory Company, a highly regarded collective of actors, directors, playwrights and others known for its collaborative approach. Established in 1969 on the Upper West Side as the Circle Theater Company, it later moved to the Sheridan Square Playhouse in Greenwich Village. The company ceased operations in 1996. Besides producing work by Mr. Wilson, Circle Rep produced plays by Jules Feiffer, Sam Shepard, Larry Kramer and others. Actors associated with the company include William Hurt, Kathy Bates, Barnard Hughes, Cherry Jones and Cynthia Nixon. Stylistically, the distinguishing hallmark of Mr. Wilson's work was his dialogue -- authentic, gritty, often overlapping -- be it the speech of his native Missouri or adopted New York. To audiences, his approach gave the experience of eavesdropping on real, bustling people in real, bustling time. (As a young playwright honing his craft, he later explained, he would set himself exercises like writing down the overheard speech of five people talking at once.) Thematically, his work concerned dissolutions large and small: the rupture of societies, families and individual marriages; the loss of life, love, companionship and sanity. His characters, drawn true to life if sometimes larger, tended toward the socially marginalized, perhaps no surprise for a man whose identity -- Ozark, somewhat rootless, a child of a broken home, gay at a time when it was taboo to be gay -- no doubt made him feel pushed to the margins of mainstream culture himself. (Mr. Wilson was noted for being one of the first mainstream playwrights to create central, meaningful gay and lesbian characters.) Ragtag collections of prostitutes and pimps, drug addicts and sundry urban nighthawks, the people who populate his plays were unusual theatrical subjects in their day, but were no less sympathetic for that. In many respects, as he made clear in interviews, Mr. Wilson saw his work as the counterpart to the New Realism of post-1960 visual art, in which artists created works that were amalgams of images, often fragmentary, observed in the world around them and ripe for the taking. As he also made clear, the subject matter of many of his plays was drawn from his own life. Lanford Eugene Wilson was born in Lebanon on April 13, 1937; his parents divorced when he was a young child. He moved with his mother to Springfield, Mo., and, after she remarried a farmer, to Ozark, Mo. After studying briefly at Southwest Missouri State College, Mr. Wilson moved to San Diego, where his father was living. Their reunion -- not a happy one, though their relationship fared better in later years -- became the basis of ''Lemon Sky.'' That play, first performed in 1970 at the Studio Arena Theater in Buffalo, opened Off Broadway that year at the Playhouse Theater on West 48th Street, and was revived in 1985 at the Second Stage Theater. It was later adapted as a television movie, first broadcast in 1988 and starring Kevin Bacon as the youth who attempts to bond with his estranged father. In San Diego, the young Mr. Wilson worked at a desultory job in an aircraft plant and took classes at what was then San Diego State College. It was there, in a writing class, that he discovered dialogue and determined to become a writer of short stories. In the late 1950s, Mr. Wilson moved to Chicago, where he worked as a commercial artist in an advertising agency and took extension classes at the University of Chicago. He wrote a sheaf of short stories that were rejected by all the magazines to which he sent them, and made his first tentative stabs at writing plays. Mr. Wilson settled in New York in 1962. There, as the reference work Current Biography wrote in 1979, he ''saw and disliked every play on Broadway.'' He found the ersatz environment of Off Off Broadway, with its theater spaces shoehorned into coffeehouses and church basements, far more congenial. His first produced play, a one-act called ''So Long at the Fair,'' was staged at Caffe Cino, in the Village, in 1963. It concerned a young man, newly arrived in New York, and the young woman who hopes to seduce him. Reviewing the play, The Village Voice praised the ''exactness and inner logic'' of the dialogue. Over the years to come, Mr. Wilson's facility for dialogue proved both a great strength and an occasional weakness: critics sometimes took him to task for neglecting other aspects of dramatic construction, like tight plotting, in favor of the rush of pure spoken language. In 1965, Mr. Wilson attracted attention with ''The Madness of Lady Bright,'' also at Caffe Cino. Its protagonist, Leslie Bright, is a middle-aged gay man confronting a wistful past, a lonely present and an uncertain future. He garnered still wider attention for his first full-length play, ''Balm in Gilead,'' also staged in 1965, at La MaMa. The play, about low-life characters converging in the New York nightscape, was so successful that Ellen Stewart, La MaMa's founder, had to stand on the sidewalk each night and beseech an eager fire marshal not to close the theater, packed to capacity. His first play to come to Broadway was ''The Gingham Dog,'' about the dissolution of an interracial marriage. It ran for just 19 performances in 1969. Mr. Wilson was single at the time of his death. Survivors include two half-brothers, John and Jim, and a stepsister, Judy. In an interview quoted in The Times in 2002, Mr. Wilson expounded on his realist, quasidocumentary approach: ''I want people to see -- and to read -- my plays and to say: 'This is what it was like living in that place at that time. People haven't changed a damn bit. We can recognize everyone.' ''"

Jack Lucas, who at 14 lied his way into the military to serve in World War II and became the youngest marine ever to receive the Medal of Honor, died Thursday in Hattiesburg, Miss., where he made his home. He was 80. Mr. Lucas had been hospitalized with leukemia and died after asking doctors to remove a dialysis machine, said his wife, Ruby. Jacklyn Lucas, known as Jack, was just six days past his 17th birthday when, in February 1945, his heroism at Iwo Jima earned him the medal. He used his body to shield three members of his squad from two grenades and was nearly killed when one exploded. ''A couple of grenades rolled into the trench,'' Mr. Lucas said in an interview with The Associated Press shortly before he received the medal from President Harry S. Truman in October 1945. ''I hollered to my pals to get out and did a Superman dive at the grenades.'' But ''I wasn't a Superman after I got hit,'' he added, recalling the scream he let out ''when that thing went off.'' Mr. Lucas was left with more than 250 pieces of shrapnel in his body and had 26 operations in the following months. He was discharged as a private first class. The youngest member of the military to receive the Medal of Honor in any conflict other than the Civil War, he became a symbol of patriotism in the ensuing decades, meeting presidents and traveling the world to speak with frontline troops and fellow veterans. Mr. Lucas, born in Plymouth, N.C., on Feb. 14, 1928, was a 13-year-old cadet captain in a military academy when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Big for his age and eager to serve, he forged his mother's signature on an enlistment waiver that would have allowed him to join the Marines at 17 rather than the usual 18. But in fact he was by then only 14, though the military did not learn of that until censors discovered it through a letter he had written to his 15-year-old girlfriend. ''They had him driving a truck in Hawaii because his age was discovered, and they threatened to send him home,'' said D. K. Drum, who wrote Mr. Lucas's story with him in the 2006 book ''Indestructible.'' Mr. Lucas eventually stowed away aboard a Navy ship headed for combat in the Pacific. He turned himself in aboard ship to avoid being listed as a deserter, and volunteered to fight. The officers aboard ''did not know his age,'' Ms. Drum said. ''He didn't give it up, and they didn't ask.'' After the war, Mr. Lucas earned a business degree from High Point University in North Carolina and raised, processed and sold beef in the Washington area. In the 1960s, he rejoined the military, becoming an Army paratrooper to conquer his fear of heights, Ms. Drum said. On a training jump, both of his parachutes failed, she said, and Mr. Lucas later said his stocky build and a last-second roll as he hit the ground had saved his life. In addition to his wife, Mr. Lucas is survived by four sons, a daughter, seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren."
26392,"William A. Koshland, 90, Former Knopf President, Dies","William A. Koshland, chairman emeritus and former president of the publisher Alfred A. Knopf, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan.","William A. Koshland, chairman emeritus and former president of the publisher Alfred A. Knopf, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 90 and lived in Manhattan. The cause was cancer, said William T. Loverd, a senior vice president at Knopf, an autonomous division of Random House since 1960. Mr. Koshland, born in Boston and a 1928 graduate of Harvard College, began his career at Knopf in 1934. He soon established a close relationship with Alfred A. and Blanche W. Knopf, who founded the house in 1915 in Manhattan and turned its imprint into a seal of quality. Modesty was not Mr. Knopf's strong suit, which seemed fine with Mr. Koshland as he worked behind the scenes to extend and strengthen the firm's relations with authors, booksellers and publishers at home and abroad. He became a regular at the Frankfurt Book Fair well before many other American publishers marked it as a must on their calendars. He kept in touch with Knopf's foreign writers, including Thomas Mann, Brendan Behan and Elizabeth Bowen. Among the American authors he dealt with were Willa Cather, Ira Gershwin, John Hersey and Robert Nathan. Mr. Koshland achieved a major hit when he added ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" by Julia Child, Louisette Bertholle and Simone Beck to the fabled Knopf list in 1961. That first volume kindled a revolution in American kitchens as well as a lasting relationship with Julia Child and one of publishing's longest-running and most lucrative success stories. He was named president of Knopf in 1966 and succeeded Mr. Knopf as chairman in 1973. Mrs. Knopf died in 1966 and Mr. Knopf in 1984, having kept in touch with the editors about the editorial content and commercial fortunes of the Knopf list. Mr. Loverd, Knopf's publicity director, said that after Mr. Koshland's retirement 20 years ago he maintained contacts with foreign houses and some of the authors he had worked with, and advised on matters like royalties.

He was 79 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass. Mr. Guinier linked his intellectual prowess with what he once called ''my fight for a democratic America.'' This commitment to social equality and justice led him into a life of many facets. Sterling Stuckey, professor of history at the University of California at Riverside, today called Mr. Guinier a source of inspiration for black intellectuals across the nation. The last phase of his working life was at Harvard. He assumed his position there, a full professorship, in 1969, after the university, in response to the demands of black students, established the Department of Afro-American Studies. After his retirement in 1980, he became professor emeritus. Born in Panama of Jamaican parents, Mr. Guinier attended high school in Boston. In 1929 he entered Harvard College as a freshman; he was the only black student in the college. Because of his color, Mr. Guinier said, he was barred from the dormitories, was denied financial aid because he had failed to send his picture with his application, and was spoken to inside and outside of class by only one person. After two years he dropped out. He completed studies for a bachelor's degree at the City College of New York and received a master's degree from Columbia University and a law degree from New York University. In politics, Mr. Guinier, who lived in New York City before he returned to Cambridge, was the first black to receive a party's nomination for the Manhattan Borough presidency.

21825,Herbert von Karajan Is Dead; Musical Perfectionist Was 81,"Herbert von Karajan, probably the world's best-known conductor and one of the most powerful figures in classical music, died yesterday at his home in Anif, in the Austrian Alps.","Herbert von Karajan, probably the world's best-known conductor and one of the most powerful figures in classical music, died yesterday at his home in Anif, in the Austrian Alps. An aide reported that he suffered a heart attack in the early afternoon, and died before a rescue helicopter could fly him to a hospital. He was 81 years old. An official of the nearby Salzburg Festival, Rene Galle, said Mr. Karajan had been working eight hours a day rehearsing for a production of Verdi's ''Ballo in Maschera.'' He had shown no signs of ill health, other than the aftereffects of his many illnesses in recent years, which included a stroke, three back operations and severe circulatory difficulties. Tributes to the legendary maestro came from many quarters. ''With him, the music world has lost one of its greats,'' said the Austrian Chancellor, Franz Vranitzky. A 'Magic Carpet' for Singers The American soprano Jessye Norman, in Paris for the bicentennial of the French Revolution, said: ''Herbert von Karajan always rolled out a magic carpet for us, the singers. With him, our musical work took on another dimension.'' Hans Landesmann, a Salzburg Festival board member, said the festival would open as scheduled on July 27, but with a tribute to Mr. Karajan, who had been its dominant spirit for 25 years. Mr. Karajan's life was hardly untouched by controversy. His membership in the Nazi party from 1933, his lack of overt repentance for his thriving career during the Nazi years and his imperious personality made him many enemies. Turmoil in Berlin While he was always deeply respected as a conductor, some critics found his music-making increasingly slick and overrefined in his last decades. And his final years were clouded by a series of bitter battles with the Berlin Philharmonic, the West Berlin ensemble whose ''conductor for life'' he became in 1955. He abruptly resigned his Berlin post in April of this year, citing ill health. Still, no one would deny his position in the topmost ranks of 20th-century conductors. Inspired to conduct at the age of 20 when he heard Arturo Toscanini in Vienna, and Wilhelm Furtwangler's great rival from the early 1940's until the older maestro's death in 1954, Mr. Karajan once said that he had attempted to combine ''Toscanini's precision with Furtwangler's fantasy.'' Mr. Karajan could not properly be considered simply the last of a long line of soulful Germanic conductors stretching from Richard Wagner through Hans von Bulow, Gustav Mahler, Arthur Nikisch, Karl Muck, Furtwangler and Hans Knappertsbusch. He had a particular gift for Wagner and above all for Bruckner, whose music he conducted with sovereign command and elevated feeling. His final visit to New York, three concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall in February, included Bruckner's Eighth Symphony, which earned him a deeply deserved ovation. Friend of Brisk Tempos But Mr. Karajan also breathed a contemporary air - not so much in that he championed contemporary music, although he played his share, but in his absorption of the modernist fashion for brisk tempos and linear, intense music-making. In that, he was truly as much the heir of Toscanini as of Furtwangler. But Mr. Karajan was always more than a mere conductor: he was a man of enormous energy and careerist determination, and he managed at his peak, in the late 1950's and early 60's, to tower over European musical life as no one had done before or is likely to do again. His nickname at the time was ''the general music director of Europe,'' leading the Berlin Philharmonic, La Scala in Milan, London's Philharmonia Orchestra, the Vienna State Opera and the Salzburg Festival. He resigned the Vienna post in 1964, but founded the Salzburg Easter Festival in 1967 and served as artistic adviser to the Orchestre de Paris in 1969-70. ''The Karajan industry bears about the same relation to postwar European music that Krupp bore to prewar European steel production,'' wrote Martin Mayer in The New York Times Magazine in 1967. The classic, if perhaps apocryphal, Karajan anecdote had the conductor leaping into a taxi and, when asked his destination, replying: ''No matter. I am in demand everywhere.'' No Aversion to Fame Aside from his concerts and his increasingly frequent stage direction of his opera productions, Mr. Karajan was eager to use the mass media to further the cause of music and, incidentally, himself. Although he stood only 5 feet 8 inches tall, his classically sculptured face, his shock of first iron-gray, then white hair and his dreamy, eyes-closed podium manner made him an acknowledged authority figure and a natural for films and television. He also made more than 800 recordings, more than any other conductor. Deutsche Grammophon, the West German record company that shared him with EMI, an English label, said his albums sold ''probably hundreds of millions'' of copies. Der Spiegel, the West German newsweekly, reported that the conductor earned more than $6 million annually from record sales and conducting fees. In the 1970's, Mr. Karajan perfected what seemed like a totally self-contained circuit of performances and recordings. He would record an opera, then use the recording in rehearsals at the Salzburg Easter Festival, then videotape the performances and, often, the rehearsals. Laboring over the tapes in his home editing studio, he told his American biographer, Roger Vaughan, that ''making this review of my music is like a religion for me.'' A Basic Mastery Yet for all the tales of arrogance and self-indulgence, Mr. Karajan remained a masterly conductor, with a grasp of the standard orchestral and operatic repertory from Mozart through Schoenberg that was unsurpassed among his peers. Always a champion of Mozart, Beethoven - whose symphony cycle he recorded three times -Wagner and Bruckner, he gradually extended his grasp to include Mahler and even Schoenberg. He was also a lifelong admirer of Italian opera and, contrary to his domineering image, a champion of young talent, from the American soprano Leontyne Price (who called him ''one of the kindest men I ever met'') to the Soviet pianist Yevgeny Kissin, whom he conducted in his last Berlin Philharmonic concert on New Year's Eve. When critics complained that his performances in his later years had grown overrefined, he replied that ''if the details are right, the performance will work.'' And to the very end, he drew playing of the utmost tonal beauty from his orchestras. The Berlin Philharmonic is widely regarded as the world's pre-eminent orchestra, if any one ensemble can stake that claim. And his performances at Carnegie Hall with the Vienna Philharmonic drew almost astonished enthusiasm from veteran observers for their sonic sumptuousness, even if not all the critics praised the musical results. Herbert von Karajan was born in Salzburg on April 5, 1908, the son of Ernst von Karajan, the city's chief medical officer and an avid musical amateur, and Martha Kosmac von Karajan. The young Karajan played the piano at 3 and gave his first piano recital at 8. He studied music at the Salzburg Mozarteum and at Vienna University, with a brief detour while he devoted himself to engineering. A Debut in Mozart Following his encounter with Toscanini, he studied conducting with Franz Schalk and made his debut on March 2, 1929, leading Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro'' in the Austrian city of Ulm, where he remained as a staff conductor for five years. In 1933, Mr. Karajan joined the Nazi party, which had come to power in Germany but not yet in his native Austria. He insisted later that he had joined in 1935, had done so for strictly careerist reasons and had retained his membership only briefly. But at his post-war ''de-Nazification'' trial by the Allies, it was proven that he had in fact joined in 1933 in Vienna, and had joined again 1934 in Germany, after the party had been banned in Austria. He was also known to include the ''Horst Wessel'' song in his concerts and to perform other Nazi musical doggerel. In 1934, he was appointed general music director of the German city of Aachen, and a performance of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' at the Berlin State Opera in 1937 marked a turning point in his career. Thereafter he was active in the German capital, favored by Hermann Goring in a cultural power struggle with Joseph Goebbels, who backed Furtwangler. A Flight to Italy The fact that the conductor's second wife, Anna Maria Sauest, was a ''Mischling 2. Grades'' in Nazi terminology, meaning that she had a Jewish grandfather, had no apparent impact on Mr. Karajan's career - although his still-mysterious flight to Italy in 1944 has suggested to some that he had fallen afoul of the Nazis. After the war, Mr. Karajan was forbidden by the Allies to conduct for two years, and his first concerts in the United States in 1955 aroused picketing and protests. His international career began in conjunction with Walter Legge, the English record producer and husband of the German soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Legge had founded the Philharmonia as a recording orchestra in 1945, and Mr. Karajan became its first star conductor. Inexorably, he expanded his career to nearly every capital of the Western world. He conducted Wagner's ''Ring des Nibelungen'' at the Bayreuth Festival, in Vienna and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, although that cycle was completed without him, following a dispute. Three-Part Contention The tripod on which his mature career rested remained West Berlin, Vienna and his native Salzburg, even though there was discord in each of those cities. He resigned the Vienna State Opera post in 1964, after a particularly distinguished tenure there, although eventually he repaired his relations with the Vienna Philharmonic, which is the State Opera orchestra in its concert-giving mode. At Salzburg, he used the Berlin Philharmonic after his break with Vienna, and founded the Easter Festival in part to create his own bailiwick when he was at odds with the Viennese cultural bureaucrats. Even in recent years, he battled with the Salzburg Festival authorities, resigning from the board and threatening a complete break if his veto power - used to reaffirm the festival's essentially conservative direction - was not observed. But his most widely publicized controversies came in West Berlin. Basically, his disputes with that orchestra derived from divergent interpretations of the term ''conductor for life.'' Mr. Karajan wished to maintain as complete control as possible, perpetuating an authoritarian conductorial tradition that has died out nearly everywhere else. The orchestra, which is self-governing, resisted Mr. Karajan's dictatorial tendencies, while recognizing his gifts, his prestige and his undiminished appeal to concertgoers and record buyers. Fight Over a Clarinetist The most notorious of his Berlin disputes began in 1982, when Mr. Karajan attempted to hire the 23-year-old Sabine Meyer as deputy first clarinetist. The orchestra resisted the inclusion of a woman in its ranks, offering musical explanations for their decision. Eventually, Miss Meyer withdrew her candidacy and Mr. Karajan - after a few flamboyant humiliations of the Philharmonic, including a last-minute replacement of the German orchestra by the Vienna Philharmonic at the 1984 Salzburg Festival - eventually capitulated. Thereafter, however, he engaged in continual squabbling with the Berlin orchestra and the West Berlin Senate over his rights and obligations. With the ascension of the left-wing Green party in the latest West Berlin elections, Mr. Karajan's position grew even more tenuous, and he resigned in April. Mr. Karajan complemented his glamorous podium image with a glamorous life style. An avid sportsman, he skied and sailed and piloted his own airplanes. Fascinated by technical innovations, he once contemplated being frozen for 15 years so that he could re-record the standard repertory in the latest video and audio technology. In his later years he had homes in Anif, St. Moritz, Switzerland, and St. Tropez, France, and he and his third wife, the former French model Eliette Mouret, made an attractive target for paparazzi. Yet the conductor also had a spiritual side, and was a 40-year student of yoga and Zen Buddhism. He believed in reincarnation, and once dreamed of being reborn as an eagle, soaring above his beloved Alps. He is survived by his wife and their two daughters, Isabelle, 29, and Arabelle, 25. Funeral arrangements were not yet known."

She was 84. The cause was brain cancer, her family said. Mrs. Rogovin's years as a teacher made her a believer in letting a child learn by doing, whether it led to things made or knowledge acquired. As a classroom teaching aide she devised what she called learning boards to stimulate the senses. She came up with more than 100 of them, evoking tastes and smells with foods and spices, or putting common utensils to their proper uses, or conjuring up weather with cardboard clouds. Her work led to two exhibitions -- ""Learning By Doing"" (1971) and ""Please Do Touch"" (1977) -- at a Buffalo gallery. It also prompted her first book, ""Learning by Doing: An Illustrated Handbook for Parents and Teachers of Children Who Learn Slowly"" (Mafex, 1971; Ideal Publications, 1977). She organized workshops for parent groups, and her articles began to appear in newspapers and periodicals. Her writings found a national response and went through various editions into the 1990's. They included ""Let Me Do It!"" with an introduction by Benjamin Spock (1990); ""Dear Parents: Letters to Parents of Young Children"" (Highsmith, 1995); ""1001 Activities for Children,"" with a foreword by Edward Asner (Random House, 1999); and ""Turn Off the TV And . . ."" with a foreword by Charles Kuralt. Anne Snetsky was born in Buffalo and graduated in 1940 from the State College for Teachers, now part of SUNY Buffalo, where she also received a master's degree, magna cum laude, in special education in 1963. She and her husband, Milton Rogovin, suffered professionally in the 1950's as activists of the political left who protested the trial andsentencing of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Mr. Rogovin, an optometrist, lost his practice and became a nationally known documentary photographer; Mrs. Rogovin, refusing to sign the mandatory loyalty declaration, was unemployable in the Buffalo school system. Instead, she taught mentally retarded children in the Buffalo region for the state's Board of Cooperative Educational Services for about 30 years, even as her writing career flourished. In addition to her husband, whose work is currently on special exhibition at the New-York Historical Society, she is survived by two daughters, Ellen R.

Mr. Forbes spent 41 years with Con Edison, joining the company in 1924, when it was the New York Edison Company, as an assistant to the chief electrical engineer. In 1932, he was named systems engineer. As systems engineer and later as vice president, Mr. Forbes was chiefly responsible for the coordination of Con Edison's gas, electric and steam engineering. After World War II, he directed a $530 million expansion program in which the company created new plants and improved existing ones. He was named president in 1955 and chairman in 1957. He retired in December 1965. Two Major Power Failures Mr. Forbes remained with the utility as a consultant on two major projects with which he had been associated - a planned reservoir for powering hydro-electric generators at Storm King Mountain and the importation of huge amounts of electricity from Labrador. Both projects were later abandoned. Mr. Forbes was in charge during two major power failures in the 1960's. In 1961, a blackout left five square miles in New York City without electricity. In the other, a power failure that began in upstate New York cut power to most of the Eastern Seaboard for 13 hours in November 1965. The failure, which occurred just before Mr. Forbes retired, led to criticism of the utility for not removing itself from the regional power grid during a critical 10-minute period before the blackout hit New York City. Mr. Forbes, who was born in Colebrook, N.H., in 1898, earned a bachelor's degree from the University of New Hampshire and a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was an electrical engineering instructor. He then joined the design and testing staff of the Western Electric Company.

Unit Tracking Stolen Art","Donald Louis Mason, an F.B.I.","Donald Louis Mason, an F.B.I. agent whose fascination with art inspired him to create a loosely organized unit within the bureau's major theft squad in New York that became the scourge of art thieves in the 1970's, died on Aug. 10 at his home in Haworth, N.J. He was 74. The cause was cancer, said his wife, Eleanor. Although Mr. Mason had no formal training in art, he was an enthusiastic museumgoer and, his wife said, ""was fascinated by all forms of art."" Much of his work was undercover, said Margot Dennedy, an agent who was drawn into the art-theft unit by Mr. Mason and who is now a vice president of Sotheby's, the auction house. ""I can remember a time when I went to Connecticut with him. We were posing as prospective clients to buy a stolen Arshile Gorky painting. The guy went to jail. Mason knew what he was doing."" Among Mr. Mason's achievements was recovering a Fantin-Latour painting stolen from John F. Kennedy International Airport. ""You seem O.K., but you could be an F.B.I. agent,"" said one of the thieves in trying to sell the work to Mr. Mason, who had posed as an art appraiser. On another case, again posing as an art appraiser, he went to a hotel room to inspect a stolen painting. Outside fellow agents waited for the opening of the draperies in the hotel room windows: the signal for them to rush in. Studying the painting, Mr. Mason complained to the thieves that he needed more light. Obligingly, one of them threw open the drapes, bringing on the Federal agents. In a widely publicized case in 1976 the film director Otto Preminger reported to the New York City police that a Kandinsky painting, ""Leise Deutung"" (""Soft Interpretations""), had been stolen from his New York office. Mr. Mason became involved in the case and traced the painting from New York to Philadelphia, back to New York and finally to Basel, Switzerland, where it was seized and returned to a jubilant Mr. Preminger. An advertising salesman was charged in connection with the theft. Mr. Mason, then 51, was jubilant, too. ""Today is my last day before I retire,"" he said, winding up a 25-year career in the F.B.I. ""And I can't think of a more satisfying way to go out."" Mr. Mason then became a private consultant on art security. His clients included the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Newberry Library in Chicago and the Art Institute of Chicago. He was also a consultant for the Central Archive for Stolen Art, established by the International Foundation for Art Research, a scholarly organization focused on authentication and attribution. Mr. Mason was born in Bristol, Conn. He earned a bachelor's degree in physical education from Arnold College in Hartford in 1950 and a master's in education from New York University. In World War II he was a radio operator in the Navy.

He was 90. A native of Detroit and a 1928 graduate of Amherst College, Dr. Inglis received a doctorate in physics from the University of Michigan in 1931. He was an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University when he was recruited for the Ballistics Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and, later, for the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb at Los Alamos, N.M. After the war he joined the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois as the leader of a team of nuclear theorists. But a growing concern over the spread of atomic arsenals prodded him to become an outspoken advocate of nuclear disarmament. To that end he joined the Federation of American Scientists as its founding chairman in the late 1950's. He and other spokesmen for the group pleaded the cause of a controlled worldwide ban on nuclear weapons on Capitol Hill and before the public. Dr. Inglis joined the faculty at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1969. A particular interest was generating power using wind. He wrote several books on nuclear power and alternative energy sources. He became an emeritus professor in 1975. Dr. Inglis's wife, Dorothy, died two years ago. He is survived by a son, John, of Orange, Tex.; a sister, Carol Spicer, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and two grandsons."

He was 79 years old. A tall and personable baritone, Mr. Watson made his Broadway debut in 1928 with the Marx Brothers in ''Animal Crackers.'' He also appeared in ''Strike Me Pink'' with Jimmy Durante and Lupe Velez, Earl Carroll's ''Vanities,'' ''Something for the Boys'' and ''Saluta'' with Milton Berle. During the run of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Oklahoma!'' Mr. Watson played the leading role of Curley. Singing Led to Stage He was a native of California and a graduate of San Jose State College. He was discovered in the 1920's by Paul Ash, a popular orchestra leader. Mr. Watson joined the band as a singer and when he appeared with it at the Paramount Theater, Sam Harris, the producer, saw him and signed him for the juvenile role in ''Animal Crackers.'' In 1935, Mr. Watson was featured as Miltie Wiltie in the Burns-and-Allen radio broadcasts. He was also a featured singer on the ''Evening in Paris'' radio program that starred Al Jolson. During the 1939 World's Fair, he was featured with Abbott and Costello and Gypsy Rose Lee in a tabloid version of ''The Streets of Paris,'' which was presented in the Hall of Music.

17939,"Alexis Weissenberg, Pianist of Fire and Ice, Dies at 82","Alexis Weissenberg, a charismatic Bulgarian-born pianist known for his thundering aggressiveness and rational detachment at the keyboard, and for his unapologetic defense of those traits in interviews, died on Sunday in Lugano, Switzerland.","Alexis Weissenberg, a charismatic Bulgarian-born pianist known for his thundering aggressiveness and rational detachment at the keyboard, and for his unapologetic defense of those traits in interviews, died on Sunday in Lugano, Switzerland. He was 82. The Bulgarian Ministry of Culture confirmed the death to The Associated Press, which reported that Mr. Weissenberg had been ill with Parkinson's disease. Information on survivors was not available. In a career that began in the late 1940s, Mr. Weissenberg appeared as a soloist with the world's leading orchestras, played recitals on celebrated stages and made many recordings. A naturalized French citizen, he was a Romantic specialist, most closely associated with Schumann, Chopin and perhaps especially Rachmaninoff, whose percussive pyrotechnics suited him. Mr. Weissenberg's cool yet blazing approach divided reviewers. Where some heard impeccable technique, others heard soulless efficiency. Where some embraced the drama of his interpretations, others condemned them for aggressiveness. On these points, however, nearly everyone agreed: Mr. Weissenberg possessed a technical prowess rivaled by few other pianists. The ice of his demeanor at the keyboard (he sat, leaned forward and got down to business, playing with scarcely a smile or grimace) was matched by the fire that came off the keys. He could play very fast, and very loud. (Over time, verbs used to characterize his pianism included ''barrel,'' ''tear,'' ''thunder'' and ''let loose.'') Reviewing a 1982 Carnegie Hall recital by Mr. Weissenberg in The New York Times, Bernard Holland called his rendition of Bach's ''Chromatic Fantasy'' ''chillingly scientific.'' He added: ''It was anatomy instruction conducted by a master -- a brilliant dissection of cold, gray, gleaming flesh, from which every trace of living blood had been conscientiously squeezed away.'' To his critics, Mr. Weissenberg had no shortage of articulate rejoinders. In a 1983 interview with The Globe and Mail of Canada, he had this to say about his unemotional stage demeanor: ''You cannot lose your control physically and be precise as to what your hands do. Can you imagine a surgeon operating on somebody, and swooning and looking up at the ceiling and being very excited about it? The patient would die. That is what happens in music too. The patient dies, because there's too much going on besides the actual performance.'' In any case, as reviews over many years made clear, Mr. Weissenberg did sometimes give performances, or make recordings, that were simply, electrically, unequivocally breathtaking. Alexis Sigismond Weissenberg was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, on July 26, 1929. (He was billed as Sigi Weissenberg early in his career.) An only child, he was reared by his mother, a pianist from whom he took his first lessons. In 1941, after Bulgaria allied itself with the Axis Powers, Sigi and his mother, who were Jewish, attempted to cross into Turkey using false papers. As Mr. Weissenberg recounted in an autobiographical essay on his Web site, alexisweissenberg.com, they were detained for several months at a concentration camp on the border. With the aid of a sympathetic German officer, who loved the Schubert that Sigi played on an accordion he had managed to bring with him, they were able to escape. Mother and son made their way to Istanbul and eventually to Palestine. There, Sigi, already a fine pianist, performed with the Palestine Symphony and other orchestras. After the war, the young Mr. Weissenberg moved alone to New York, where he studied at the Juilliard School with the pianist Olga Samaroff and the composer Vincent Persichetti. In 1947, at 18, he won the Leventritt Award, a prestigious international music prize. He made his New York debut the next year at Carnegie Hall, playing Chopin's E minor concerto with the New York Philharmonic under George Szell. In the mid-1950s, Mr. Weissenberg moved to France. By then, critical opinion had begun to dog him, and engagements on major stages were drying up. He took a long sabbatical from public performance, spending a decade teaching and studying. ''As a young artist I learned new works very fast and played them much too soon,'' he told Newsweek in 1977. ''In 10 years I would have reached a point where my whole repertory would have been overplayed and understudied. I did not want to end up at the age of 50 still a 'promising' pianist.'' He re-emerged in the mid-1960s, and by the 1970s was again performing widely. Mr. Weissenberg's recordings include the complete Beethoven concertos with Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic. He also wrote music for the piano; an album of Mr. Weissenberg's compositions was recorded by the pianist Simon Mulligan for the Nimbus label in 2001. That Mr. Weissenberg's artistry was not to every taste was a subject about which he could eventually wax coolly philosophical. ''I still don't know why my playing is considered so disturbing,'' he told The Times in 1983. ''I remember in school, as a child, I learned that the flame of a candle is composed of a yellow light, which actually burns, and a blue light within it, which is ice cold. That is true of human beings as well. Perhaps it is the sight of that blue light in me that frightens certain people.''"

52977,"Ora Smith, 92, a Leading Expert And Researcher on Potatoes, Dies","Ora Smith, for many years the world's leading expert on potatoes, died on Feb. 4 at a nursing home in Ithaca, N.Y.","Ora Smith, for many years the world's leading expert on potatoes, died on Feb. 4 at a nursing home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 92. His family said the cause was pneumonia. Dr. Smith's technical innovations helped to make possible the mass production of potato chips and frozen french fries, which then gained wide popularity as snack foods. He was an emeritus professor of vegetable crops at Cornell University and was fondly known on campus as Mr. Potato. Experimenting in a modest basement laboratory, he researched improvements in the growing, storage and processing of potatoes. His findings helped to improve quality and to reduce waste and costs. When he began his studies in the 1940's, only 2 percent of the nation's potato crop was sold for commercial processing. Now nearly two-thirds of it is processed for consumption. To Inhibit Sprouting Among his contributions, Dr. Smith discovered a chemical to inhibit potato eyes from sprouting during storage and another additive to prevent cooked potatoes from turning a sickly gray. He tinkered with amino acids to bring out the tastiest flavor. Because potatoes with high water content are not ideal for processing, he invented the potato hydrometer, a device measuring moisture. And because potatoes with high sugar levels turn an unappetizing dark brown when fried, he applied a simple sugar test for sampling potatoes. Dr. Smith was a past president of the Potato Association of America and was honored by the National Potato Council and the European Association for Potato Research. He was the founding research director of the Potato Chip Institute International, now the Snack Food Institute, a post he held for 26 years. He wrote a book on potatoes and was the co-author of a text on potato processing, both of which remain standard references. He wrote more than 500 articles for scientific journals and general publications, including the entry on potatoes for the Encyclopedia Britannica. New Generation of Experts As a teacher, he trained a new generation of experts. They included Dr. Richard L. Sawyer, founder and director of the International Center for Potato Research in Lima, Peru, the world headquarters for potato studies. In World War II, Dr. Smith helped the Army by working on the improvement of the color of dehydrated potatoes for military food. He also served on a farm commission for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, worked as a consultant to the United States Department of Agriculture and visited many foreign countries in his research. Dr. Smith, a native of Freeburg, Ill., graduated from the University of Illinois in 1923. He earned a master's degree from Iowa State University in 1924 and a doctorate in plant physiology from the University of California in 1929. He joined Cornell in 1930 and formally retired in 1967 but continued his work until recent years. Surviving are his wife of 65 years, the former Dr. Laura Lee Weisbrodt, an emeritus professor of hotel administration at Cornell; a son, Dr. James S., of Coatesville, Pa.; a daughter, Sarah Jane Burton of Guelph, Ontario; a brother, Waldo, of Beardstown, Ill.; nine grandchildren and one great-grandchild."
214,"Leonid Zhabotinsky, Strongman for the Ages, Dies at 77","Leonid Zhabotinsky, a record-breaking Ukrainian-born Soviet weight lifter who picked up Olympic gold medals in 1964 and 1968 and was Arnold Schwarzenegger's teenage idol, died on Thursday in Zaporozhye, Ukraine.","Leonid Zhabotinsky, a record-breaking Ukrainian-born Soviet weight lifter who picked up Olympic gold medals in 1964 and 1968 and was Arnold Schwarzenegger's teenage idol, died on Thursday in Zaporozhye, Ukraine. He was 77. His death was announced by his son Ruslan, who did not specify a cause, according to the International Weightlifing Federation. Even in the sport of superheavy weight lifting, where superlatives are not taken lightly, Zhabotinsky's sobriquets -- Big Zhabo and the Strongest Man of the World -- seemed like understatements. He was nearly 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighed as much as 365 pounds. He marched in the opening parade of the 1968 Mexico City Olympics gripping the 40-pound pole bearing the red and gold Soviet hammer-and-sickle banner in only one hand, while every other flag-bearer needed two. ''He stole the show,'' recalled Mr. Schwarzenegger, the weight lifter, bodybuilder, actor and former California governor, who as a teenager in Austria kept a photograph of Zhabotinsky taped over his bed. ''He was extraordinary, another form of inspiration: If he can make it, I can make it.'' Zhabotinsky earned a bronze medal at his first Ukrainian state championship in 1957 and in 1963 broke his first of 19 world superheavyweight records. In 1974 he set his last, with a snatch of nearly 409 pounds. In 1964 he faced off against an archrival and Soviet teammate, Yuri Vlasov, who was defending his Olympic title in Tokyo. With one lift remaining in the competition's three events, the press, the snatch and the clean and jerk, Zhabotinsky rattled Vlasov by deliberately underperforming, then returned and broke his own clean and jerk record to win a gold medal. He took a second gold medal in 1968 in Mexico City, after another theatrical display. ''He came out for the snatch staring straight ahead,'' Robert Lipsyte wrote in The New York Times, ''his golden-tipped curly hair glistening atop the mushy, mobile face that seemed to munch on itself, now sly, now terrified, always about to fall apart like raw marble beneath the chisel of a clumsy sculptor. Up, Up, upupupup, he roared as he snatched 170 kilos, an Olympic record. ''He lowered the bar, and waited on the platform for a coach to come out and rub his thighs back to life. Then he limped heavily offstage, to hysterical applause. He lifted only once in the clean and jerk, 207.5 kilos, 10 kilos lower than his jerk record, but enough to give him a total of 572.5 to tie his total record. ''Why, someone asked, hadn't he tried to break his own record instead of just tying it? ''The great face crumbled, reassembled, the shoulders shrugged in twin volcanos. '' 'What for?' he asked.'' Hailing from a Cossack family, Leonid Ivanovich Zhabotinsky was born in Uspenska, Ukraine, on Jan. 28, 1938. His father, Ivan Philipovich, was an amateur athlete. His parents were not ''outstanding in their physiques,'' he told the Soviet magazine Amateur Athlete in 1967, adding that he bore a greater resemblance to his grandfather. His family moved to Kharkov, where they endured the Nazi occupation. After the eighth grade, he quit school and got a job in a tractor plant. He took evening courses to finish high school, became a state shot-put champion, and began studying as a teenager under Mikhail Svetlichny, who was both the factory's resident weight-lifting trainer and a poet. In 1969 Zhabotinsky was sidelined by surgery; after earning a doctorate from the Kharkov Pedagogical Institute, he returned to the sport in 1973. He set his last world record in 1974 at the Moscow Championship of the Soviet Army. He went on to coach the Soviet Army in weight lifting and left the military in 1991 as a colonel. He later worked for the Moscow Institute of Business and Law. In addition to his son Ruslan, survivors include his wife, Raisa, and another son, Vilen. Both his sons are weight lifters."

4687,"Geraldine Doyle, 86, Iconic Face of World War II","Geraldine Hoff Doyle, who was believed to be the unwitting model for the ''We Can Do It!''","Geraldine Hoff Doyle, who was believed to be the unwitting model for the ''We Can Do It!'' poster of a woman flexing her biceps in a factory during World War II -- an image that later became a symbol for the American feminist movement -- died on Sunday in Lansing, Mich. She was 86. The cause was complications of arthritis, said her daughter Stephanie Gregg. Mrs. Doyle was unaware of the poster's existence until 1982, when, while thumbing through a magazine, she saw a photograph of it and recognized herself. Her daughter said that the face on the poster was her mother's, but that the muscles were not. ''She didn't have big, muscular arms,'' Mrs. Gregg said. ''She was 5-foot-10 and very slender. She was a glamour girl. The arched eyebrows, the beautiful lips, the shape of the face -- that's her.'' In 1942, when she was 17, Geraldine Hoff took a job as a metal presser at a factory near her home in Inkster, Mich., near Detroit, to aid the war effort, Mrs. Gregg said. One day, a United Press photographer came in to shoot images of working women. The resulting poster, designed by the graphic artist J.Howard Miller, was used in a Westinghouse Company campaign to deter strikes and absenteeism. It was not widely seen until the early 1980s, when it was embraced by feminists. She quit the factory job after about two weeks because she learned that another woman had damaged her hands while using the metal presser, and she feared that such an injury would prevent her from playing the cello, her daughter said. At one of her next jobs, at a soda fountain, she met her husband, Leo H. Doyle, a dental student. They had been married for 66 years when he died this year. In addition to Mrs. Gregg, she is survived by four other children, 18 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren."
55411,"Kim Gallagher, 38, Olympic Track Medalist","Kim Gallagher, a slim but strong runner who overcame endless illnesses to win a silver medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and a bronze in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, died Monday in a Philadelphia hospital.","Kim Gallagher, a slim but strong runner who overcame endless illnesses to win a silver medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and a bronze in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, died Monday in a Philadelphia hospital. She was 38 and lived in Oreland, Pa. The cause of death was a stroke, her husband, John Corcoran, said. She learned she had colon cancer after the 1988 Olympics and stomach cancer in 1995. In remission from colon cancer, she resumed running and last competed in the 1992 United States Olympic trials. Both Olympic medals came at 800 meters, and Gallagher was the only American woman or man to win an individual track medal in Seoul at a distance longer than 400 meters. Her 1988 Olympic time of 1 minute 56.91 seconds still ranks as the third fastest by an American woman at 800 meters, behind Jearl Miles-Clark (1:56.40) and Mary Decker Slaney (1:56.90). Her athletic success was remarkable considering her health. Six months before the 1984 Olympics, she had surgery for multiple cysts on her ovaries caused by an estrogen imbalance. The condition reappeared until it was finally relieved by hormone treatment. Years later, when colon cancer was diagnosed, Gallagher rejected her doctor's recommendation of surgery and chemotherapy, treating it with vitamins, diet and rest. The cancer went into remission, then reappeared in 1994. A year later, she said: ""I'm fine, I'm healthy, I'm strong. But I really can't work a full day. I get tired."" In 1996, she used a wheelchair, but she refused to see doctors and improved enough to walk with a cane. Kimberly Ann Gallagher was born June 11, 1964, in Fort Washington, Pa., near Philadelphia. Her track career started at age 7 when she followed her 9-year-old brother, Bart, to his track club. ""He told me I couldn't join the club and not to hang around him,"" she once said. ""I remember I was wearing clogs, and I knew that I was ready to do track, whatever that was. ""When I won my first trophy and it was as big as me, I knew I wanted to someday make the Olympic team."" At 8, she ran a 5:37 mile, the fastest by a girl that age. At 16, she finished eighth in the 800 meters in the Olympic trials. Gallagher attended the University of Arizona for a semester and a half, training with the men's cross-country team. She left college, she said, because ""world-class training and competing for a college don't go hand in hand."" Until college, she had been coached by her brother, Bart, who died in 2000. When she left college, he looked for an experienced coach for her and chose Chuck DeBus in California. DeBus coached her from 1983 to 1988, but he said her health prevented her from completing half her workouts. ""Who knows how fast she could have run if she could have trained like a normal person?"" he told The Los Angeles Times. DeBus was later barred for two years by The Athletics Congress, then the sport's national governing body, for supplying anabolic steroids to his athletes. After Gallagher started training with DeBus, her 5-foot-5 body became muscular, although her weight seldom exceeded 108 pounds. She said she never took steroids. ""I never wanted to look like all those pumped-up, big-looking, talking-weird women,"" she said. ""I liked my looks too much."" Gallagher insisted she never loved the sport. She liked what it brought, especially a Mercedes-Benz and a Malibu home after her 1984 Olympic success. She is survived by her husband; her 13-year-old daughter, Jessica Smith; her mother, Barbara of Philadelphia; and her father, John of Benson, Ariz. She summed up her career by saying: ""I needed to run for all the wrong reasons. I needed to run to keep my shoe contract. I needed to run to pay my bills. I learned a huge lesson. When I ran in the 1984 Olympics, I was going to be a star. I was going to make so much money, and I did. ""But it doesn't last if you're not devoted to what you're doing. I was not devoted to my running, and it showed. I don't get a great joy from running or training or going out and doing all the work. Running is not something I love, but I like excelling at things that I am good at."""

Mr. Dinkins died of cardio-pulmonary arrest, said Leland T. Jones, the Mayor's press secretary. The Mayor, who went to the hospital last night, canceled his appearances that were scheduled for today. William Dinkins moved north from Newport News, Va., in 1925, looking for work and settling in New Jersey with his first wife, Sally. They had two children, David and Joyce. The elder Mr. Dinkins's first job was in a cable factory in Trenton. Soon he became a local barber, and his shop was a popular gathering place in a neighborhood of three-story attached houses. Raised Family in Trenton He also became known in the community through his activities in fraternal, civic and church organizations. He was a 33d Degree Mason, a member of the executive board of the Trenton chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a member of the ethics committee of the Mercer County Board of Realtors and a member and trustee of the Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton. Eventually he started a second career as a real estate and insurance broker that lasted more than two decades. He retired two years ago as the owner and managing broker of Dinkins Real Estate in Trenton. When David Dinkins was 6 years old, his father and mother separated. His father remained in Trenton, and initially the children moved to Harlem with their mother. But they attended school in Trenton and grew up mostly at the home of their father and stepmother, Lottie Hartgell, a schoolteacher. Young David had hoped his parents would reunite. When Mr. Dinkins remarried, the son recalled years later, ""I thought I would die."" The Mayor alluded to his childhood during the recent racial unrest in Crown Heights when he speculated that many youths were from one-parent families and added ""as was the case with me, frankly.""

""He never was a loud type of person,"" said his father, then 83 and living on Spring Street in North Trenton. ""He thought way ahead before he spoke."" The father said David was a well-behaved youngster. ""I never had to spank him or anything like that,"" he said. Not the Political Sort Mr. Dinkins was quoted by The Trenton Times in 1989 as wishing for his son's success running for mayor. But he added, ""I wouldn't want that job for a billion dollars. It's New York, and I don't like politics."" Neither did he want David following in his father's footsteps. ""I certainly didn't want him to be a barber,"" the elder Mr. Dinkins said, ""not when I was only getting 25 cents a haircut, that's for sure."" At the celebration of his son's victory, Mr. Dinkins beamed. ""I'm so proud I don't know what to say,"" he said. Mr. Dinkins's first and second wives are deceased. Besides his two children, the Mayor and Joyce Belton, of Trenton, he is survived by six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were pending."

Jaffe, a former television correspondent who covered the United Nations for CBS News and reported from Moscow, Hong Kong and Vietnam for ABC News, died of lung cancer yesterday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 55 years old. In 1976, Mr. Jaffe told a United States Senate committee that he had reported regularly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on activities of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations in the late 1950's and early 1960's, when he worked for CBS. At the time there were many charges that intelligence agencies had infiltrated news organizations. Mr. Jaffe denied ever taking money from the F.B.I. and said he never worked for the Central Intelligence Agency or any foreign agency. He said he had been unable to find a job in journalism after leaving ABC in 1969 because of a false charge by a Soviet defector that he had once been a Soviet agent. He spent years trying to clear his name by obtaining classified files under his name. A Federal judge in 1983 ruled that all derogatory references to him in the files either came from discredited sources or consisted of gossip or inuendo. His uncle, the actor Sam Jaffe, was unable to find work for years in the 1950's because he was accused by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican of Wisconsin, of associating with Communists. Sam Adason Jaffe was born and grew up in San Francisco, graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and attended Columbia University. He was a reporter for the International New Service in the late 1940's, was a marine in Korea in 1950 and 1951 and was a Life magazine reporter until he joined CBS at the United Nations in 1955.

Italtel, formally Italtel Societa Italiana Telecomunicazione, is the 34th largest company in Italy, according to reports, and one of several telecommunications operations in that nation. When she took over, losses were more than $215 million a year. She cut the losses in half in 1982 and then returned it to profitability, where it has remained under her direction. She wrote her own life story in the book ''Woman and Top Manager,'' frequently worked 12-hour days, but refused to work weekends in order to spend the time with her husband, Lionello Cantoni, a mathematics professor. ''Maybe I can show young girls that you can make it and still be a normal woman, with normal attitudes toward your family or husband,'' she said. Before joining Italtel, Miss Bellisario was president and chief executive of Olivetti of America. She joined the company in 1972 and became director of corporate planning and then director of the Distributed Data Processing group. She became the head of product and operations planning at General Electric Information Systems Italia in 1965 and kept that post when the electronics division was acquired by Honeywell Information Systems Italia in 1969. Miss Bellisario, an economics graduate of Turin University, began her business career in Olivetti's computer division in 1960."

Johnson's war on poverty, died Sunday at a nursing home in Loveland, a Cincinnati suburb.","Theodore M. Berry, a civil rights leader who became Cincinnati's first black mayor after serving as a high official in President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, died Sunday at a nursing home in Loveland, a Cincinnati suburb. He was 94. Mr. Berry fought for racial equality as a civil rights lawyer, representing three Tuskegee Airmen in a famous case; as a leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; and as the official assigned to bring poor people into the policy-making process of the federal anti-poverty effort under Sargent Shriver. He was Cincinnati's first black assistant prosecutor and first black vice mayor before becoming mayor in 1972. Theodore M. Berry was born on Nov. 8, 1905, in Maysville, Ky. The Cincinnati Post quoted Mr. Berry in 1973 as saying that his mother, a deaf-mute housekeeper, was ""taken advantage of by a former employer,"" a white farmer in Maysville. The matter was dropped when the farmer gave his grandmother, a former slave, two hogs. As a child in Cincinnati, Mr. Berry sold newspapers, shined shoes, shoveled coal, delivered laundry and shelved books in libraries. He learned to speak with unusually distinct diction so his mother could read his lips. He graduated at the top of his high school class, but, although he was the school's first black valedictorian, he was forbidden to walk next to a white classmate at the graduation, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported in an obituary published yesterday. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati and then from its law school, working in steel mills to pay his way. His first legal job was as a county prosecutor. He served as president of the Cincinnati branch of the N.A.A.C.P. from 1932 to 1946. In 1942, he took a leave of absence from the prosecutor's office to go to Washington to work as a morale officer with the Office of War Information. His job was to encourage black soldiers, who were then segregated, a situation he saw the government did not intend to end. ""They wanted to play games with"
53925,"Eloy Gutirrez-Menoyo, Cuban Dissident, Dies at 77","Eloy Gutirrez-Menoyo, who went from fighting beside Fidel Castro as a rebel commander to spending 22 years in prison for trying to topple him, died on Friday in Havana, where he had lived his last years as a tolerated dissident.","Eloy Gutirrez-Menoyo, who went from fighting beside Fidel Castro as a rebel commander to spending 22 years in prison for trying to topple him, died on Friday in Havana, where he had lived his last years as a tolerated dissident. He was 77. The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Flor Ester Torres Sanabria, told The Associated Press. On Dec. 8, 1934, Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo was born into a Spanish family dedicated to fighting for freedom: his oldest brother died fighting fascists in Spain's civil war. The family moved from Madrid to Cuba in 1945. In 1957, another brother died in a failed attack against the Cuban strongman Fulgencio Batista. Eloy soon joined the fight against Batista, assembling an army in Cuba's mountains almost as large as Mr. Castro's own force. After Batista fled on Jan. 1, 1959, Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo and his troops arrived in Havana on Jan. 3, days before Mr. Castro led his own army into the city. Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo was not offered a post in the Castro government, and later said he had not wanted one. He retained the rank of major, the highest in Cuba at the time. His army was absorbed into Mr. Castro's. But disturbed with Mr. Castro's turn toward leftist dictatorship, Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo and a dozen military and civilian supporters fled by boat to the United States in January 1961. He settled in Miami and formed an organization to overthrow Mr. Castro, naming it Alpha 66. It was not involved in the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, and it grew to become one of the largest anti-Castro exile groups. In October 1964, Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo led a cadre of men into the Cuban mountains to establish a secure base from which to expand to fight the Communist state, just as Mr. Castro had done to fight the Batista government. He told interviewers that the mission was financed by other exiles, not by the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo and his men were captured by government troops. Blindfolded, he was taken on a 90-minute plane ride, and when the blindfold was removed he found himself facing Mr. Castro, who was sitting behind a desk surrounded by his top aides. ''You realize, of course, that we are going to shoot you,'' he quoted Mr. Castro as saying in a 1987 account in The New York Times Magazine. Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo told Mr. Castro of his family's revolutionary past and said he would accept death. Mr. Castro said he would also kill his men but would spare them if Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo would go on television and affirm that no Cubans wanted to overthrow their government. He accepted the deal and later, after a 30-minute trial, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. As an inmate, Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo refused to work or wear a prison uniform, saying the requirements violated international law covering the treatment of political prisoners. For his refusal he was beaten so badly that he became blind in one eye and deaf in one ear. He spent time in six prisons over 22 years before being released in 1986, largely through the efforts of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzlez of Spain. Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo returned to Miami in 1993 and set up an organization to encourage peaceful dialogue between the Cuban government and antigovernment exiles. He called it Cambio Cubano (Cuban Change). He said he was determined not to be embittered. ''When you spend entire years in solitary, you learn that human beings have a lot of inner resources,'' he told The Times in an interview in 1993. ''When you are subjected to a policy of savagery and barbarism, you come to the conclusion that you have to reject those methods, that you have to be the first to set hatred aside, otherwise it will destroy you.'' In 1995, Mr. Castro agreed to Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo's repeated requests for a meeting. They had a three-hour exchange in Havana, during which Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo pressed Mr. Castro to allow Cambio Cubano to function as an opposition party in Cuba. That never happened, but Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo was allowed to return to Cuba repeatedly and, in 2003, to settle there. He did not succeed in opening an office for his organization, but he did meet with Cuban moderates. ''Cuba cannot continue to corner itself, trying to convince the world that there is democracy, when a one-party system will never be a democracy,'' he said. In addition to his wife, Mr. Gutirrez-Menoyo is survived by three sons and a daughter, The A.P. said. When they met in 1995, he and Mr. Castro had not seen each other since Mr. Castro had threatened to shoot him three decades earlier. Mr. Castro's first"

22051,James Gandolfini Is Dead at 51; Richly Complex Mob Boss in 'Sopranos',"James Gandolfini, the Emmy Award-winning actor who shot to fame on the HBO drama ''The Sopranos'' as Tony Soprano, a tough-talking, hard-living crime boss with a stolid exterior but a rich interior life, died on Wednesday.","James Gandolfini, the Emmy Award-winning actor who shot to fame on the HBO drama ''The Sopranos'' as Tony Soprano, a tough-talking, hard-living crime boss with a stolid exterior but a rich interior life, died on Wednesday. He was 51. Mr. Gandolfini's death was confirmed by HBO. He was traveling in Rome, where he was on vacation and was scheduled to attend the Taormina Film Fest. The cause was not immediately announced; an HBO press representative said that Mr. Gandolfini may have had a heart attack. Mr. Gandolfini, who grew up in Park Ridge, in Bergen County, N.J., came to embody the resilience of the Garden State on ''The Sopranos,'' which made its debut in 1999 and ran for six seasons on HBO. In its pilot episode viewers were introduced to the complicated life of Tony Soprano, a New Jersey mob kingpin who suffers panic attacks and begins seeing a psychiatrist. Over 86 episodes, audiences followed Mr. Gandolfini in the role as he was tormented by his mother (played by Nancy Marchand), his wife (Edie Falco), rival mobsters, the occasional surreal dream sequence and, in 2007, an ambiguous series finale that left millions of viewers wondering whether Tony Soprano had met his fate at a restaurant table. The success of ''The Sopranos'' helped make HBO a dominant player in the competitive field of scripted television programming and transformed Mr. Gandolfini from a character actor into a star. The series, created by David Chase, won two Emmys for outstanding drama series, and Mr. Gandolfini won three Emmys for outstanding lead actor in a drama. He was nominated six times for the award. HBO said of Mr. Gandolfini in a statement on Wednesday, ''He was a special man, a great talent, but more importantly, a gentle and loving person who treated everyone no matter their title or position with equal respect.'' Mr. Chase, in a statement, called Mr. Gandolfini ''one of the greatest actors of this or any time,'' and said, ''A great deal of that genius resided in those sad eyes.'' He added: ''I remember telling him many times: 'You don't get it. You're like Mozart.' There would be silence at the other end of the phone.'' James Joseph Gandolfini Jr. was born in Westwood, N.J., on Sept. 18, 1961. His father was an Italian immigrant who held a number of jobs, including janitor, bricklayer and mason. His mother, Santa, was a high school cafeteria chef. He attended Park Ridge High School and Rutgers University, graduating in 1983 with a degree in communications. He drove a delivery truck, managed nightclubs and tended bar in Manhattan before becoming interested in acting at age 25, when a friend took him to an acting class. He began his movie career in 1987 in the low-budget horror comedy ''Shock! Shock! Shock!'' In 1992 he had a small part in the Broadway revival of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' starring Alec Baldwin and Jessica Lange. By the mid-1990s Mr. Gandolfini had made gangster roles a specialty, playing burly but strangely charming tough guys in films like ''True Romance'' (1993) and ''The Juror'' (1996). He had an impressive list of character-acting credits, but was largely unknown when Mr. Chase cast him in ''The Sopranos'' in 1999. ''I thought it was a wonderful script,'' Mr. Gandolfini told Newsweek in 2001, recalling his audition. ''I thought, 'I can do this.' But I thought they would hire someone a little more debonair, shall we say. A little more appealing to the eye.'' ''The Sopranos,'' which also became a springboard for television writers like Matthew Weiner (who would later create the AMC drama ''Mad Men'') and Terence Winter (who later created the HBO series ''Boardwalk Empire''), drew widespread acclaim for its detailed studies of the lives of its characters, and, at its center, Mr. Gandolfini's portrayal of Tony Soprano, who was tightly wound and prone to acts of furious violence. (He beat and choked another mobster to death for insulting the memory of his beloved deceased racehorse, to name but one example.) Mr. Gandolfini, who had studied the Meisner technique of acting for two years, said that he used it to focus his anger and incorporate it into his performances. In an interview for the television series ''Inside the Actors Studio,'' Mr. Gandolfini said he would deliberately hit himself on the head or stay up all night to evoke the desired reaction. If you are tired, every single thing that somebody does makes you mad, Mr. Gandolfini said in the interview. ''Drink six cups of coffee. Or just walk around with a rock in your shoe. It's silly, but it works.'' Tony Soprano -- and the 2007 finale of ''The Sopranos,'' which cut to black before viewers could learn what plans a mysterious restaurant patron had for Tony as he enjoyed a relaxing meal with his wife and children -- would continue to follow Mr. Gandolfini throughout his career. He went on to play a series of tough guys and heavies, including an angry Brooklyn parent in the Broadway drama ''God of Carnage,'' for which he was nominated for a Tony Award in 2009; the director of the C.I.A. in ''Zero Dark Thirty,'' Kathryn Bigelow's dramatization of the hunt for Osama bin Laden; and a hit man in the 2012 crime thriller ''Killing Them Softly.'' Mr. Gandolfini also produced the documentaries ''Alive Day Memories: Home From Iraq'' and ''Wartorn: 1861-2010,'' about the history of post-traumatic stress in the military. Survivors include his wife, Deborah Lin Gandolfini; a daughter, Liliana, born last year; a teenage son, Michael, from his marriage to Marcella Wudarski, which ended in divorce; and his sisters Leta Gandolfini and Johanna Antonacci. In a 2010 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Gandolfini said that he was not worried about being typecast as Tony Soprano and that he was being offered different kinds of roles as he aged. ''Mostly it's not a lot of that stuff anymore with shooting and killing and dying and blood,'' he said. ''I'm getting a little older, you know. The running and the jumping and killing, it's a little past me.'' Asked why he did not appear in more comedies, he answered, ''Nobody's asked.''"

The police found his body on Wednesday evening at Laurel Canyon Park in the San Fernando Valley, said Sgt. William Davidson. Mr. Rappaport's manager, Frankie Leigh, had filed a missing persons report on Monday, saying the actor was depressed. On March 4, the actor had attempted suicide by inhaling automobile exhaust. The police found him in a car in Hollywood and resuscitated him. The English-born actor, who was 3 feet 11 inches tall, appeared in several episodes of NBC's ''L.A. Law'' since late 1988. He also starred in the 1986-87 television series ''The Wizard,'' about a scientist who invented high-tech toys and gadgets. He also appeared in ''Time Bandits,'' a 1981 British comedy film featuring John Cleese and Sean Connery. In an interview in 1988, Mr. Rappaport said he had suffered discrimination because of his height and wanted simply to be treated like ''a regular, boring, normal person.'' ''I look at boring people every day,'' he said, ''and I say, 'God, I wish I could be like that,' but my lot is to be unique, special, so I have to put up with it. It's a hard life.''"

He was 77 years old and lived in Carmel Highlands, Calif. Mr. James wrote the novel ''Famous All Over Town.'' When it was published in 1983, the name of the author was listed on the book as Danny Santiago, whom the dust jacket described as having grown up in Los Angeles. In fact, Mr. James grew up in Kansas City, Mo., graduated from Andover Academy and said he was the only member of the Yale Class of 1933 to major in classical Greek. Mr. James kept his secret from his literary agent and his publisher until months after the book had been published, when he disclosed he was Danny Santiago to the writer John Gregory Dunne. He chose to use a pseudonym, he said, because he believed he had been blacklisted after he was identified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1951 as having been a member of the Communist Party. He had also lost confidence in his writing ability, he said. Novel Won $5,000 Award Mr. James based the novel on people and places he and his wife knew in the 20 years they spent as volunteer workers in the neighborhood depicted in the book. The review in The New York Times Book Review described ''Famous All Over Town'' as ''an honest, steady novel that presents some hard cultural realities while not for a paragraph failing to entertain.'' The novel won the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation Award, a $5,000 prize for an outstanding work of fiction presented by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Its publisher, Simon & Schuster, had wanted to submit it for the Pulitzer Prize, but the Pulitzer rules required that a photograph be submitted along with the book, and the author had not supplied a photo of himself. Mr. James's use of a Hispanic surname was both denounced and defended by Hispanic-American writers, and he said some friends had warned him against using it. ''But I said the pen name is pretty well established, with Mark Twain, Rabelais and so many others,'' the author said. ''I said nobody's going to be hurt if the book's any good.'' Mr. James is survived by his wife, Lilith, of Carmel Highlands, and by two daughters: Barbara James of Madison, Wis., and Catherine McWilliams of Westchester County, New York."

He died of heart failure, his family said. Mr. Black was widely known in Washington as a friend of politicians in his role as a consultant for military contractors in the post-World War II arms and space races. His downfall stemmed from his secret partnership with Robert G. Baker in the Serv-U Corporation, a vending machine business. Mr. Baker was Secretary of the Senate and a longtime aide to Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1963 a rival vending company's lawsuit against Serv-U disclosed Mr. Baker's and Mr. Black's partnership. That prompted a Senate investigation into Mr. Baker's dealings with a lobbyist, and both men were also prosecuted on income tax evasion charges. In 1964, Mr. Black was convicted of evading $91,000 in taxes and sentenced to up to four years in prison. But the conviction was later overturned and Mr. Black was acquitted in a second trial. In 1982, Mr. Black was prosecuted on charges involving a scheme to launder more than $1 million in Colombian cocaine money. He served seven years in prison.

41871,"Joyce Ann Brown, Shackled by Her Name to Another Woman's Crime, Dies at 68","It was Joyce Ann Brown's great misfortune that long before the 1980 robbery and murder that altered her life forever, she had been arrested on an unrelated charge.","It was Joyce Ann Brown's great misfortune that long before the 1980 robbery and murder that altered her life forever, she had been arrested on an unrelated charge. It was her greater misfortune to have been working for a furrier at the time the crime occurred. But as things played out, it was her greatest misfortune of all simply to have been named Joyce Ann Brown. Ms. Brown, who died on Saturday at 68, was a former Dallas receptionist who in a racially charged case that became a national cause clbre spent nearly a decade in prison for a crime she did not commit. She later became a prisoners' rights advocate. Her death, from a heart attack in a Dallas hospital, was confirmed by James C. McCloskey, the founder of Centurion Ministries, an investigative organization based in Princeton, N.J., that has helped overturn more than 50 wrongful convictions, including Ms. Brown's. Convicted by an all-white jury, Ms. Brown, who was black, received a life sentence for her alleged role in the robbery of a Dallas fur shop -- a competitor of the one where she worked -- in which a man was killed. She served nine years, five months and 24 days before her conviction was set aside. Her case threw into sharp relief issues of race, class, mistaken identity, prosecutorial misconduct, the unreliability of witness memory and the seduction of circumstantial evidence. It was examined on ''60 Minutes'' in 1989 and inspired Ms. Brown's memoir, ''Joyce Ann Brown: Justice Denied'' (1990), written with Jay Gaines. It also inspired the repentance of at least one juror. ''Part of the significance of Joyce Ann Brown's case was that she was one of the first dramatic exonerations, not only in Texas but in the country,'' Jack V. Strickland, one of her defense lawyers, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. About 1 o'clock on the afternoon of May 6, 1980, two women walked into Fine Furs by Rubin, a shop owned by Rubin and Ala Danziger, Holocaust survivors who had settled in Dallas. One of the women, who wore pink pants, ordered the Danzigers at gunpoint to load furs into plastic trash bags. Before leaving, she shot Mr. Danziger, who later died. She and her accomplice, clad in a navy blue jogging suit, fled with the furs in a brown Datsun. Dallas police officers found the car, abandoned, the next day. They learned that it had been rented by a woman named Joyce Ann Brown. An Unshakable Alibi The Joyce Ann Brown around whom the ensuing chain of misapprehension tightened was born Joyce Ann Spencer on Feb. 12, 1947, in Wills Point, in northeast Texas, and raised in Dallas. Her mother, Ruby, was a homemaker; her father, Sylvester, was a domestic worker. Joyce Spencer married a musician named James Brown (not the celebrated one) but was widowed barely two years later, when he was shot and killed in a nightclub brawl. With only a high school education, and needing to help support an extended family that included a daughter, two stepsons and 14 brothers and sisters, Ms. Brown went to work part time as a call girl. She was arrested at least once on prostitution charges. As a result, her name and photograph were on file with the Dallas Police Department -- a record that would years later set in motion her arrest in the Danziger case. At the time of the robbery, Ms. Brown, who had long since found conventional employment, was working as a receptionist at Koslow's Furs in Dallas, about three miles from the Danzigers' shop. Not long afterward, she opened The Dallas Morning News and read to her astonishment that she was wanted for questioning in connection with a capital murder. She resolved to see the police and clear things up. ''Don't go down there,'' her mother later recalled warning her. ''You may not come back.'' Ms. Brown was unconcerned, for she had an unshakable alibi: On the day of the robbery, her office time clock showed her punching in at 8:48 a.m. and out at 4:12 p.m. But her mother's"

24863,"Mary Raftery, 54; Exposed Abuse in Irish Schools","Mary Raftery, a journalist whose television documentaries exposed decades of abuse of needy children in state-sponsored, church-run schools in Ireland, prompting an apology by the prime minister and a government investigation, died on Tuesday in Dublin.","Mary Raftery, a journalist whose television documentaries exposed decades of abuse of needy children in state-sponsored, church-run schools in Ireland, prompting an apology by the prime minister and a government investigation, died on Tuesday in Dublin. She was 54. The cause was cancer, her niece Isolde Raftery said. Ms. Raftery uncovered the child abuse as a producer for Ireland's national broadcasting service, RTE, and brought it to national attention in ''States of Fear,'' a three-part documentary series broadcast in April and May 1999. In examining the state child-care system in Ireland, the series brought to light a Dickensian network of reformatories and residential schools for poor, neglected and abandoned children known as industrial schools. The schools, which were financed and supervised by the government and managed largely by religious orders, mainly Roman Catholic, served about 30,000 children from the 1930s to the 1990s, according to a government report in 2009. The films, making poignant use of interviews with victims, focused on the system in midcentury and presented a horrifying litany of torments the young people suffered at the schools: beatings, semi-starvation, insufficient clothing, filthy living conditions, overwork, emotional abuse and sexual assault. Ms. Raftery was not the first to report on the abuse. In 1970, in what was known as the Kennedy Report, a government commission deplored the mistreatment and recommended that the schools be closed. (Some of the more egregious ones were.) Later, memoirs like ''The God Squad'' by Paddy Doyle and ''Fear of the Collar'' by Patrick Touher, as well as ''Dear Daughter,'' a television documentary about a woman named Christine Buckley, all bore vivid witness to the savagery visited upon children by the school authorities, including priests and nuns. In 1998, the Christian Brothers, a Catholic order that ran many of the most notorious schools in Ireland, issued a public apology to those who had been abused in their care. The widely seen ''States of Fear'' was not only painstakingly researched but also comprehensive, making the powerful case that the abuse had been widespread and systemic. ''What television can do, if you get it right, is it can concentrate and focus a story at a particular time, and make people face it and make people furious,'' Ms. Raftery said in a television interview in 2010. ''So it was a question of constructing a series of programs that wouldn't allow people to go back into denial again, in other"

Kraushaar, the owner of one of New York City's oldest art galleries, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old. She died of natural causes related to old age, said Carole Pesner, the director of Kraushaar Galleries Inc. Miss Kraushaar was born in Manhattan on Dec. 25, 1902, into a family of art dealers, and she spent her life in the New York art world. While still a teen-ager, she went to work as a stenographer in the gallery that her uncle, Charles W. Kraushaar, founded in 1885 and that her father, John Kraushaar, inherited at his brother's death in 1917. Originally on Broadway at 33d Street, Kraushaar Galleries has moved five times in its 107-year history; since 1981, it has occupied a floor in 724 Fifth Avenue, a gallery building near 57th Street. Mrs. Pesner said yesterday that the gallery would continue to operate. In its first years, the gallery concentrated on European artists, especially the Barbizon School of landscape painters. Under Miss Kraushaar's father, it became known for its close association with American artists. For many years it was the primary representative of the sculptor Gaston Lachaise, the painters Guy Pene du Bois and Charles Demuth, and several members of the group of American realists known as ""the Eight,"" most notably George Luks, William Glackens, Maurice Prendergast and John Sloan. In 1917, Luks painted a full-length portrait of Miss Kraushaar in a white graduation dress that has been widely reproduced and exhibited over the years. In the 1920's, Lachaise also sculptured a head of the dealer. Earlier this year, she gave the Luks portrait to the Brooklyn Museum, where it is on view in conjunction with the current exhibition ""The Eight."" Miss Kraushaar took over the running of the gallery when her father became ill in the 1930's and became its owner at his death in 1946. She retired from its day-to-day management in 1988. Under her tenure the gallery continued to exhibit American realists. In the last decade, it has mounted large shows of Glackens and Sloan, and it continues to represent the Luks estate. But it also represents abstract artists, including William Kienbusch, Carl Morris and Sonia Gechtoff. In 1961, Miss Kraushaar was among the handful of New York gallery owners who founded the Art Dealers Association of America; she served for many years on its board. In her later years, she was known for her receptiveness to younger art dealers and the work they exhibited. She is survived by a nephew, Charles W. Kraushaar of Manhattan."

Dr. Morgan perfected methods of improving X-ray images for diagnostic purposes in the 1960's, an advance that was considered as significant as CAT scanning was to became a decade later and magnetic resonance imaging is today. By applying television technology to fluoroscopy, he led the way to several new developments in imaging, including angiography, which enables doctors to examine the interior of blood vessels in the body. ''Russell Morgan contributed magnificently to radiologic science and to the training of generations of scientists,'' said Dr. Martin Donner, director of the Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences at Johns Hopkins.

Mr. Hill's death was reported by a family friend, Joseph Morrissey. In 1954, Mr. Hill was involved in the series of lawsuits against racially segregated public schools that became the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. ''He was among the vanguard in seeking equal opportunity for all individuals, and he was steadfast in his commitment to effect change. He will be missed,'' said L. Douglas Wilder, who in 1989 became the nation's first elected black governor and was a confidant of Mr. Hill's. Mr. Wilder is now the mayor of Richmond. In 1940, Mr. Hill won his first civil rights case in Virginia, one that required equal pay for black and white teachers. Eight years later, he was the first black elected to the Richmond City Council since Reconstruction. A lawsuit argued by Mr. Hill in 1951 on behalf of students protesting deplorable conditions at their high school for blacks in Farmville became one of five cases decided under Brown. Mr. Hill never lost sight of the importance of the 1954 ruling. Without it, he said this year in an interview in The Richmond Times-Dispatch, he doubted that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ''would have gotten to first base.'' Mr. Hill was born May 1, 1907, and his father left when Mr. Hill was an infant. His mother remarried, and Mr. Hill took the name of his stepfather. He moved with his family to Roanoke, Va., where he spent much of his childhood. Later, his family moved to Washington, where he finished high school. He graduated second in his class from Howard University's law school in 1933. The top law graduate that year was his friend Thurgood Marshall. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Hill were part of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund team that fought the desegregation case to the Supreme Court. They remained close friends after Mr. Marshall became the court's first black justice. Though blind and in a wheelchair in recent years, Mr. Hill remained active in social and civil rights causes and in the operations of his law firm until 1998.

Cain, a pioneering conservationist who helped develop the science of ecology and served as an assistant secretary of the Interior Department in the 1960's, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Santa Cruz, Calif. He was 92. Although his academic specialty was botany, Dr. Cain, a Butler College graduate who received his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1930, broadened his scientific interests considerably beyond the world of plants. During a succession of teaching positions at Butler, Indiana University and the University of Tennessee, he focused increasingly on the relationship between people and the environment, coming to believe that industrial and other threats to the land were putting people in increasing peril. Dr. Cain's concerns generally ran ahead of academic science, at least until 1950, when he became a professor at the University of Michigan, where he founded the Department of Conservation, the first academic unit devoted to the specialty. Partly because of his work, conservation became an increasing national concern, and in 1965 Dr. Cain, who had served as chairman of the Michigan Conservation Commission, was named by President Lyndon B. Johnson as Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish, Wildlife and Parks. After his government service ended in 1968, he returned to the University of Michigan, where he became head of the Institute for Environmental Quality until his retirement in 1972. He later taught at the University of California at Santa Cruz. The author of two books and more than 100 articles, Dr. Cain was a pioneer from the beginning of his science career. For his first research paper in 1927, on ecological mapping, he took photographs from a biplane, the first use of aerial photography in the biological sciences. He is survived by a son, Stephen, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and seven grandchildren."
60306,"John Fuller, 76, Playwright, Dies; Wrote Books on the Unexplained","John Fuller, a playwright, documentary film producer and author of many books about the unexplained, died Wednesday at the Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital.","John Fuller, a playwright, documentary film producer and author of many books about the unexplained, died Wednesday at the Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital. He was 76 years old and lived in Weston, Conn. His wife, Elizabeth, said he died of lung cancer. For all his versatility, Mr. Fuller was best known for books about unidentified flying objects, the occult and near-disasters. ""The Ghost of Flight 401,"" published in 1976, was made into a television movie starring Ernest Borgnine. ""The Interrrupted Journey"" (1966), about a couple in Portsmouth, N.H., who under hypnosis relate details of having been taken aboard a space ship and interviewed by its humanoid occupants, became a television movie starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Mr. Fuller's last book, ""The Pack"" (1989), about rats taking over after a nuclear meltdown, is his only novel. John Grant Fuller was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 30, 1913, and graduated from Lafayette College in 1936. For the next 25 years he worked in radio and television and was at various times a writer, director or producer of such shows as ""20th Century,"" ""Du Pont Show of the Week,"" ""The Garry Moore Show,"" ""Candid Camera"" and ""The Great American Dream Machine."" Adapted His Own Work Mr. Fuller wrote two Broadway plays: ""The Pink Elephant"" (1953), a two-act comedy with Steve Allen in the role of a rebellious ghost writer for a politician, and ""Love Me Little"" (1958), a comedy adapted by Mr. Fuller from a novel by Amanda Vail, the pen name of Warren Miller. Mr. Fuller wrote a column for The Saturday Review of Literature from 1957 to 1967, during which time he wrote several books, including ""Incident At Exeter"" (1966), an account of stories told by people in Exeter, N.H., about flying saucers. That experience started Mr. Fuller on a long line of books on similar or related subjects: ""Arigo: The Surgeon With the Rusty Knife"" (1974), ""The Airman Who Would Not Die"" (1979) (1968), ""We Almost Lost Detroit"" (1975) and ""The Poison That Fell From the Sky"" (1978), about the after-effects of a chemical plant explosion in 1976 near the Italian town of Seveso. Used Government Papers Mr. Fuller was sometimes criticized by reviewers for not using footnotes in his books and for what they judged was the implausibility of his topics. But as Jeff Greenfield wrote in The New York Times Book Review in reviewing ""The Poison That Fell From the Sky,"" Mr. Fuller ""keeps raising the most unsettling of questions."" Moreover, even before passage of the Freedom of Information Act, he had a facility for somehow obtaining Government documents, which he incorporated in some of his books. In addition to his wife, Mr. Fuller is survived by their son, Christopher, also of Weston; three sons from a previous marriage, John G., of Toronto; Geoffrey, of New Haven, and Judd, of New York, and a sister, Carol Chambers. A memorial service will be held at 4 P.M. Monday at the Unitarian Church in Westport, Conn."
58691,"George J. Armelagos, Anthropologist Who Told Skeletons' Tales, Dies at 77","George J. Armelagos was a reader of bones. Professor Armelagos (pronounced ar-MEL-ah-gos) was no osteomancer, as one who would divine the future by studying skeletal remains is known.","George J. Armelagos was a reader of bones. Professor Armelagos (pronounced ar-MEL-ah-gos) was no osteomancer, as one who would divine the future by studying skeletal remains is known. Instead, the professor, a distinguished anthropologist who died on May 15 at 77, studied bones to divine the past. His death, from pancreatic cancer at his home in Atlanta, was announced by Emory University, where he was the Goodrich C. White professor of anthropology. Professor Armelagos was one of the founders of paleopathology, a discipline that stands at the nexus of biology, medicine, evolution, archaeology and culture. Where a forensic criminologist might examine a skeleton to determine how its owner died, Professor Armelagos was just as apt to examine it to determine how its owner lived, often many centuries ago. Every malformation of bone, every pit in a skull, every layer of tooth enamel was to him and his colleagues a window onto the past -- and, by extension, a window onto the health and nutritional habits of an entire bygone community. ''Every skeleton has a story to tell,'' Professor Armelagos liked to say, and over time he pored over thousands of them. The stories they told him included these: The surprisingly adverse health effects of agriculture. The presence of syphilis in the New World and the Old and how it got from one to the other. (The date 1492 figures prominently.) The production of an antibiotic, today available only by prescription, by an African community more than a thousand years ago. Professor Armelagos was also the author, with Peter Farb, of ''Consuming Passions'' (1980), a book about the anthropology of eating that includes among its historical tidbits a decidedly peculiar use for prunes. The son of Greek immigrants, George John Armelagos was born on May 22, 1936, in Lincoln Park, Mich., outside Detroit. After earning a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, he entered medical school there but soon changed course after falling under anthropology's spell. He earned a master's in the field from the University of Colorado, followed by a Ph.D. in anthropology there in 1968. Professor Armelagos taught at the University of Utah before taking a post at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where he remained for more than 20 years. Afterward, he taught at the University of Florida, and in 1993 he joined the faculty at Emory, later becoming chairman of the anthropology department. As Professor Armelagos and his associates plied their trade, the bones arrayed before them disclosed surprising things. Some things were counterintuitive, like the finding that agriculture brought corresponding health woes. Examining nearly 600 skeletons from the Dickson Mounds, an Indian burial site in Illinois, Professor Armelagos found that after intensive maize cultivation was adopted around A.D. 1200, the incidence of iron-deficiency anemia (revealed by an expansion of red-blood-cell-producing skeletal regions) rose to 64 percent from 16. Average life expectancy dropped to 19 years from 26. Other findings remain the subject of scholarly debate, like the assertion by Professor Armelagos and collaborators contradicting the long-held view that Columbus carried syphilis from the Old World to the New. Based on their examination of New World skeletons that displayed the bone scarring characteristic of syphilitic infection, they concluded that a progenitor of the syphilis bacterium was already present in pre-Columbian America, where it was manifest as the skin disease yaws. Through sexual contact with American Indians, the researchers argued, Columbus and his crew carried the organism back to Europe. There, mutating, it resulted in an epidemic of full-blown syphilis at the dawn of the 16th century. Still other findings are anachronistically astonishing, like the discovery by Professor Armelagos and associates of traces of the antibiotic tetracycline in 1,400-year-old Nubian skeletons from what is now Sudan. The drug was not introduced commercially until the 1940s. The Nubians were master brewers, and the tetracycline -- born of a bacterium found in soil -- was a spontaneous byproduct of their beer-making process, the researchers concluded. ''Discovering the tetracycline was like unwrapping an Egyptian mummy and seeing a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses strapped to the head,'' Professor Armelagos said in a 2011 interview. ''It was that surprising.'' Professor Armelagos also published articles that sought to debunk the age-old belief that racial difference is rooted in essential biological difference -- a belief, he wrote, that has long been used to justify racism. Professor Armelagos's first marriage, to Adina Armelagos, ended in divorce, as did his second, to Lynn Sibley. His survivors include a son, Gabriel Sibley; two brothers, Nick and James; and two grandchildren. His other books include ''An Unnatural History of Emerging Infections'' (2013, with Ron Barrett) and ''Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture'' (1984), which he edited with Mark Nathan Cohen. He remains best known to a general readership for ''Consuming Passions,'' which chronicled, among other things, the use throughout history of a spate of curious ingredients -- including potatoes and hippopotamus snouts -- thought to be endowed with aphrodisiac powers. In Elizabethan times, the book reveals, prunes were considered aphrodisiacs. Visitors to brothels of the period, Professor Armelagos took delight in disclosing in interviews, received a free prune with every purchase."

39090,"Kevin Carter, a Pulitzer Winner For Sudan Photo, Is Dead at 33","Kevin Carter, the South African photographer whose image of a starving Sudanese toddler stalked by a vulture won him a Pulitzer Prize this year, was found dead on Wednesday night, apparently a suicide, the police said today.","JOHANNESBURG, July 28 Kevin Carter, the South African photographer whose image of a starving Sudanese toddler stalked by a vulture won him a Pulitzer Prize this year, was found dead on Wednesday night, apparently a suicide, the police said today. He was 33. The police said Mr. Carter's body and several letters to friends and family were discovered in his pickup truck, parked in a Johannesburg suburb. They said an inquest showed he died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Mr. Carter began his work as a sports photographer in 1983, but soon moved to the front lines of South African political strife, recording images of repression, anti-apartheid protest and fratricidal violence for several South African newspapers and more recently as a freelance photographer. He was arrested several times for violating a South African ban on reporting of the domestic conflict. Life Close to the Edge A few days after his Pulitzer was announced in April, Mr. Carter was nearby when one of his closest friends and professional companions, Ken Oosterbroek, was shot dead photographing a gun battle in Tokoza township. Friends said Mr. Carter was a man of tumultuous emotions, which brought passion to his work but also drove him to extremes of elation and depression. He often told friends if he had not become a photographer he would have been a race car driver, because he enjoyed living close to the edge. Last year, saying he needed a break from South Africa's turmoil, he paid his own way to the southern Sudan to photograph a civil war and famine he felt the world was overlooking. His picture of an emaciated girl collapsing on the way to a feeding center, as a plump vulture lurked in the background, was published first in The New York Times and The Mail & Guardian, a Johannesburg weekly. Later it was displayed in many other publications as a metaphor for Africa's despair. The reaction to the picture was so strong that The Times published an unusual editors' note on the fate of the girl. Mr. Carter said she resumed her trek to the feeding center. He chased away the vulture. The Horror of the Work Afterward, he told an interviewer in April, he sat under a tree for a long time, ""smoking cigarettes and crying."" ""Kevin always carried around the horror of the work he did,"" his father, Jimmy Carter, told the South African Press Association tonight. Mr. Carter was born in Johannesburg on Sept. 13, 1960. He began as a freelance photographer for The Sunday Express, a tabloid that is now defunct, and moved in 1984 to South Africa's largest daily newspaper, The Star, in Johannesburg. He worked as chief photographer at The Sunday Tribune and started the photo department at The Daily Mail in 1990. He remained with The Mail when it reverted to a weekly format, and last year began full-time work for Reuters. Mr. Carter is survived by his parents, a 6-year-old daughter, and two sisters."

21761,"Herbert M. Allison Jr., 69; Led Bailout Efforts","Herbert M. Allison Jr., a former president of Merrill Lynch who was appointed to lead and help rescue a troubled Fannie Mae and who later ran the federal government's bank bailout program, died on Sunday at his home in Westport, Conn.","Herbert M. Allison Jr., a former president of Merrill Lynch who was appointed to lead and help rescue a troubled Fannie Mae and who later ran the federal government's bank bailout program, died on Sunday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 69. The death was confirmed by his son Andrew, who said the cause was possibly a heart attack. Mr. Allison, a political appointee of both President Obama and President George W. Bush, was put in charge of Fannie Mae in 2008 as part of the Bush administration's effort to rescue it and its sister company, Freddie Mac. The two companies, both government-sponsored, are the nation's largest mortgage finance entities, created during the Depression to help make mortgages more affordable for homeowners. The bailout of the companies, engineered by the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., was one of the most extraordinary and expensive federal interventions in American history, totaling about $180 billion. By taking over the companies and replacing their managements, the administration sought to calm Wall Street concerns that these ''too big to fail'' institutions would go under and take the rest of the housing market -- as well as the entire economy -- with them. Mr. Allison, who at the time had only recently retired as chairman and chief executive of TIAA-CREF, the giant financial services company, replaced Daniel H. Mudd at Fannie Mae after Fannie suffered a staggering $29 billion third-quarter loss in 2008. The losses almost wiped out shareholders entirely as housing prices plummeted, leaving millions of homeowners struggling to pay mortgages that were often larger than the value of their homes. Five years later the government still controls Fannie and Freddie, which are now profitable. After President Obama took office in 2009, he appointed Mr. Allison to the Treasury Department as assistant secretary for financial stability. Mr. Allison had supported Mr. Obama's 2008 presidential run, even though two election cycles earlier he had run the finance committee for Senator John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign. As assistant secretary, Mr. Allison helped oversee the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, the banking industry bailout also created under the Bush administration and endorsed by Mr. Obama. Mr. Allison left the Treasury Department in September 2010, and about a year later the White House appointed him to conduct an independent review of government loans to energy companies after the bankruptcy of Solyndra, a solar panel company that had received government financing under the Obama administration. In a statement on Monday night, Timothy F. Geithner, the former Treasury secretary, described Mr. Allison as ''both a C.E.O. and a statesman, who served his country at a time of peril, bringing financial expertise and commercial judgment to the challenge of saving the American economy from a failing financial system.'' Herbert Monroe Allison Jr. was born on Aug. 2, 1943, in Pittsburgh and grew up on Long Island in Garden City. His father worked for the F.B.I. Mr. Allison earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Yale before earning his master's degree in business at Stanford. ''People used to say that working for Herb was like getting an M.B.A. from Harvard,'' said Steve Goldstein, who was executive vice president under Mr. Allison at TIAA-CREF, ''but he'd correct them and say, 'No, it's like getting an M.B.A. from Stanford.' '' Mr. Allison also served in the Navy as an officer for four years, one of them based in Nha Trang during the war in Vietnam. He began his financial services career at Merrill and remained with it for 28 years, working his way up to president, chief operating officer and member of the board. While at Merrill, he helped coordinate the group of banks that bailed out the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. That same year he oversaw large layoffs after a period of turmoil in the markets. He left in 1999 amid a leadership shake-up. After joining TIAA-CREF (which stands for Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund), Mr. Allison oversaw its downsizing, laying off 500 of its employees, or about 8 percent of the work force. Employees called the dismissals ''Herbicides.'' Mr. Allison was also the founder of a start-up called the Alliance for Lifelong Learning, a joint venture with several universities; a director of Time Warner; and a member of advisory panels at the Yale School of Management, the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He was a director of the New York Stock Exchange from 2003 through 2005. Mr. Allison wrote a book about the financial crisis in 2011, ''The Megabanks Mess,'' in which he argued that the nation's largest banks should be broken up. He was working on another book at his death, his family said. Besides his son Andrew, Mr. Allison is survived by his wife, the former Simin Nazemi; another son, John, and a younger brother, George. Mr. Allison met his wife in Tehran, where he was working for Merrill at the time and she was a secretary to a bank managing director. Before the two could marry, however, her father insisted that Mr. Allison first learn some Persian, his son Andrew said. So Mr. Allison did, building a vocabulary of 1,000 Persian"
11900,LLOYD G. SEALY IS DEAD AT 69; HELD HIGH POSTS WITH POLICE,"Lloyd G. Sealy, a 28-year veteran of the New York City police department who was the first black man to hold a number of top positions on the force, died of a heart attack yesterday, a police spokesman said.","Lloyd G. Sealy, a 28-year veteran of the New York City police department who was the first black man to hold a number of top positions on the force, died of a heart attack yesterday, a police spokesman said. He turned 68 years old yesterday and lived in Brooklyn. Mr. Sealy was stricken as he taught a class at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He had been a professor at the school since his retirement in 1969. ''To black officers in particular he was an inspiring model of what a top-notch policeman can be,'' Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said yesterday. ''He was tremendously valuable to this department.'' In 1964 when rioting struck Harlem and community leaders accused the police of using excessive force against blacks, Mr. Sealy became the first black man to command a Harlem precinct, the 28th. Later, as the first black assistant chief inspector and the commander of 11 Brooklyn precincts, he often accompanied Mayor John V. Lindsay on visits to calm those neighborhoods where racial violence threatened. In those tense times, Mr. Sealy was became something of a symbol. He was the tall, black man in a blue uniform who stood on street corners and waded into crowds on hot summer nights. His calm, resolute presence seemed to affirm to ghetto residents and policemen alike that, even perched on the edge of violence, there was an alternative. ''I try to explain to the Negro groups the role of the policeman and why he's here,'' Mr. Sealy said in the summer of 1964, when he headed the 28th Precinct in Harlem, where the population was mostly black and 80 percent of the officers were white. He added, ''You try to show the police that this is a community of decent people with the same values and same standards as any other community, people who strongly resent any implication that they don't have these values.'' Lloyd George Sealy was born in Manhattan in 1917, the second of three brothers, and grew up in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn, where his father was the janitor of a 10-family apartment buidling. His parents, both natives of Barbados, named him for Britain's Prime Minister during World War I. He was one of only a dozen blacks at Thomas Jefferson High School, but in his senior year, he was elected president of the school's student organization. Mr. Sealy received his bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College, and after working several in low paying jobs in the Federal General Accounting Office in Washington and a railway mail clerk, joined the police force in 1942. In his early career, promotions came slowly. He first served as a patrolman walking the beat in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and five years later was assigned to the youth division where he earned the rank of sergeant. During those years he earned a law degree from Brooklyn Law School. In 1959, he became a lieutenant and was assigned to the confidential squad. He was promoted to captain in 1963. As violence struck Harlem in 1964, Mr. Sealy was given his precinct command, eliciting a warm response from a community where activists charged that the police only enforced the white man's law. And as tensions grew in the following years all around the city, Mr. Sealy experienced a meteoric rise. In September 1966, as an assistant chief inspector, he was given the highest post then held by a black man, the command of uniformed forces in Brooklyn North, which included the Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville sections, the scene of particularly severe racial strife the previous summer. In the following two years, Assistant Chief Inspector Sealy often accompanied Mayor Lindsay and other officials to hear the demands of protestors and help defuse potentially violent confrontations. On one night in July 1967, a group of youths stood before 70 uniformed patrolmen who were tightly gripping their nightsticks.Inspector Sealy, however, avoided violence by ordering his men to step away. He and his officers maintained their composure despite taunts from the youths, including criess of ''Take off your black mask and show us your white face.'' Mr. Sealy resigned from the force in Sept. 1969 to joined the faculty of John Jay College. He is survived by his wife, Estelle, and three daughters, Margaret Newton of West Palm Beach, Fla., Daisy Jones of Washington and Diane Hollis of South Lake Tahoe, Calif."

48951,"Ted Perry, 71, the Founder Of the Hyperion Record Label","Ted Perry, the founder of Hyperion Records, a British classical music label known for exploring the byways of the repertory as devotedly as it does the core literature, died on Sunday in London.","Ted Perry, the founder of Hyperion Records, a British classical music label known for exploring the byways of the repertory as devotedly as it does the core literature, died on Sunday in London. He was 71 and lived in London. The cause was lung cancer, said his daughter Nicola Perry. Mr. Perry, who was born in May 1931, came from a working-class background and became fascinated with music after a childhood hip operation left him in leg braces and unable to participate in sports. He began memorizing the details of record catalogs, not only the works and performers but also the selection numbers for each disc, and in his late teens he was employed to run the record department at EMG Handmade Gramophones, a small but well-known shop in London. When Deutsche Grammophon, the German classical label, opened a London office in 1956, he joined the company to oversee its first British releases. But he remained with the company for only a year, moving to Sydney, Australia, in 1957 to run the marketing and distribution department at Festival Records. Mr. Perry returned to London in 1961 and joinedSaga, a small British label, as its director of artists and repertory. He left the company in 1963 after its management opposed some of his recording plans, but he returned in 1973. In the mid-1970's he left Saga again to start Meridian Records with a partner, John Shuttleworth. And in 1980 he left Meridian to start Hyperion with his wife, Doreen (from whom he was divorced in 1981), and a financial partner, Bill Singer. Hyperion quickly established itself as a label with a taste for the unusual. Among its earliest recordings were the Finzi and Stanford Clarinet Concertos, played by Thea King, and an organ transcription of Mussorgsky's ""Pictures at an Exhibition,"" performed by Arthur Wills. Hyperion quickly won a following among collectors, both for its explorations of otherwise neglected British composers, early Romantics and medieval and Baroque works, and for the warm quality of its sound. Still, in those early years Mr. Perry drove a taxi to supplement his income, and his family spent its evenings packaging discs around the kitchen table. That changed in 1984 when the company released ""Sacred Vocal Music of Monteverdi,"" with the soprano Emma Kirkby, the tenor Ian Partridge and the bass David Thomas, and ""A Feather on the Breath of God,"" a collection of works by the 12th-century abbess Hildegard of Bingen. Both became huge and steady sellers for the label. Mr. Perry went on to build Hyperion into the largest independent classical label in Britain, with a catalog of about 1,200 titles. Among the highlights of its releases was a 36-CD survey of the complete songs of Schubert, overseen by the pianist Graham Johnson, with vocal performances by some of the best Schubert singers of the 1980's and 1990's, among them Dame Janet Baker, Elly Ameling, Arlee Auger, Lucia Popp, Edith Mathis, Anthony Rolfe-Johnson, Thomas Allen, Thomas Hampson and Margaret Price. Mr. Perry is survived by a son, Simon, of London, and two daughters, Louise, of London, and Nicola, of New York."
45579,"Arthur Tracy, 98, Musical Star Known as the Street Singer","Arthur Tracy, the celebrated Street Singer on radio and recordings in the 1930's and 40's, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital.","Arthur Tracy, the celebrated Street Singer on radio and recordings in the 1930's and 40's, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 98 and lived in Manhattan. With his richly romantic voice, Mr. Tracy was a musical star for decades, singing his theme song, ""Marta, Rambling Rose of the Wildwood,"" as well as such ballads as ""When I Grow Too Old to Dream,"" ""I'll See You Again,"" ""Red Sails in the Sunset"" and ""Danny Boy."" He had a comeback in the early 1980's when his 1937 recording of ""Pennies From Heaven"" was heard on the soundtrack of Herbert Ross's movie of that name. The movie starred Steve Martin; Mr. Tracy's voice was lip-synched by Vernal Bagneris. In 1982, at 82, Mr. Tracy began a new cabaret career, appearing at the Cookery in Greenwich Village. Reviewing his performance, John S. Wilson wrote in The New York Times that his voice had ""a delightful patina of period charm."" He added that he was ""a spellbinder, setting a mood and scene, disarming the doubters by admitting that 'I always put all the schmalz I had into my songs.' "" With his clear diction and troubadour manner, Mr. Tracy became known as the most American of singers. Actually, he was born Abba Tracovutsky in Kamenetz-Podolsk in Moldavia (on the borders of Ukraine and Romania). Escaping the pogroms, the Tracovutsky family emigrated to the United States in 1906. He grew up in Philadelphia with his seven siblings. He is survived by a brother, Bert, of Washington. As a child, he displayed a talent for music and sang at weddings and parties. He was soon appearing in vaudeville theaters in Philadelphia and hotels in Atlantic City. From there he went into a touring company of ""Blossom Time,"" and performed in various amateur nights at New York theaters. William S. Paley heard him sing and gave him a 15-minute CBS radio program. Mr. Tracy was going to bill himself as the Vagabond Singer until he realized that Rudy Vallee was known as the Vagabond Lover. Reading about a Frederick Lonsdale play called ""The Street Singer,"" he decided to adopt that as his identity. In 1931, he made his radio debut under that name, and listeners were mesmerized by the mysterious unknown voice. After five months, his identity was revealed and within a year he was in Hollywood appearing in ""The Big Broadcast"" with Bing Crosby, Kate Smith, the Boswell Sisters and other radio stars. In 1935, he visited England, where his recordings were already known. For many years he was one of that country's favorite American entertainers. He made movies in England, including ""Limelight"" with Anna Neagle, ""The Street Singer"" with Margaret Lockwood and ""Command Performance"" with Lilli Palmer. After his re-emergence with ""Pennies From Heaven,"" he acted in the touring company of Andrew Bergman's Broadway play ""Social Security"" and was in the movie ""Crossing Delancey."" In 1996, he was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. His autobiography, ""The Street Singer,"" is to be published this year by Harold Martin & Redman. This week Mr. Tracy's former wife, Blossom, remembered his radio debut: ""The announcer said, 'Down the corner and round your way comes the Street Singer to sing to you his romantic ballads of yesterday and yore.' "" After Mr. Tracy sang, she said, the announcer returned: ""And there he goes, the Street Singer . . . back again tomorrow night to serenade you."" On records, reissued as compact disks, the Street Singer's serenade continues."
17477,"William Hyland, 79; Guided Foreign Policy","William G. Hyland, who helped shape United States foreign policy, particularly toward the Soviet Union, as a top-level bureaucrat and then became editor of the influential journal Foreign Affairs, died on March 25 in Fairfax, Va.","William G. Hyland, who helped shape United States foreign policy, particularly toward the Soviet Union, as a top-level bureaucrat and then became editor of the influential journal Foreign Affairs, died on March 25 in Fairfax, Va. He was 79. The cause was an aortic aneurysm, his son James said. Mr. Hyland, who lived in Vienna, Va., held high posts in the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department and the White House. President Gerald R. Ford named him to a top-level panel to coordinate the intelligence community, and President Jimmy Carter chose him to represent the National Security Council on an interagency committee to guide relations with the Soviet Union. In 1975, when the House Intelligence Committee accused Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger of withholding documents and moved toward holding him in contempt of Congress, Mr. Hyland defended him. Mr. Hyland brokered a compromise through which he personally briefed the committee on the contents of documents, but did not show them to representatives. In a column in The New York Times in 1977, William Safire characterized Mr. Hyland as perhaps the most experienced presidential aide in determining what sensitive information goes into the Oval Office. In the 1980s and '90s, as editor of Foreign Affairs, published by the Council on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Hyland played a part in furthering the journal's role in framing the establishment's discussion of international affairs. Mr. Hyland guided its coverage of the fall of the Soviet Union. In an article in 1991-2, he pointed out that on the 50th anniversary of Congress's declaration of war against Japan, the leaders of three former Soviet republics gathered in Brest to proclaim the end of the Soviet Union. For the first time in a half-century, Mr. Hyland emphasized, the United States was not waging a hot or cold war. This meant, he wrote, that the country was ''freed from the threats and fears that had driven its foreign and domestic policies for half a century.'' In an interview with The Washington Post in 1991, Mr. Hyland urged the United States to take advantage of the new opportunities by tackling domestic problems and ''start selectively disengaging abroad to save resources.'' He named the C.I.A. and other national security agencies to which he had belonged, and suggested that they ''may now be trying to perpetuate something from the past, to give urgency to (international) issues that are no longer all that urgent.'' William George Hyland was born on Jan. 18, 1929, in Kansas City, Mo., and raised there and in Wisconsin. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis as a history major and earned a master's degree in history from the University of Kansas City. Then a private college, it became part of the University of Missouri system in 1963. Mr. Hyland served in the Army's Second Armored Division from 1950 to 1953 and was stationed in Germany. In 1954, he joined the C.I.A.; one of his early jobs was desk officer in Berlin. He rose to head of the Soviet desk in the Office of National Estimates, which combines the analyses of federal intelligence agencies to produce authoritative reports. It was Mr. Hyland's responsibility to estimate the Soviet threat to the United States. He wrote his first book while working for the C.I.A., ''The Fall of Khrushchev'' (1968), an analysis of the Kremlin politics that led to that Soviet leader's downfall. In 1969, Mr. Hyland joined the National Security Council, on which he worked closely with Mr. Kissinger on arms control, presidential summits and other matters. In 1973, after Mr. Kissinger became secretary of state, Mr. Hyland became head of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research at the State Department. In 1975, he returned to the security council to be deputy to Brent Scowcroft, President Ford's national security adviser. Mr. Hyland left government in 1977 to work at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which at the time was affiliated with Georgetown University, and later, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In 1983, he accepted the offer to edit Foreign Affairs, succeeding William P. Bundy, a former assistant secretary of defense and state. In 1988, The New York Times reported that James A. Baker III, then the designated next secretary of state, was considering Mr. Hyland and Lawrence S. Eagleburger to be his deputy secretary, the No. 2 job in the State Department. Mr. Eagleburger got the job and later became secretary of state. In addition to his son James, who lives in Vienna, Va., Mr. Hyland is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Evelyn Sapp; another son, William Jr. of Palm Harbor, Fla.; and four grandchildren. Mr. Hyland, who played the trumpet as a youth, wrote three books about jazz, big bands and Broadway musicals. The first, ''The Song Is Ended: Songwriters and American Music, 1900-1950'' (1995), focused on musical legends like Berlin, Gershwin and Porter. Herbert Swope Jr., in a review in The Palm Beach Post, applauded the result. He wrote, ''Returning to his first love -- popular music -- Hyland treats his subject with the care and seriousness the editor of Foreign Affairs would be expected to give.''"

Robinson, a well-regarded science fiction writer whose credits include a novel adapted for the 1974 blockbuster film ''The Towering Inferno,'' and who was also a speechwriter and adviser to Harvey Milk, the San Francisco city supervisor assassinated in 1978, died on Monday at his home in San Francisco. He was 87. The cause was heart disease and pneumonia, said Robin Wayne Bailey, an author, friend and former president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, which announced the death. Mr. Robinson had moved to San Francisco from Chicago in 1973 to work with a friend and fellow writer, Thomas N. Scortia, on a novel about a skyscraper fire. While writing the book he befriended Mr. Milk, who owned a camera store in the neighborhood. ''The Glass Inferno,'' their 1974 novel, was mined for parts in creating the final script for ''The Towering Inferno,'' the producer Irwin Allen's disaster-film follow-up to ''The Poseidon Adventure'' (1972). Parts of Richard Martin Stern's 1973 novel, ''The Tower,'' also found their way into the movie. All three authors earned screen credit and substantial paydays. Mr. Robinson used his money to settle in San Francisco, and to help Mr. Milk in his quest to become one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country. ''It came up that I was a writer,'' Mr. Robinson said in a 2008 interview with The Chicago Reader, describing the conversation that began his political partnership with Mr. Milk. ''He said, 'Hey, why don't you be my speechwriter? It'll be a hoot.' '' ''I figured it would be a lot of fun,'' Mr. Robinson recalled -- ''and I might meet somebody.'' Mr. Robinson was also gay, but not publicly. In Chicago, where he spent the first half of his life, he had earned his living as a writer and editor for men's magazines like Rogue, Gallery and Playboy. At Playboy, where he worked from 1969 to 1973, he had ghostwritten the ''Playboy Advisor'' column, a colloquium of sex and lifestyle advice for men.) His reputation as a science-fiction author was established with ''The Power,'' a 1956 novel about a man with advanced mental powers. Considered a classic of the paranormal genre, it was made into a television special in 1956 starring Theodore Bikel and a film in 1968 starring George Hamilton and Suzanne Pleshette. In the 1970s and '80s, Mr. Robinson teamed with Mr. Scortia on several projects. Besides ''The Glass Inferno,'' they wrote ''The Prometheus Crisis'' (1975), ''The Nightmare Factor'' (1978) and ''The Gold Crew,'' a nuclear-nightmare thriller. His 1991 novel, ''The Dark Beyond the Stars,'' a space travel reimagining of Christopher Columbus's journey, was selected as one of The New York Times's notable books of the year. Frank Malcolm Robinson was born in Chicago on Aug. 9, 1926. After a tour of duty in the Navy during World War II, he graduated from Beloit College in Wisconsin and then was drafted again to serve in the Korean War. He earned a master's degree in journalism from Northwestern University and worked in the magazine business while writing fiction. He is survived by a brother, Mark. Mr. Robinson had a small role in ''Milk,'' Gus Van Sant's 2008 film about Harvey Milk, and was interviewed extensively by Sean Penn, who played the title role, for his insights about his friend. Mr. Milk was killed along with Mayor George Moscone at San Francisco's City Hall on Nov. 27, 1978, by a disgruntled political rival, Dan White. Mr. Robinson had little or no dialogue in most of his scenes. But at one point he improvised a line, standing at a window to shout a profane coming-out announcement about his sexuality. ''I'll tell my brothers!'' he said. Mr. Van Sant liked the moment well enough to film it a second time. Mr. Robinson had never told anyone in his family that he was gay, neither his parents nor his four brothers. And though the scene did not end up in the film, saying the"
