      " Ben W. Heineman, a lawyer and corporate leader who took over railroads, created\n",
      " one of the nation's first conglomerates and became a close confidant and adviser\n",
      " to President Lyndon B. Johnson, died on Sunday in Waukesha, Wis. He was 98.The\n",
      " cause was a stroke, his son, Ben Jr., said.\n",
      " Joseph A. Califano Jr., who was Johnson's chief domestic aide, said in an\n",
      " interview Thursday that the president had asked him countless times to call Mr.\n",
      " Heineman for advice. He said the president valued Mr. Heineman's business\n",
      " acumen, honesty and grasp of the laws and social programs that the Johnson\n",
      " administration hoped to carry out in areas like civil rights, health, education,\n",
      " pollution control and consumer protection.\n",
      " ''More than anyone, he understood what we were trying to do,'' Mr. Califano\n",
      " said. ''He was quite a selfless person. He had no personal agenda. He told it\n",
      " like it was, which is very hard, and the most important thing you can do for a\n",
      " president or one of his top aides, like me, because people are usually fawning\n",
      " all over you.''\n",
      " While he worked in law or business, Mr. Heineman often held various government\n",
      " jobs in Illinois, nearly all unpaid, serving Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson and Mayor\n",
      " Richard J. Daley of Chicago. Johnson offered him a number of posts -- ambassador\n",
      " to the United Nations, or head of the Commerce Department, Office of Management\n",
      " and Budget or the Department of Health, Education and Welfare -- all of which he\n",
      " declined. He did, however, serve as chairman of the White House Conference on\n",
      " Civil Rights.\n",
      " Mr. Heineman and his family lived in an integrated neighborhood in Chicago, and\n",
      " he considered people who moved out because blacks moved in to be\n",
      " ''reprehensible.''\n",
      " Apart from his government service, Mr. Heineman, who once described himself as\n",
      " ''a professional problem solver,'' had two successful careers: 20 years in law\n",
      " in Chicago, and 30 years in business. He turned toward business in 1954, when he\n",
      " led a group of stockholders in a proxy fight for control of the Minneapolis and\n",
      " St. Louis Railway, which had become known in some quarters as the ''Misery and\n",
      " Still Limping.''\n",
      " In a letter to shareholders, Mr. Heineman's upstart group accused the railroad's\n",
      " managers of running a ''gravy train'' for themselves and called for ''an end to\n",
      " laxness, extravagance and inefficiency.''\n",
      " The rebels won, and Mr. Heineman became chief executive of the railroad.\n",
      " In 1956, he took over a much larger rail system, the Chicago and North Western\n",
      " Railway, which had been notorious for breakdowns and mismanagement. He bought\n",
      " new equipment, made commuter trains run on time and fought the unions, insisting\n",
      " that outdated jobs be eliminated. By 1964, the railroad's $5.5 million deficit\n",
