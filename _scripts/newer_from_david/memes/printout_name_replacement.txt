George A. Nosen, a mental patient who mistakenly brought cockroach poison to cooks rather than powdered milk, causing the deaths of 47 Oregon State Hospital patients in 1942, has died after a scuffle at the institution. He was 68 years old.

 Mr. Nosen was reported to have died Friday after an altercation with a 75- year-old patient.

 More than 400 patients and employees became ill after a dinner of scrambled eggs on Nov. 18, 1942. It was determined the eggs had been laced with sodium fluoride.

 Mr. Nosen was found to have inadvertently taken five to six pounds of white, crystalline poison from a trash can instead of the powdered milk stored in a nearby container.

 Joseph H. Treleaven, the administrator of the State Mental Health Division, said the poisoning probably contributed to major changes at American mental hospitals, which had been criticized after the incident as insufficiently staffed and financed.

Robert J. Stephens, a principal in the New Rochelle, N.Y., school system who directed one of the nation's first elementary-school magnet programs focusing on the humanities, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 51 years old.

 Family members said he died of lymphoma.

 Mr. Stephens was born in Cleveland and received a bachelor's degree at Ohio State University and a master's at Pace University. After teaching in New Jersey and New York City, he joined the New Rochelle system as a teacher in 1971. He directed the magnet program at Daniel Webster Elementary School from 1982 until 1985, when he became Webster's principal. Last year he was named principal for research and evaluation.

 His companion was Cleveland Lovell. He is survived by five sisters, Gladys Wesson and Barbara Huff of Los Angeles; Helen Spears of Columbus, Ohio; Freida Smith of Montclair, N.J., and Jeannette Garrett of Cleveland, and a brother, Gerald, of Cleveland.

Crosby Newell Bonsall, the author and illustrator of more than 40 children's books, died on Jan. 10 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she lived. She was 74.

 The cause was a stroke, said Barbara Phillips, her niece.

 Ms. Bonsall began her career at an advertising agency, where she sold the rights to one of her drawings to a doll manufacturer. She then created a family of dolls, which were used as characters in her first book, "Tell Me Some More," which was published in 1961.

 Although she began as an illustrator, she quickly turned to writing. "Tell Me Some More," illustrated by Fritz Siebel, was published by Harper & Row as part of its I Can Read series, which is still in print. She wrote the text for the photographer Ylla's "I'll Show You Cats" (1964), an award-winning children's book.

 She was born in Kew Gardens, Queens, and studied at the New York University School of Architecture and the American School of Design.

 In addition to Ms. Phillips of Paterson, N.J., she is survived by her husband, George, and a sister, Marion Phillips of Manahawkin, N.J.

Princess Gina of Liechtenstein, wife of the head of state, died today, the Government announced. She was 67 years old.

 The popular Austrian-born Princess had been hospitalized since last month for treatment of an undisclosed illness. A Government communique said her condition suddenly worsened Tuesday.

 She is survived by her 83-year-old husband, Franz Josef II, the world's longest-ruling head of state.

 They married in 1943, five years after Franz Josef II took office as the 12th ruling prince of Liechtenstein, a tiny principality between Austria and Switzerland. In 1984, Franz Josef II turned over the running of the country to his son, Hans Adam, oldest of their five children, but he remained head of state.

[Romano Mussolini, Mr. Mussolini, Benito Mussolini, Duke Ellington, Chet Baker, Mr. Mussolini, Mr. Mussolini, Giovanni Alemanno, Mr. Mussolini]
Romano Mussolini, the Italian jazz pianist whose fame as the fifth and youngest child of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was ultimately rivaled by his musical renown, died on Tuesday in Rome. He was 79.

 His death was announced on the Web site of the small right-wing party Alternativa Sociale, which is led by his daughter Alessandra. He had been hospitalized since Jan. 21 after a series of ailments.

 Born in 1927 in Carpena di Forli in Northern Italy, Mr. Mussolini was the third and youngest son of Benito Mussolini and Donna Rachele Guidi, who also had two daughters.

 Amid the censorship under Italian fascism, it was Mr. Mussolini's older brother Vittorio who introduced him to film and music; he also painted and made movies.

 In the 1950's and 60's he was in the vanguard of Italian jazz with his group the Romano Mussolini All Stars, and he played with American greats like Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington and Chet Baker.

 Mr. Mussolini gained even greater international fame with his first marriage, to Anna Maria Scicolone, the sister of the actress Sophia Loren. His second marriage was to the actress Carla Maria Puccini. She survives him, along with two daughters from his first marriage, Alessandra and Elisabetta, and a daughter with Ms. Puccini, Rachele.

 At times the Mussolini surname proved disadvantageous to his career, and early on he would often play under an alias in and around Naples.

 Despite his own scrupulous avoidance of politics, politicians from Italy's right wing-parties widely lauded Mr. Mussolini and his family name in statements they released Friday.

 Giovanni Alemanno, the center-right Italian agricultural minister, said, ''Romano knew how to make us love him for his humanity, his art, but also for the dignity and coherence with which he defended his family from attacks and demonizations.''

 Mr. Mussolini condemned the anti-Semitic laws of his father's regime, which resulted in the deportation of more than 7,000 Jews, but recalled his father and his relationship with him in a favorable light. In 2004, he broke a self-imposed silence about his father and his legacy with the publication of his memoir, ''Il Duce, My Father,'' in which he fondly recalled his father as a sensitive and caring man.

George K. Fraenkel, one of the first chemists to use electronic techniques to explore the fundamental structure of molecules, a breakthrough that has led to advances in several fields of science, died in Manhattan on June 10. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.

 His wife, Eva Stolz Fraenkel, confirmed the death.

 Dr. Fraenkel was chairman of the chemistry department at Columbia University from 1965 until 1968, when he was appointed dean of the university's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

 Starting in the early 1950s, when he was a professor, Dr. Fraenkel was one of several chemists who developed high-sensitivity, high-resolution spectrometers that could track the spin of electrons and thereby obtain information on very small structures.

 ''His work has laid the foundation for later work toward understanding the properties of many biological systems,'' Jack H. Freed, the Frank and Robert Laughlin professor of physical chemistry at Cornell University, said in an interview on Friday.

 Dr. Fraenkel's research helped develop and apply techniques of what is called electron spin resonance for applications in chemistry research, including determining the electronic structure of molecules and how molecules move in liquids. Dr. Freed said the methods Dr. Fraenkel helped pioneer had since been applied to research in physics, biology and medicine.

 Among other developments based on Dr. Fraenkel's work, ''we are now determining the structure and function of medically important proteins implicated in Parkinson's disease, how viral proteins insert themselves into cells, medical imaging, memory function and quantum computing,'' Dr. Freed said.

 George Kessler Fraenkel was born in Deal, N.J., on July 27, 1921, and grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was one of three children of Osmond and Helene Esberg Fraenkel. His father was general counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union.

 Dr. Fraenkel graduated from Harvard in 1942. His graduate studies at Harvard were interrupted when he was hired by the National Defense Research Committee and placed in charge of a team that developed electronic equipment to measure the explosive power of bombs. After World War II, he enrolled at Cornell, where he received his doctorate in 1949. Soon after, he was hired as an instructor at Columbia.

 Dr. Fraenkel was dean of Columbia's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1968 until 1983 and its vice president for special projects from 1983 to 1986. He returned to the chemistry department in 1986 and continued to teach until his retirement in 1991.

 Dr. Fraenkel's first two marriages ended in divorce. Besides his wife, whom he married in 1990, Dr. Fraenkel is survived by his sister, Nancy Wechsler; six stepchildren, Patricia, William, Louis, Eva, Mary Anne and Charles Gilleran; and one step-granddaughter.

Aaron W. Warner, a left-leaning lawyer who began his career as one of Felix Frankfurter's "bright young men" in the New Deal, and then switched careers at 46 to be a Columbia University professor and administrator for almost half a century, died on Aug. 25 in Manhattan. He was 92.

 At Columbia, Dr. Warner helped frame the university's response to the 1968 student demonstrations and strove to broaden the university's reach, first as dean of the School of General Studies, which offers college courses to working adults, and then as dean of continuing education. He was also director of the University Seminars, which each year draw 3,000 people from academia and myriad other fields to address topics like Middle East politics, the cinema and brain chemistry.

 He did not resign as director of the seminars until last July, and he played tennis until 1986 and the piano until last year -- only Mozart and Chopin, as always. His final work, a collection of articles that he edited to honor his Columbia colleague William S. Vickrey, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, will be published later this year.

 It was hardly surprising that his response to a surprise birthday cake on his 90th birthday was real, not feigned, anger, recalled Anissa Bouziane, who was his assistant in running the seminars.

 He complained, "Nobody's supposed to know I'm this old."

 Aaron Warner, who lived in Manhattan, was born in Newark on May 16, 1908. He was given no middle name, but later added the W., which stood for nothing. He became an accomplished pianist and was awarded a scholarship to the Institute of Musical Art, which later became the Juilliard School. He graduated from New York University, and then went to Harvard, where he simultaneously earned a master's degree in English and a law degree, studying under Frankfurter, who later became a Supreme Court justice.

 He then practiced law with a Boston firm for four years, but was fired in 1934 for representing demonstrators who opposed the docking of a ship from Nazi Germany. The firm's principal, Harry N. Guterman, said he had no permission to take the case.

 In 1937, he was appointed regional director of the National Labor Relations Board in Denver, the youngest person to hold such a position, according to news reports at the time. He later held the same post in Los Angeles before becoming special examiner for all the board's regional offices.

 A fierce supporter of the rights of workers, he was quoted in The Salt Lake Tribune in 1939 as saying, "In guaranteeing the rights of workers to organize, we are strengthening those forces which will enable us to remain a free people long after other nations with less foresight have felt the crushing heel of fascism."

 While he was at the labor board, his former boss, Mr. Guterman, approached Representative John W. McCormack, a Democrat of Massachusetts, who later became speaker of the House, to suggest that Dr. Warner harbored "radical sympathies." This resulted in a House investigation, which eventually cleared him of charges that he was a Communist.

 He then worked for the Railroad Retirement Board and was chief of field operations for the administration of wartime price controls. In 1943, he joined the Navy as an enlisted man and served for three years in the Pacific.

 While he was away at war, his wife, the former Charlotte Rosen, recovered from tuberculosis and decided to go to medical school. When he returned, he also wanted a new beginning. He enrolled in Columbia to study economics. "He figured that if she could become a doctor, he had to have a doctorate," their son-in-law Alan Myerson said.

 After earning his Ph.D. in 1954, he became a Columbia professor, specializing in labor issues. He was named the Joseph Buttenwieser professor of human relations in 1967. As a member of a faculty committee appointed to deal with educational planning after student protests in 1968, Dr. Warner fought "the old school boy, old boy Columbia College mold," said Ms. Bouziane, his former assistant.

 Soon after, he was named dean of the School of General Studies, and the position gave him an opportunity to make it easier for working people to take Columbia courses. After his retirement from that school at 68, he spent two years as dean of the university's School of Continuing Education, which serves older adults.

 "Older people are good people to teach," he told an interviewer in 1976. "We find them very highly motivated, very thoughtful people, and usually highly intelligent. Their life experience is rich."

 A modest man with twinkling green-gray eyes, Dr. Warner also took charge of the University Seminars, which began in 1945. Those he introduced included one in 1962 on technology and social change, which spawned a series of books he edited, and one in 1983 on philanthropy.

 "What we look for," Dr. Warner said in an interview in 1984, "are leading people in the field from different disciplines, preferably from both on and off campus. We look for subjects which are critical from the point of view of intellectual challenge and which seem to have lasting value."

 The program has produced a great treasure: the minutes of each seminar, which are stored on crammed bookshelves. "If you want to find out what Margaret Mead said on June 15, 1959, you can find out," Dr. Warner said.

 His wife Charlotte died in 1970. He is survived by his second wife, whom he married in 1971, the former Miriam Firestone; two daughters, Rachel Warner of Washington, D.C., and Abby Myerson of Los Angeles; a sister, Miriam Rosen of Maplewood, N.J.; and six grandchildren.

 Several years ago, Dr. Warner asked Abby and Alan Myerson, who are tournament bridge players, to explain the rules of the game, Mr. Myerson recalled. That evening, he accompanied them to a tournament and was one of the top players.

Frank Mickens, a blunt, no-nonsense principal who brought order and significant academic improvement to what was once one of New York City's most troubled schools, Boys and Girls High School in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, died Thursday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 63.

 He died of natural causes, his cousin Sharon Rose said.

 Mr. Mickens, a mock-gruff bear of a man, took over Boys and Girls High in 1986, when it seemed to be more in the hands of hardened youths from the neighborhood's streets than controlled by the faculty.

 Though Bedford-Stuyvesant has experienced a degree of gentrification in recent years, back then it was tormented by gangs, drug dealing and drive-by shootings. Mr. Mickens created a haven within the walls of the school, at 1700 Fulton Street, and a chance for children to succeed.

 ''We service seven or eight of the toughest housing projects in the city,'' Mr. Mickens said in 1993. ''I have a simple proposition: This is my house. I'm 46 years old. A 15-year-old is not going to dictate to me how this school is run.''

 Mr. Mickens's efforts drew national attention and were compared to those of Joe Clark, the baseball-bat-wielding principal in Paterson, N.J., who was the subject of the movie ''Lean on Me.'' Like Mr. Clark, he drew criticism from some educators, who questioned whether his tough measures translated into academic success.

 To a degree, they did. In his first seven years as principal, the school's graduation rate rose to 40.5 percent from 24.4 percent. In 2004, the year he retired, it was 47.5 percent.

 Mr. Mickens brought an array of tactics to his law-and-order philosophy. In his first semester as principal, he forbade students to wear hats in school or listen to Walkmans. He went on to ban ripped jeans, sneakers with lights in the heels, ''excessive jewelry'' and decorative gold tooth caps -- and sometimes mandated what students wore.

 Two days a week, the school's 2,000 boys were required to ''dress for success'' by wearing a dress shirt and necktie to class. If a student could not afford a tie, Mr. Mickens provided one. The school's 2,500 girls were also required to dress appropriately for success in the working world.

 Critics said the dress codes violated the students' rights. But in October 1990, on the first Dress for Success Day, 400 seniors in the auditorium gave their principal a standing ovation and chanted: ''Go, Mickens!''

 Mr. Mickens instituted the dress code, he said, to enhance self-respect, but also because he was tired of attending funerals of students who had been killed over their clothing.

 Every school morning and then at dismissal time, Mr. Mickens led a patrol of teachers around the school's perimeter to keep drug dealers and other potential troublemakers from approaching students. Teachers on patrol were equipped with walkie-talkies. On the day before Halloween, teachers would help Mr. Mickens empty out lockers to make sure students were not stashing fireworks or eggs to throw at one another.

 To deal with unruly and truant students, Mr. Mickens created two programs. In his Principal's Academy, students with disciplinary problems received individual attention in separate classes. Another program was for students with more than 50 absences the previous year.

 ''He's a father figure,'' one senior said of Mr. Mickens in 1993. ''He's about discipline and he's from the old school.''

 Frank Nathaniel Mickens was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant on June 22, 1946, the only child of John and Hortense Mickens. His father was a furrier and his mother a teacher. Mr. Mickens, who was single, had no immediate survivors.

 After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, Mr. Mickens received a bachelor's degree in history from the State University of New York at Potsdam in 1968; he later received a master's degree from New York University.

 At 22, Mr. Mickens was hired as a teacher and basketball coach at Boys and Girls High. In his 10 years as coach, his team won six division titles; was runner-up in the Public Schools Athletic League championship in 1971; and won the P.S.A.L. title in 1978-79.

 From 1982 to 1986, Mr. Mickens was principal of a junior high school in Bedford-Stuyvesant and then principal of Martin Luther King Jr. High School in Manhattan. He returned to Boys and Girls High in 1986.

 In 2000, Muhamed Berte -- a senior at Boys and Girls High who had once been robbed on the way to school and on another day dodged bullets in the crossfire of rival gangs -- graduated and was headed for college. ''I'm so excited about his graduation I don't know what to do,'' Mr. Mickens said of Mr. Berte that day. ''These kids are survivors.''

John Rau, a leading figure in the early days of contract bridge, died in Walnut Creek, Calif., Friday night. He was 73 years old and had been suffering from cancer.

 Mr. Rau, a New York resident until his retirement to California, was a sales executive concerned with package design. In 1930, when contract bridge was less than five years old, Mr. Rau, then 22, and an even younger partner, William Barrett, created a sensation in their first national tournament by the extensive use of psychic or bluff bids, which had never before been used in tournament play.
